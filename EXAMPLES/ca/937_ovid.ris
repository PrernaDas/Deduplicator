N2  - We aimed to explore the association of key clinical characteristics with disease severity in atopic dermatitis (AD) and its relation to components of the atopic march in a large hospital cohort. Outpatients with AD referred to the Department of Dermatology, Bispebjerg Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark, between January 2012 and December 2017, were compared based on disease severity (SCORAD); mild (< 25), moderate (25-50) and severe (> 50). A total of 470 AD patients were included: 122 small children (< 4 years of age), 103 children/adolescents (age 4-15 years) and 245 adults (> 15 years of age). A significant difference between severity groups in small children was observed for FLG mutation carrier status (16.7 vs. 30.2 vs. 60.0% mutation carriers among patients with mild, moderate and severe AD, respectively, p = 0.012) and self-rated health (3.2 vs. 2.7 vs. 2.8 with 4 being excellent health, p = 0.022). A significant difference between severity groups in adults was observed for male sex (24.4 vs. 39.8 vs. 52.9%, p = 0.003), serum total IgE (577 vs. 1269 vs. 2379 x 103 IU/L, p < 0.001), blood eosinophil count (0.28 vs. 0.39 vs. 0.61 x 109/L, p < 0.001) and asthma (42.9 vs. 38.8 vs. 72.0%, p < 0.001). Early onset of AD (< 1 year of age) and FLG mutation was associated with more severe disease and high serum total IgE levels. In conclusion, the distribution of key clinical characteristics varies significantly according to the severity of AD measured by SCORAD. Sub-typing of AD patients related to determinants of disease severity may be helpful in establishing prognosis and targeted treatment of AD.

N2  - Systematic reviews suggest that breastfeeding is associated with a lower risk of asthma, although marked heterogeneity exists. Using UK Millennium Cohort Study data (n = 10,126 children, born 2000-2002), we examined the association between breastfeeding duration and wheezing in the previous year, first for each age group separately (ages 9 months, 3 years, 5 years, 7 years, and 11 years) and then in terms of a longitudinal wheezing phenotype: "early transient" (wheezing any time up to age 5 years but not thereafter), "late onset" (any time from age 7 years but not beforehand), and "persistent" (any time up to age 5 years and any time from age 7 years). The association between breastfeeding and wheeze varied by age (2-sided P for interaction = 0.0003). For example, breastfeeding for 6-9 months was associated with lower odds of wheezing at ages 9 months, 3 years, and 5 years but less so at ages 7 years and 11 years (adjusted odds ratios = 0.73, 0.78, 0.79, 0.84, 1.06, respectively). There was a strong dose-response relationship for breastfeeding per month and early transient wheeze (adjusted odds ratio for linear trend = 0.961, 95% confidence interval: 0.942, 0.980) but no clear trend for late-onset or persistent wheeze. Our results identified heterogeneity in the association between breastfeeding and wheezing according to age at wheezing and wheezing phenotype.

N2  - We examined temporal dependencies between repeated assessments of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and asthma in children in the Leicester Respiratory Cohort, Leicestershire, United Kingdom. Information associated with asthma (i.e., doctor diagnosis, health care visits, wheeze frequency) and RTIs (i.e., cold duration and frequency, cough with colds, ear infections) in the previous 12 months was assessed repeatedly at ages 1, 4, and 6 years for children born between April 1996 and April 1997. We determined associations between contemporaneous and lagged measures of asthma and RTIs, using structural equation modelling. In 1,995 children, asthma was positively associated with contemporaneous infections. Asthma at age 6 years was positively associated with asthma at age 4 years (regression coefficient = 0.87; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.76, 0.97), but not with asthma at age 1 year (regression coefficient = -0.01; 95% CI: -0.14, 0.11). We found no evidence for direct protective effect of infections at age 1 year on asthma either at age 4 (regression coefficient = -0.20; 95% CI: -0.51, 0.10) or 6 (regression coefficient = 0.24; 95% CI: -0.04, 0.52) years. Adjusting for potential confounders did not qualitatively change those relationships. Based on our findings, we suggest that asthma at age 6 years is directly influenced by asthma history and only indirectly, if at all, by earlier infection episodes. We found little support for a protective effect of preschool infections on asthma at early school age.

N2  - We assessed the association between the natural environment and asthma in 49,956 New Zealand children born in 1998 and followed up until 2016 using routinely collected data. Children who lived in greener areas, as measured by the normalized difference vegetation index, were less likely to be asthmatic: a 1 s.d. increase in normalized difference vegetation index was associated with a 6.0% (95% CI 1.9-9.9%) lower risk of asthma. Vegetation diversity was also protective: a 1 s.d. increase in the number of natural land-cover types in a child's residential meshblock was associated with a 6.7% (95% CI 1.5-11.5%) lower risk. However, not all land-cover types were protective. A 1 s.d. increase in the area covered by gorse (Ulex europaeus) or exotic conifers, both non-native, low-biodiversity land-cover types, was associated with a 3.2% (95% CI 0.0-6.0%) and 4.2% (95% CI 0.9-7.5%) increased risk of asthma, respectively. The results suggest that exposure to greenness and vegetation diversity may be protective of asthma.

N1  - Comment in (CIN)
N2  - Antibiotic use during infancy alters gut microbiota and immune development and is associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma. The impact of prenatal antibiotic exposure is unclear. We sought to characterise the association between prenatal antibiotic exposure and childhood asthma.We performed a population-based cohort study using prescription records, hospitalisation records and physician billing claims from 213 661 mother-child dyads born in Manitoba, Canada between 1996 and 2012. Associations were determined using Cox regression, adjusting for maternal asthma, postnatal antibiotics and other potential confounders. Sensitivity analyses evaluated maternal antibiotic use before and after pregnancy.36.8% of children were exposed prenatally to antibiotics and 10.1% developed asthma. Prenatal antibiotic exposure was associated with an increased risk of asthma (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.23, 95% CI 1.20-1.27). There was an apparent dose response (aHR 1.15, 95% CI 1.11-1.18 for one course; aHR 1.26, 95% CI 1.21-1.32 for two courses; and aHR 1.51, 95% CI 1.44-1.59 for three or more courses). Maternal antibiotic use during 9 months before pregnancy (aHR 1.27, 95% CI 1.24-1.31) and 9 months postpartum (aHR 1.32, 95% CI 1.28-1.36) were similarly associated with asthma.Prenatal antibiotic exposure was associated with a dose-dependent increase in asthma risk. However, similar associations were observed for maternal antibiotic use before and after pregnancy, suggesting the association is either not directly causal, or not specific to pregnancy.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Both virus-induced asthma and enterovirus (EV) infection are common in children; however, the relationship between EV infection and virus-induced asthma has not been systematically investigated in a cohort study. This nationwide population-based cohort study investigated the association between EV infection and asthma., METHODS: We used data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The study sample consisted of insured children who were younger than 18 years and had EV infection between 1997 and 2013 and were followed until December 2013. We identified 36,935 children with EV infection and compared them based on 36,935 age-, sex-, urbanization- and income-matched controls to analyze the risk of subsequent asthma. Cox regression analyses were performed and adjusted for sex, age, urbanization, income, preterm labor and small for gestational age, perinatal complications, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, atopic dermatitis and bronchiolitis., RESULTS: The mean follow-up interval for all patients was 8.59 years (standard deviation = 4.35 years). The mean latency period between initial EV infection and onset of asthma was 2.77 years (standard deviation = 2.43 years). EV infection was significantly associated with a higher incidence of asthma (hazard ratio = 1.65; 95% confidence interval: 1.60-1.71)., CONCLUSIONS: A significant association was observed between EV infection and asthma in children. Health providers should be aware of the higher potential for children with EV to develop asthma in the future.

N2  - This investigation determined the effects of air pollution on childhood asthma hospitalization in regions with differing air pollution levels in Taiwan over a long time period. Data of childhood hospital admissions for asthma in patients aged 0-18 years and air quality in eight regions for the period 2001-2012 in Taiwan were collected. Poisson generalized linear regression analysis was employed to identify the relative risks of hospitalization due to asthma in children associated with exposure to varying levels of air pollutants with a change in the interquartile range after adjusting for temperature and relative humidity. Particulate matter <=2.5 mum (PM2.5), particulate matter <=10 mum (PM10), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), were positively associated with childhood asthma hospitalization, while O3 was negatively associated with childhood asthma hospitalization. SO2 was identified as the most significant risk factor. The relative risks for asthma hospitalization associated with air pollutants were higher among children aged 0-5 years than aged 6-18 years and were higher among males than females. The effects of air pollution on childhood asthma were greater in the higher-level air pollution regions, while no association was observed in the lower-level air pollution regions. These findings may prove important for policymakers involved in implementing policies to reduce air pollution.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Five studies carried out after bronchiolitis at less than 24 months of age, with a follow-up of more than 10 years, reported that atopic dermatitis, family asthma, early-life exposure to tobacco smoke and rhinovirus aetiology were early-life risk factors for later asthma. This study evaluated the long-term outcome at 11-13 years of age of children who were hospitalized for bronchiolitis in early infancy., METHODS: We previously prospectively followed 166 children hospitalized for bronchiolitis at less than 6 months of age until 5-7 years of age. The current study included a structured questionnaire, parental interviews, clinical examinations and bronchodilation test of 138 of those children at 11-13 years of age., RESULTS: Respiratory syncytial virus caused 66% of the bronchiolitis cases, and nearly half of the patients were exposed to tobacco smoke in early life. Doctor-diagnosed asthma was present in 13% of the former bronchiolitis patients at 11-13 years of age. Maternal asthma was the only independently significant risk factor in early life (adjusted OR 3.45, 95% CI 1.07-11.74), as was allergic rhinitis at 5-7 years of age (adjusted OR 4.06, 95% CI 1.35-12.25)., CONCLUSIONS: After bronchiolitis at less than 6 months of age, the risk of doctor-diagnosed asthma at 11-13 years was about twice that of the general Finnish population. Maternal asthma was the only independently significant early-life risk factor for current asthma at 11-13 years of age. Copyright © 2017 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

N2  - Background: Mothers' smoking during pregnancy increases asthma risk in their offspring. There is some evidence that grandmothers' smoking may have a similar effect, and biological plausibility that fathers' smoking during adolescence may influence offspring's health through transmittable epigenetic changes in sperm precursor cells. We evaluated the three-generation associations of tobacco smoking with asthma., Methods: Between 2010 and 2013, at the European Community Respiratory Health Survey III clinical interview, 2233 mothers and 1964 fathers from 26 centres reported whether their offspring (aged <=51 years) had ever had asthma and whether it had coexisted with nasal allergies or not. Mothers and fathers also provided information on their parents' (grandparents) and their own asthma, education and smoking history. Multilevel mediation models within a multicentre three-generation framework were fitted separately within the maternal (4666 offspring) and paternal (4192 offspring) lines., Results: Fathers' smoking before they were 15 [relative risk ratio (RRR) = 1.43, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-2.01] and mothers' smoking during pregnancy (RRR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.01-1.59) were associated with asthma without nasal allergies in their offspring. Grandmothers' smoking during pregnancy was associated with asthma in their daughters [odds ratio (OR) = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.17-2.06] and with asthma with nasal allergies in their grandchildren within the maternal line (RRR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.02-1.55)., Conclusions: Fathers' smoking during early adolescence and grandmothers' and mothers' smoking during pregnancy may independently increase asthma risk in offspring. Thus, risk factors for asthma should be sought in both parents and before conception., Funding: European Union (Horizon 2020, GA-633212).

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Asthma and allergic rhinitis (AR) frequently occur as comorbid diseases of the upper airways. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FCRL3 and FCRL5 genes have recently been shown to be associated with various immune-related disorders. This study evaluated the association of FCRL3 and FCRL5 polymorphisms with asthma and allergic rhinitis (AR) in a Han Chinese population., METHODS: Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the FCRL3 and FCRL5 were genotyped in 300 asthmatic children, and 206 healthy unrelated individuals using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay. Genotyping was validated by direct sequencing., RESULTS: Our results showed that the frequencies of the rs6692977 CT genotype and T allele within FCRL5 were significantly higher in asthma with comorbid AR compared to healthy controls (Bonferroni-corrected p (Pc)=3.75x10-6; Pc=0.006, respectively), whereas these of the CC genotype and C allele were significantly lower (Pc=4.15x10-5; Pc=0.006, respectively). The frequencies of the rs7528684 A allele (Pc=1.80x10-3) and the rs10489678G allele (Pc=0.04) within FCRL3 were higher in asthma with comorbid AR than in controls. However, no differences in the tested genetic polymorphisms were detected between asthma and healthy individuals., CONCLUSION: This study identified novel SNPs in FCRL3 and FCRL5 significantly associated with the risk for asthma with comorbid AR in the Chinese population. The genetic variants may play role in the development of the asthma phenotype in children with asthma. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in early infancy and health conditions such as asthma and respiratory allergies at 6 years of age in a cohort of US children born at term with no medical issues at birth., METHODS: Data (1542 records) from the Infant Feeding Practices Study II and the Year Six Follow-Up study were used in the analysis. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were conducted to estimate the magnitude and direction of potential associations between children's health conditions such as asthma, hay fever, or respiratory allergy, and RSV infection during infancy., RESULTS: A substantial proportion of children with RSV infection in infancy were reported to have developed asthma (10.3%) and hay fever or respiratory allergy (9.4%) by 6 years of age. Analyses revealed that children with RSV infection in infancy were more likely to develop asthma (odds ratio 1.99, 95% confidence interval 1.06-3.74), and hay fever or respiratory allergy (odds ratio 2.13, 95% confidence interval 1.28-3.57) by 6 years of age. In addition, the risk of developing asthma and hay fever or respiratory allergy by 6 years of age increased considerably with a family history of these conditions., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the need for understanding and monitoring the long-term health outcomes of RSV infection in infancy. Appropriate prevention and treatment measures for RSV infection during infancy may reduce the incidence of associated long-term adverse health outcomes. Knowledge of the long-term complications of RSV infection in infancy, such as asthma, hay fever, or respiratory allergy, can aid in the prevention and better management of these health conditions.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the prevalence and the relationship between asthma, eczema, food allergy, and rhinitis in children after liver transplantation., STUDY DESIGN: Children who were liver transplant recipients were investigated to assess whether the high prevalence of food allergies was accompanied by eczema, rhinitis, and asthma. Furthermore, we included 56 children with chronic liver disease to explore the risk of allergy, eczema, and asthma in this group., RESULTS: After liver transplantation, children had higher prevalence of allergic reactions to food as compared with children with chronic liver disease (P < .001). Current asthma (P = .04) and eczema (P < .02) were observed more frequently in transplanted children as compared with children with chronic liver disease. For transplanted children who had ever received tacrolimus the relative risk (RR) of asthma was 1.7 (95% CI, 1.2-2.4; P = .02) as compared with children with chronic liver disease. Transplanted children with asthma had higher rates of sensitization to food allergens than those without asthma (RR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.3-10.3; P = .01). The most frequent food allergens associated with asthma in transplanted children were milk (RR for asthma, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.6-9.4; P < .01), eggs (RR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.2-7.0; P = .03), and peanuts (RR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.6-8.3; P < .01). Food allergies occurred earlier than asthma, at 1.5 years after transplantation (IQR, 0.5-3.0 years) vs 2.5 years after transplantation (IQR, 1.0-4.5 years; P < .05). Food allergies were also associated with eczema, but not with sensitization to aero-allergens or rhinitis., CONCLUSIONS: The high risk of food allergies in children who were liver transplant recipients was associated with eczema and asthma, but not rhinitis. The most frequent food allergens associated with asthma were milk, eggs, and peanuts. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The project Seoul Atopy . Asthma-friendly School investigated the current status of childhood asthma to enable formulation of a preventative policy. We evaluated the current prevalence of childhood asthma in Seoul and its trends and related factors., METHODS: The project was conducted annually from 2011 to 2016 and involved around 35 000 children aged 1-13 years. Based on the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood guidelines, the survey involved parents. The associations of the particulate matter (PM10) concentration, and the number of days on which the daily air quality guidance level was exceeded in the 25 districts of Seoul, with the prevalence of asthma were assessed., RESULTS: The age-standardized asthma prevalence in 2011 and 2016 was 6.74 and 4.02%, respectively. The prevalence of lifetime asthma treatment and treatment during the last 12 months tended to decrease from 2011 to 2016. Asthma treatment was significantly correlated with the number of days on which the daily air quality guidance level was exceeded, but not with the PM10 concentration., CONCLUSIONS: This study reports the prevalence of asthma among children in Seoul and confirmed the relationship between childhood asthma and known risk factors in a large-scale survey.

N2  - The prevalence of the asthmatic symptoms among children increases globally over the time. Reduced exposure to pathogens in early childhood and increased exposure to anthropogenic irritants result in increased risk of wheezing in children, and all of this may be related to the usage of household chemicals. Objective of this analysis thus was to study the potential effects of overall exposure to home chemicals in the early life on the phenotypes of wheezing from birth until five years of age. 3411 mother-infant pairs from the Czech part of the European Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ELSPAC-CZ) participated in the study. The exposure was estimated by the composite household chemical score from 18 chemical-based products. Social, medical and environmental factors were taken into account as covariates in multivariable multinomial logistic regression using phenotypes of wheezing as a study outcome. We were able to determine the association between several wheezing childhood phenotypes and the frequent usage of household chemicals in the fully adjusted model. Statistically significant odds ratios (OR) for increasing exposures per 1 SD of exposure score were obtained for the intermediate onset transient (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.10-1.47), intermediated onset persistent (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.03-1.46), and early onset persistent phenotypes (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.04-1.77) in comparison to never wheezing children. Moreover, the persistent phenotypes were significantly associated with school age asthma. Our study has shown the negative role of the increased household chemicals usage on the respiratory outcomes in children up to five years of age. Overall evaluation of the household chemical exposure may be useful tool for any large epidemiological studies. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Numerous risk factors have been characterized for acquired subglottic stenosis (ASGS) in the pediatric population. This analysis explores the comorbidities of hospitalized ASGS patients in the United States and associated costs and length of stay (LOS)., METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) from 2009 to 2012 for inpatients<=20 years of age who were diagnosed with ASGS. International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification, Version 9 diagnosis codes were used to extract diagnoses of interest from 14, 045, 425 weighted discharges across 4179 hospitals in the United States. An algorithm was created to identify the most common co-diagnoses and subsequently evaluated for total charges and LOS., RESULTS: ASGS was found in 7981 (0.06%) of total discharges. The mean LOS in discharges with ASGS is 13.11 days while the mean total charge in discharges with ASGS is $114,625; these values are significantly greater in discharges with ASGS than discharges without ASGS. Patients with ASGS have greater odds of being co-diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux, Trisomy 21, other upper airway anomalies and asthma, while they have lower odds of being diagnosed with prematurity and dehydration. Aside from Trisomy 21 and asthma, hospitalizations of ASGS patients with the aforementioned comorbidities incurred a greater LOS and mean total charge., CONCLUSION: Our analysis identifies numerous comorbidities in children with ASGS that are associated with increased resource utilization amongst US hospitalizations. The practicing otolaryngologist should continue to advocate interdisciplinary care and be aware of the need for future controlled studies that investigate the management of such comorbidities.

N2  - The influence of early life exposures on later life disease has for some time provided clues to modifiable risk factors of disease. The &ldquo;atopic march&rdquo; is thought to play a role in the progression of allergic diseases and may offer an opportunity to lower asthma&rsquo;s health and socioeconomic burden, although evidence remains controversial. We aimed to examine the relationship between early life eczema and asthma later in life. Using the National Child Development Study, we examined infant eczema and childhood and adult asthma. Data related to asthma or wheezing bronchitis were available for 13,503 (73%; 95% CI 72-74), 11,503 (61%; 95% CI 60-61), 12,524 (68%; 95% CI 67-69), 11,194 (60%; 95% CI 60-60), 9377 (51%; 95% CI 51-51), and 9760 (53%; 95% CI 52-53) subjects at ages 11, 16, 23, 33, 44, and 50 years, respectively. Logistic regression models were fitted to examine each wave separately before and after adjusting for a range of potential confounders. Generalised estimating equation (GEE) methods were undertaken to examine the associations after pooling all data from questionnaires. The prevalence of self-reported asthma in those that had previously reported infant eczema ranged from 1.0%; 95% CI 0.9-1.4 (age 44 years) to 2.2%; 95% CI 2.1-2.3 (age 33 years). Participants with infant eczema had a 2-3-fold increased risk of reporting asthma in childhood and adulthood; this was 1.6 times at age 44 years when using spirometry measures. Similar effect sizes were observed in the GEE models when considering all participants (OR 2.9; 95% CI 2.6-3.2). Childhood and adult asthma were consistently associated with infant eczema both by using the self-reported data and lung measures.

N2  - Objective: To identify risk factors which may lead to the occurrence of recurrent wheezing in children under five years of age., Material and Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted in children under 5 years old at the Out Patient Department at Naresuan University Hospital, from October 2013 to October 2014. Fifty-five children who had signs and symptoms of recurrent wheezing were assigned to the study group, whereas another fifty-five children matching on age and sex with the case who had no symptoms of recurrent wheezing were assigned to the control group. All of the parents completed the given questionnaires. Descriptive data analysis were statistically conducted to understand the characteristics of the study groups. The risk factors were analysed using both bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses which included all the important predictors with a statistically significant level of p<0.05., Results: Mean age in the study group was 36.1 months and in the control group 25.0 months. The mean weights and heights showed no difference between the case and control groups. Bivariate analysis showed that upper respiratory tract infection [odds ratio (OR) 7.273; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.277-23.232)], lower respiratory tract infection (OR 5.332; 95% CI 2.326-12.225), passive smoking (OR 2.368; 95% CI 1.094-5.129), and day care center attendance (OR 2.590; 95% CI 1.168-5.745) were the risk factors of recurrent wheezing. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicate that lower respiratory tract infection [adjusted odds ratios (aOR) 0.241; 95% CI 0.088-0.659] was the most important risk factor leading to recurrent wheezing., Conclusion: Lower respiratory tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, passive smoking and day care center attendance were found to be risk factors of recurrent wheezing in children under five years of age, with lower respiratory tract infection being the most risk. Targeted surveillance of these risk factors should reduce the incidence of recurrent wheezing. This is especially important for high risk patients such as asthma patients.

T1  - Day-care center attendance and risk of Asthma-A systematic review.
A1  - Ochoa Sangrador, Carlos

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Asthma and other wheezing disorders are common chronic health problems in childhood. We aim to evaluate whether the attendance by children under three years of age to day-care centers is a protector or risk factor in the development of recurrent wheezing or asthma in the following years of their lives., METHODS: Systematic review of published cohort or cross-sectional studies, without any time limitation. We searched in PubMed, Cinhal, Cuiden and Scopus (EMBASE included). The quality of the studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Disagreements were solved by mutual consensus. Weighted odds ratio (ORs) were estimated using RevMan 5.3, following random effects models., RESULTS: We selected 18 studies for qualitative analysis, nine cohort studies and nine cross-sectional studies. Day-care center attendance is associated with an increased risk of early recurrent wheezing (four studies; 50,619 subjects; adjusted OR 1.87 [1.21 to 2.88]; I2 91%) and asthma before the age of six (five studies; 5412 subjects; adjusted OR 1.59 [1.26 to 2.01]; I2 0%), but not later (five studies; 5538 subjects; adjusted OR 0.86 [0.55 to 1.32]; I2 76%)., CONCLUSIONS: Children attending day-care center during the first years of life have a higher risk of recurrent wheezing during the first three years and asthma before the age of six, but not later. This risk must be taken into account to inform parents in order to choose what kind of care children should have throughout infancy and to implement preventive measures to reduce its impact.

T1  - Health and educational implications of prematurity in the United States: National Survey of Children's Health 2011/2012 data.
A1  - Kelly, Michelle M
Y1  - 2018//
N2  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Preterm birth is a significant public health issue, with children born prematurely experiencing educational and health difficulties throughout childhood. The aim of the descriptive secondary data analysis was to compare health implications and educational experiences in children born prematurely compared with children born at term., METHODS: The 2011/2012 National Survey of Children's Health data set was explored using separate chi-square tests of homogeneity to investigate differences in the occurrence of chronic health conditions and educationally relevant outcomes: individualized family services plan/individualized education plan (IFSP/IEP), and grade repetition between children born prematurely compared with those born at term., CONCLUSIONS: The six most frequently occurring chronic health conditions that disproportionally affected children born prematurely include the following: attention deficit disorder/attention deficit hyperactive disorder (odds ratio [OR], 1.59), anxiety (OR, 1.63), asthma (OR, 1.7), learning disability (OR, 2.07), speech problems (OR, 2.27), and developmental delay (OR, 3.17). Preterm birth negatively affects the educational experience of CBP as measured by increased report of IFSP/IEP and repeated grades across all age categories., IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: All health care providers have an important role in preventing preterm birth and in supporting the children and families affected by preterm birth. Appreciation of the incidence and prevalence of the health conditions and educational difficulties associated with preterm birth is essential for facilitating access to appropriate resources. Beyond patient interactions, these modifiable yet additive factors should inform health policy and planning.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to identify developmental trajectories of wheezing using data-driven methodology, and to examine whether trajectory membership differentially impacts the effectiveness of primary preventive efforts that target modifiable asthma risk factors., METHODS: Secondary analysis of the Canadian Asthma Primary Prevention Study (CAPPS), a multifaceted prenatal intervention among children at high risk of asthma, followed from birth to 15 years. Wheezing trajectories were identified by latent class growth analysis. Predictors, intervention effects, and asthma diagnoses were examined between and within trajectory groups., RESULTS: Among 525 children, 3 wheeze trajectory groups were identified: Low-Progressive (365, 69%), Early-Transient (52, 10%), and Early-Persistent (108, 21%). The study intervention was associated with lower odds of Early-Transient and Early-Persistent wheezing (P < .01). Other predictors of wheeze trajectories included, maternal asthma, maternal education, city of residence, breastfeeding, household pets, infant sex and atopy at 12 months. The odds of an asthma diagnosis were three-fold to six-fold higher in the Early-Persistent vs Low-Progressive group at all follow-up assessments (P = .03), whereas Early-Transient wheezing (limited to the first year) was not associated with asthma. In the Early-Persistent group, the odds of wheezing were lower among intervention than control children (adjusted odds ratio: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.48; 0.93) at 7 years., CONCLUSIONS: Using data-driven methodology, children can be classified into clinically meaningful wheeze trajectory groups that appear to be programmed by modifiable and non-modifiable factors, and are useful for predicting asthma risk. Early-life interventions can alter some wheeze trajectories (ie, Early-Persistent) in infancy and reduce wheezing prevalence in mid-childhood. Copyright © 2018 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Exploring patterns of childhood wheeze may help to clarify the etiology and prognosis of respiratory diseases. The purpose of this study was to classify phenotypes of wheezing in children up to 9 years of age in Japan and to evaluate the individual and environmental risk factors for these phenotypes., METHODS: Wheeze was evaluated at approximately 1-year intervals based on the mothers' recollection of their child's wheezing or whistling in the chest during the preceding 12 months. The children were aged 1-9 years. In total, 1116 children who had at least five measures of wheezing at all nine time points were used for identifying trajectories. Trajectories were identified with group-based trajectory analysis. A multinomial logit model was built to evaluate the relationships between phenotypes and risk factors., RESULTS: Five typical trajectories were identified. The probability of group membership was 43.7%, 32.2%, 6.2%, 8.6%, and 9.2% for the never/infrequent wheeze, transient early wheeze, school-age-onset wheeze, early-childhood-onset remitting wheeze, and persistent wheeze trajectories, respectively. Infant tobacco exposure increased the odds of membership in the transient early wheeze trajectory compared to the never/infrequent wheeze trajectory., CONCLUSIONS: Using the group-based trajectory modeling approach, we identified five trajectories of childhood wheeze development in a Japanese population. The trajectories shown here are based on formal statistical modeling rather than on subjective classification, and an assessment of its precision suggested that the model has high assignment accuracy.

N2  - Children with atopic dermatitis (AD) usually develop symptoms when they reach the age of 6-7 years, but the risk of developing respiratory allergies, asthma and allergic rhinitis (AR) remains high. In most children with AD, the development of asthma and AR is associated with sensitization to food allergens and/or aeroallergens, while only a small percentage missed atopic diathesis. In about 35% of children with AD, food allergy is the provoking cause, and 60% of infants who had AD in the first 3 months of life were sensitized against aeroallergens by the age of 5. The aim of the study was to follow development of asthma and AR and to assess the most significant risk factors for developing respiratory allergy. A total of 114 children with AD were followed up for five years. At annual visits, the severity of disease, total immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody values, skin prick tests, specific IgE antibodies to food allergens and aeroallergens, and absolute eosinophil count were assessed. Information on the family history of atopy and AD, feeding patterns during infancy, data on sensitivity to food allergens and/or aeroallergens, and on the occurrence of bronchial obstruction and nose symptoms were obtained. Asthma developed in 36 children, median age 7.7 years; 33 children had symptoms of AR, and 13 children with AD had both diseases associated; 38 children had sensitivity to food, of which 24 developed asthma and 13 AR; asthma developed in 18/23 children with sensitivity to aeroallergens, and almost an equal number of children developed AR. The increased absolute eosinophil count and specific IgE to aeroallergens and food allergens were the best asthma predictors, while AR predictors were family history and early onset of AD. In conclusion, children with AD are at a significant risk of developing respiratory allergies, and those with the increased absolute eosinophil count, positive specific IgE to aeroallergens and food allergens, heredity of AD, and early onset of AD are at the highest risk. Identification of risk factors will enable us to improve the treatments of AD in order to reduce the severity of disease and prevent manifestation of respiratory allergy.

N2  - BACKGROUND: General practice-based (GP) healthcare data have promise, when systematically collected, to support estimating local rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, variations in burden of disease, risk factors and comorbid conditions, and disease management and quality of care. The use of GP information systems for health improvement has been limited, however, in the scope and quality of data. This study assessed the practical utility of de-identified clinical databases for estimating local rates of COPD and asthma. We compared COPD and asthma rates to national benchmarks, examined health related risk factors and co-morbidities as correlates of COPD and asthma, and assessed spatial patterns in prevalence estimates at the small-area level., METHODS: Data were extracted from five GP databases in western Adelaide, South Australia, for active patients residing in the region between 2012 and 2014. Prevalence estimates were computed at the statistical area 1 (SA1) spatial unit level using the empirical Bayes estimation approach. Descriptive analyses included summary statistics, spatial indices and mapping of geographic patterns. Bivariate associations were assessed, and disease profiles investigated to ascertain multi-morbidities. Multilevel logistic regression models were fitted, accounting for individual covariates including the number of comorbid conditions to assess the influence of area-level socio-economic status (SES)., RESULTS: For 33,725 active patients, prevalence estimates were 3.4% for COPD and 10.3% for asthma, 0.8% higher and 0.5% lower for COPD and asthma, respectively, against 2014-15 National Health Survey (NHS) benchmarks. Age-specific comparisons showed discrepancies for COPD in the '64 years or less' and 'age 65 and up' age groups, and for asthma in the '15-25 years' and '75 years and up' age groups. Analyses confirmed associations with individual-level factors, co-morbid conditions, and area-level SES. Geographic aggregation was seen for COPD and asthma, with clustering around GP clinics and health care centres. Spatial patterns were inversely related to area-level SES., CONCLUSION: GP-based data capture and analysis has a clear potential to support research for improved patient outcomes for COPD and asthma via knowledge of geographic variability and its correlates, and how local prevalence estimates differ from NHS benchmarks for vulnerable age-groups.

N2  - Ambient air pollution is a well-known risk factor of various asthma-related outcomes, however, past research has often focused on acute exacerbations rather than asthma development. This study draws on a population-based, multigenerational panel dataset from the United States to assess the association of childhood asthma risk with census block-level, annual-average air pollution exposure measured during the prenatal and early postnatal periods, as well as effect modification by neighborhood poverty. Findings suggest that early-life exposures to nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a marker of traffic-related pollution, and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), a mixture of industrial and other pollutants, are positively associated with subsequent childhood asthma diagnosis (OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.10-1.41 and OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.06-1.46, respectively, per interquartile range (IQR) increase in each pollutant (NO2 IQR = 8.51 ppb and PM2.5 IQR = 4.43 micro /m3)). These effects are modified by early-life neighborhood poverty exposure, with no or weaker effects in moderate- and low- (versus high-) poverty areas. This work underscores the importance of a holistic, developmental approach to elucidating the interplay of social and environmental contexts that may create conditions for racial-ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in childhood asthma risk.

N2  - Primary care clinicians have a central role in managing influenza/influenza-like illness (ILI) during influenza pandemics. This study identifies risk factors for influenza-related complications in children presenting with influenza/ILI in primary care. We conducted a cohort study using routinely collected linked data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink on children aged 17 years and younger who presented with influenza/ILI during the 2009/10 pandemic. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) for potential risk factors in relation to influenza-related complications, complications requiring intervention, pneumonia, all-cause hospitalisation and hospitalisation due to influenza-related complications within 30 days of presentation. Analyses were adjusted for potential confounders including age, vaccination and socio-economic deprivation. Asthma was a risk factor for influenza-related complications (adjusted OR 1.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21-1.80, P < 0.001), complications requiring intervention (adjusted OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.11-1.88; P = 0.007), pneumonia (adjusted OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.07-2.51, P = 0.024) and hospitalisation due to influenza-related complications (adjusted OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.09-5.56, P = 0.031). Neurological conditions were risk factors for all-cause hospitalisation (adjusted OR 4.25, 95% CI 1.50-12.07, P = 0.007) but not influenza-related complications (adjusted OR 1.46, 95% CI 0.83-2.56, P = 0.189). Community-based early interventions to prevent influenza-related clinical deterioration should therefore be primarily targeted at children with asthma and neurological conditions.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Preterm birth is associated with increased risk of respiratory symptoms in childhood, often treated with asthma medication. We designed a follow-up study to previous research and investigated whether the association of gestational age with purchasing asthma medication diminishes in adulthood., METHODS: We conducted a register-based study of a national cohort of all infants born in Denmark in 1980-2009 evaluating longitudinal data on individually prescribed asthma medication (both inhaled s-2 receptor agonist and different controller treatment over 2-year periods) available from 1995-2011. We analyzed the effect of gestational age considering age, birth year, and perinatal variables using logistic regression with a Generalized Estimating Equations model. All data were unambiguously linked through the Civil Registration System., RESULTS: We included 1,819,743 individuals in our study population. We found an inverse dose-response relationship between gestational age and asthma medication in earlier age-groups with a gradual decrease in odds ratios with increasing age and loss of statistical significance in early adulthood (18-31 years). For our oldest generations, there was a significant effect of gestational age (p-value = 0.04), which became insignificant when adjusting for confounding and mediating factors (p = 0.44). There were significant interactions between gestational age and age (p<0.0001) and gestational age and birth year, but these were most important during childhood (0-11 years) and for our youngest generations (born after 1995)., CONCLUSION: The strong association between gestational age and purchase of prescription asthma medication weakens with age into early adulthood, in consistence with the results from our previous study. The risk for purchasing medication to treat asthma-like symptoms was higher in more recent birth years, but the effect of gestational age was small beyond 11 years of age. Gestational age per se did not seem to be significant for the development of asthma-like symptoms: most of its effect could be explained by other perinatal factors.

N2  - Few studies have assessed the lagged effects of levels of different urban city air pollutants and seasons on asthma hospitalization in children. This study used big data analysis to explore the effects of daily changes in air pollution and season on childhood asthma hospitalization from 2001 to 2010 in Taipei and Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. A time-stratified case-crossover study and conditional logistic regression analysis were employed to identify associations between the risk of hospitalization due to asthma in children and the levels of air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, O3, SO2, and NO2) in the days preceding hospitalization. During the study period, 2900 children in Taipei and 1337 in Kaohsiung aged <=15 years were hospitalized due to asthma for the first time. The results indicated that the levels of air pollutants were significantly associated with the risk of asthma hospitalization in children, and seasonal effects were observed. High levels of air pollution in Kaohsiung had greater effects than in Taipei after adjusting for seasonal variation. The most important factor was O3 in spring in Taipei. In children aged 0-6 years, asthma was associated with O3 in Taipei and SO2 in Kaohsiung, after controlling for the daily mean temperature and relative humidity.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the characteristics of a general asthma population; most have focused on more severe patients or severe exacerbations., METHODS: This population-based cohort study, from April 2007 to September 2015, used linked primary and secondary care electronic healthcare records (Clinical Practice Research Datalink, Hospital Episode Statistics). Characteristics of four age cohorts, 'Under 5s', '5 to 17s', '18 to 54s', '55+', were described. Exacerbation risk factors, including asthma severity (measured by the British Thoracic Society (BTS) stepwise approach), were assessed using Poisson regression., RESULTS: 424 326 patients with current asthma were eligible (n, median follow-up: 'Under 5s'=17 320, 1 year; '5 to 17s'=82 707, 3.3 years; '18 to 54s'=210 724, 4 years; '55+'=113 575, 5.1 years). Over 60% of the total study population had mild asthma (BTS steps 1/2). There were differences between the cohort's characteristics, including by gender, disease severity and exacerbation pattern. The rate of exacerbations was highest in the oldest cohort and lowest in the '5 to 17s' cohort (rate per 10 person-years (95% CI), 'Under 5s'=4.27 (4.18 to 4.38), '5 to 17s'=1.48 (1.47 to 1.50), '18 to 54s'=3.22 (3.21 to 3.24), '55+'=9.40 (9.37 to 9.42)). In all cohorts, exacerbation rates increased with increasing asthma severity, after adjusting for confounders including gender, socioeconomic status, smoking, body mass index, atopy, rhinitis, gastro-oesophageal reflux, anxiety, depression and COPD., CONCLUSION: The majority of UK patients with asthma had mild asthma and did not experience an exacerbation during follow-up. Patients aged >=55 years had the lowest proportion with mild asthma and highest rate of exacerbations; the opposite was found in patients aged between 5 and 18 years.

N2  - This study aims to find out the relationship between pet keeping in childhood and asthma and allergy among children aged 0-8 years old in Tianjin, China. Parental or guardians reports of 7360 children were analyzed. 1490 (21.6%) families kept pets at the time of the survey (current), among them 4.0% cats, and 14.7% dogs. For the first year of life of children (early), 1196 (18.4%) families kept pets, and among them 3.2% cats, and 13.7% dogs. Exposure to a pet in early childhood significantly increased the risk of current wheeze, current dry cough, and diagnosed rhinitis. 17.9% of parents reported an avoidance behavior, i.e., had removed or refrained a pet due to asthma or allergy in the family. After adjustment for avoidance behavior, the negative effect of pet keeping on children's health became even more obvious, with e.g. an AOR of 3.37 (1.58-7.19) for diagnosed asthma, 3.60 (2.07-6.27) for diagnosed rhinitis, 1.92 (1.31-2.81) for diagnosed eczema. A dose-response relationship between pet keeping at current and current wheeze, current eczema and diagnosed eczema was found. In conclusion, pet exposure in early life of children in Tianjin is a risk factor for asthma and allergies among children aged 0-8 years old.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency in children 0-18 years of age with recurrent wheezing and/or asthma residing in the microregion of Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil, and treated at a referral center, and to determine its association with major risk factors for wheezing., METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed using a semi-structured questionnaire, which was administered by trained interviewers to the legal guardians of the study participants. Data were obtained regarding general characteristics of recurrent wheezing; general sociodemographic, environmental, and biologic factors; and atopy-related factors. The magnitude of the statistical association was assessed by calculating ORs and their corresponding 95% CIs by using multiple logistic regression., RESULTS: We included 124 children in the study. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency in the sample was 57.3%. Vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency was found to be associated with wheezing in the first year of life, personal history of atopic dermatitis, environmental pollution, and vitamin D supplementation until 2 years of age., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency was high in our sample. Vitamin D concentrations were directly associated with vitamin D supplementation until 2 years of age and were inversely associated with wheezing events in the first year of life, personal history of atopic dermatitis, and environmental pollution.

N2  - BACKGROUND: We sought to identify predictors of asthma development following severe early childhood RSV bronchiolitis. Different definitions of asthma were also compared., METHODS: This longitudinal, observational study (N = 343) followed patients (<2 years old) from a placebo-controlled trial (N = 979) of montelukast after RSV bronchiolitis to identify clinical, demographic, or biochemical predictors of asthma, atopic disorders, and chronic asthma therapy use at 6 years of age (Clinical Trials Registry Number: NCT01140048). Asthma (primary definition) was based on parental identification of wheeze at 6 AND 12 months before 6 years of age; definitions based on physician diagnosis as well as parental identification of wheeze at 6 OR 12 months (to consider seasonal effect) were also assessed. Post-hoc analyses evaluated agreement among asthma diagnosis criteria., RESULTS: Prevalence of asthma (primary definition by parental identification), asthma (physician diagnosis), atopic disorders, and chronic asthma therapy use (parental identification) was 6.1%, 22.4%, 36.2%, and 14.5%, respectively. Predictors for asthma (primary definition) included male gender, a relative with asthma, and RAST positive for dog dander; for physician diagnosis of asthma, high severity score for RSV bronchiolitis, high respiratory rate, and asthma diagnosis before enrollment. Predictors of atopic disorders included allergic rhinitis before enrollment, a relative with asthma, and the plasma biomarkers IL-5, IL-16, and IL-18. Predictors of chronic asthma therapy use included asthma diagnosis before enrollment and geographic region (Europe and Africa). Only 42% of patients with asthma (primary definition) also met the asthma definition by physician diagnosis and chronic asthma therapy use., CONCLUSION: Among children with early RSV bronchiolitis, hereditary factors (i.e., having a relative with asthma) and RSV bronchiolitis severity were predictors of asthma and atopic disorders at 6 years of age. Of interest, there was poor agreement among the asthma definitions evaluated. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2016;51:1382-1392. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Copyright © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - An analysis of a prospective cohort of individuals with sickle cell anemia (SCA), enrolled from birth through adulthood, was conducted to determine if asthma is a risk factor for death in SCA. All-cause mortality was determined for participants after adjusting for known risk factors for death in SCA. The study included 1,963 individuals who were followed for 18,495 patient-years. After controlling for established risk factors, individuals with SCA and asthma had a more than two-fold higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio 2.36, 95% CI 1.21 to 4.62, p=0.01). To summarize, asthma is a risk factor for death in SCA.

N2  - Despite long-term studies, still not much is known about the asthma triggering factors and its sometimes controversial results. Probably one of the major problems of controversy is the lack of specific and accurate diagnosis of this disease. The aim of this study was to assess lung function, atopy, and environmental factors in spirometry-diagnosed asthmatic patients. Time series of daily counts of hospital emergency admissions were constructed for known asthmatic subjects. Spirometry, chest radiograph, arterial gasometry, skin tests, environmental SO2 levels, and climatic parameters were evaluated. Family asthma history was observed in a high proportion of asthmatic patients and it correlated marginally with severity of asthma. A seasonal trend in asthma frequency was recorded and it was more common in the urban area and in those living in the margins of the city. The most frequent asthma type recorded was the severe persistent asthma. More than 50% of subjects had subresponse to bronchodilator; asthma paradox was recorded in 10.8%. Positive skin tests were observed in 36.9% and SO2 levels did not correlate with asthma attacks. Paradox asthma or tolerance may be developed by asthmatic subjects during chronic treatment with short-acting 92-agonists. To avoid side effects and to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with the usage of antiasthma medications, it is essential to identify quickly those subjects that respond abnormally to the short-acting P2-agonist.

N2  - Childhood recurrent wheezing is a very prevalent heterogeneous clinical entity. An 8-year prospective study was performed to correlate the clinical outcome of recurrent wheezing in the first years of life with prognostic risk factors. A cohort of 308 children with recurrent wheezing, aged <7 years, were enrolled in 1993, studied using a questionnaire, skin-prick tests, and serum total IgE. According to the study protocol, in 1996 and 2001, the cohort was assessed. In 2001, 81% of the initial sample was reevaluated (n=249); 61% remained symptomatic. Prevalence of atopy was 48% in 1993, 65% in 1996, and 75% in 2001. By logistic regression analysis, we identified the following as independent risk factors for asthma symptoms in the last year of the follow-up: personal history of rhinitis (odds ratio [OR] = 15.8, 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.1-40.8; p < 0.001), paternal asthma (OR =, 7.2; 95% CI = 1.7-29.7; p = 0.007), personal history of atopic dermatitis (OR = 5.9, 95% CI = 2.2-15.7; p < 0.001), maternal asthma (OR = 5.4, 95% CI = 1.7-17.1; p = 0.004), allergen sensitization (OR = 3.4, 95% CI = 1.2-10.4; p = 0.03), and onset of symptoms in the 2nd year or later in preschool-aged children (OR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.1-4.8; p = 0.04). Kindergarten attendance before 12 months was identified as a protective factor (OR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.2-0.9; p = 0.04). Among the 128 nonatopic children in 1993, 52% developed allergen sensitization. We identified as prognostic risk factors for asthma symptoms personal history of allergic disease, parental asthma, atopy, and late onset of symptoms. In a significant number of children clinical symptoms can occur years before allergen sensitization.

N2  - Although eosinophilia in wheezing infants predicts subsequent wheezing, it is not known how long the association persists. Our aim was to evaluate the connection between blood eosinophilia in infancy and later wheezing/asthma until adulthood, with special attention paid to infection-induced changes in blood eosinophils. We have prospectively followed up 83 infants until adulthood after hospitalization for bronchiolitis in 1981-1982. Blood eosinophils were determined in a counting chamber on admission and on convalescence 4-6 weeks later. Data on recurrent wheezing and asthma were registered prospectively at five follow-ups until the age of 18-20 years. The median (25th-75th percentile) eosinophil count was 0.100 x 10E9/L (0.028-0.321) on admission and 0.231 x 10E9/L (0.119-0.368) on convalescence. Eosinophils during bronchiolitis or infection-induced changes in eosinophils were not associated with subsequent wheezing/asthma at any age during the follow-up. The result was similar in univariate and multivariate analyses. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis patients had lower eosinophils on admission than non-RSV cases, but the changes induced by RSV or other infection did not differ significantly. In univariate analyses, elevated eosinophils on convalescence predicted later wheezing until 3-4 years of age. In multivariate analysis, adjusted for RSV etiology, age on admission, and histories of earlier wheezing and atopy, elevated eosinophils on convalescence predicted increased asthma risk at 2-3 years (OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.29-3.95), at 3-4 years (OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.27-3.95), and at 8.5-10 years (OR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.01-4.64). Eosinophilia outside, but not during, infection predicted recurrent wheezing until preschool and early school years but not thereafter.

N2  - A knowledge of the natural history of asthma in first years of life is necessary to establish preventive and therapeutic plans. The aim of this study was to overview the clinical evidence about the natural history of asthma in different pediatric ages, with emphasis on risk factors and prediction indexes. We used the data source PubMed, using a search algorithm selecting for natural history studies of asthma and respiratory allergy in all children to August 2005. A few studies prospectively assessed the natural history of asthma from infancy to childhood to adulthood to mature age. Some risk factors from these studies can be translated into prognostic indexes. The accuracy of such indexes seems skewed toward screening rather than diagnostic ability. Natural history is the basis on which accurate predictors of the persistence of wheezing and asthma can be predicated. In the absence of genetic markers, parental history of asthma, personal history of eczema, and immunologic tests such as serum IgE, peripheral eosinophilia, and serum eosinophilic cationic protein are the better indicators of the development of asthma in infants.

N2  - Sales of inhaled beta2-agonist bronchodilators may be related to the increase in asthma deaths. The aim of this study is to find whether prescribed drug therapy was associated with the increased risk of death from asthma and life-threatening attacks (LTA). The "case" group comprised those under 35 years of age who expired or experienced LTA from January 1994 through December 1996. For each case, an age and sex matched control was selected from asthma patients. Hospital records were reviewed to obtain information on the prescribed drug therapy and clinical asthma severity for the cases and controls. Bivariate analysis with conditional logistic regression models for matched data sets were used to estimate the severity-adjusted odds ratios for each asthma medication. Twenty-four fatal cases and 54 LTA cases were observed. The crude odds ratio of clinical severity (OR=9.33, 95%CI:2.84-30.7) was larger than unity and with statistical significance. After adjusting for clinical severity, the odds ratios computed for all beta2-agonists delivered by metered dose inhaler (MDI) increased (OR=2.08, 95%CI:0.78-5.50) from that of crude analysis. Among those subjects under 20 years of age, the clinical severity-adjusted odds ratio for the use of all beta2-agonists by MDI (OR=3.67, 95%CI:0.77-17.5) was higher than that of all subjects. The prescription of B2-agonists by MDI increased the risk of asthma death after taking clinical severity into account. Although not statistically significant, our results suggested that beta2-agonists administered by a MDI might have increased the risk of asthma death and LTA in Japan because the magnitude of the effect was similar to that reported in other countries.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of asthma and risk factors associated in children and adolescents., METHODS: Population-based cross-sectional study with 1,185 female and male children and adolescents carried out in the city of Sao Paulo, Southeastern Brazil, from 2008 to 2009. Data were collected through home interviews. Respondents were selected from two-stage (census tract, household) cluster random sampling stratified by gender and age. Multiple Poisson regression was used in the adjusted analysis between the outcome and socioeconomic, demographic, lifestyle and health condition variables., RESULTS: Of all respondents, 9.1% (95%CI 7.0;11.7) reported asthma. After adjustment, the following variables were found independently associated with asthma: age (0 to 4 years vs. 15 to 19) (PR 3.18, 95%CI 1.20;8.42); age (5 to 9 years vs. 15 to 19) (PR 6.37, 95%CI 2.64;15.39); age (10 to 14 years vs. 15 to 19) (PR 4.51, 95%CI 1.95;10.40); allergy (yes vs. no) (PR 2.22, 95%CI 1.24;4.00); rhinitis (yes vs. no) (PR 2.13, 95%CI 1.22;3.73); health conditions in the 15 days preceding the interview (yes vs. no) (PR 1.96, 95%CI 1.23;3.11); number of rooms in the household (1 to 3 vs. 4 and more) (PR 1.67, 95%CI 1.05;2.66); and skin color (black and mixed vs. white) (PR 2.00, 95%CI 1.14;3.49)., CONCLUSIONS: This study showed the importance of factors associated with asthma including rhinitis and allergy; age between 5 to 9 years old; black and mixed skin color; and household with few rooms. Frequent health problems are seen as a common consequence of asthma.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the role of environmental and hereditary factors in determining whether persistent childhood wheezing phenotypes had an early or late onset., METHODS: In a whole population birth cohort (n = 1456), children were seen at birth and at 1, 2, 4, and 10 years. At each visit, information was collected prospectively regarding wheeze prevalence and used to classify subjects into wheezing phenotypes. Information on genetic and environmental risk factors in early life was also obtained prospectively, and skin-prick testing to common allergens was performed at 4 years., RESULTS: Early-onset persistent wheezers (n = 125) had wheeze onset in the first 4 years, still present at age 10, whereas late-onset persistent wheezers (n = 81) had wheeze onset after age 4 years that was still present at 10 years. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified independent significance only for inherited factors (parental asthma, family history of rhinitis, eczema at 4 years, and atopic status at 4 years) in the development of late-onset persistent wheeze. However, low social class at birth, recurrent chest infections at 2 years, and parental smoking at 2 years plus inherited factors (eczema at 2 years; food allergy at 4 years; maternal asthma, sibling asthma, maternal urticaria, and atopic status at 4 years) demonstrated independent significance for early-onset persistent wheeze., CONCLUSION: Inheritance seems to be of prime significance in the cause of persistent childhood wheeze. Environmental exposure in early life may combine with this tendency to produce an early onset of persistent wheeze. Absence of these environmental factors might delay but not prevent the onset of wheeze in children with atopic heredity.

N2  - Since new vaccines and anti-viral drugs for influenza have become available, collation of actual and country-specific epidemiological data is essential. Since respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a well known paediatric airway pathogen and some epidemiological data exist already, a comparison between influenza and RSV seems warranted. From July 1996 to June 2001 the naso-pharyngeal aspirates (NPA) of children from birth to 16 years of age, admitted to one of the two paediatric hospitals in Kiel, Germany, were investigated by a nine-valent multiplex reverse transcriptase PCR assay. NPA were investigated in 60.8 % of 3,469 children admitted with an acute respiratory tract infection. Community-acquired or nosocomial infections (in parentheses) due to influenza A were diagnosed in 122 (10) children, due to influenza B in 14 (2) and due to RSV in 325 (24) cases. Patients with influenza A (median 752 days) and influenza B (median 966 days) were older than patients with RSV (median 168 days). The spectrum of disease presentation was broader in influenza than in RSV. In each winter, admissions with influenza were less common than those with RSV. Influenza B only occurred in 2 of the 5 years. The cumulative, population-based incidences per 100,000 children 0-16 (0-5, >5-16) years of age were 53 (123, 22) for influenza A, 16 (30, 9) for influenza B and 165 (453, 4) for RSV. Cardiac conditions and asthma were the major risk factors for admission to hospital with influenza A (RR 9.8, 4.1) and RSV (8.5, 2.1) infections. Underlying conditions were most common in influenza B. Low gestational age doubled the risk for admission to hospital with influenza A infection, but did not show a dose-effect relationship as in RSV. The burden of influenza-positive hospitalizations was about one third that of RSV. The incidence was similar to reports from the United States. Targeting children with underlying conditions, especially cardiac conditions and asthma in the German immunization programme is appropriate, as long as no policy for vaccination of the general paediatric population exists.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: In a prospective study of children with a family history of asthma, asthma onset by 3 years of age was found previously to be positively associated with variables from the first year of life, including elevated total immunoglobulin E (IgE), frequent respiratory infections, and parenting difficulties. We followed this cohort of genetically at-risk children to investigate the relationship between factors assessed in infancy and asthma, allergy, and psychological status at school age., METHODS: A cohort of 150 children who were at risk for developing asthma were identified prenatally on the basis of the mothers' having asthma. For 28 children, the father had asthma as well, putting them at bilateral genetic risk. Families primarily were middle and upper middle class Caucasians. Parents came to the clinic during the third trimester of pregnancy for assessments of medical and psychosocial functioning. A home visit took place when the infant was 3 weeks old, when parenting risk was assessed before the onset of any asthma symptoms. Parenting difficulties included problems with infant caregiving as well as components of maternal functioning, such as postpartum depression and inadequate marital support. Blood was drawn for serum IgE at 6 months of age. Parents and offspring subsequently came to the clinic multiple times, with the last clinic visit during the child's sixth year. Follow-up at age 6 involved a clinic visit for allergy and psychosocial evaluations, consisting of interviews and a behavior questionnaire. Seventy-seven children received the allergy and psychosocial evaluation, 26 received the psychosocial evaluation in the clinic, and 30 families received telephone interviews and mailed in questionnaires. Additional monitoring of families by telephone and mail was maintained over the next 2 years, until the children were 8, to ensure accurate characterization of the course of illness. Comprehensive medical records were obtained and reviewed for all health care contacts. Children were designated as having asthma when there was documentation in medical records of physician-diagnosed asthma, observed wheezing, and/or prescription of asthma medications during the time period when the child was between 6 and 8 years of age. Parental reports of the occurrence of asthma corroborated the medical record data., RESULTS: Data regarding asthma status were available for 145 children through 8 years of age. Forty (28%) of the children manifested asthma between 6 and 8 years of age. Among variables previously reported to predict asthma onset by age 3, 3 proved to have significant univariate relationships with asthma between ages 6 and 8: elevated IgE levels measured when the children were 6 months of age, global ratings of parenting difficulties measured when infants were 3 weeks old, and higher numbers of respiratory infections in the first year of life. Among these offspring of mothers with asthma, paternal asthma showed a significant association with asthma between ages 6 and 8. Eczema in the first year was not significantly related to later asthma. Multiple logistic regression showed that the model that best predicted asthma at ages 6 to 8 from infancy variables included 2 main effects. The adjusted odds ratio for 6-month IgE was 2.15 (1.51, 3.05) and for parenting difficulties was 2.07 (1.15, 3.71). Although socioeconomic status (SES) was not associated with asthma at ages 6 to 8, families of lower SES were more likely to be rated as having parenting difficulties early in the child's life. The mothers of lower SES breastfed for a shorter period of time and were more likely to smoke during their infant's first year. There were more respiratory infections during the first year of life among infants whose mother was rated as having more parenting difficulties. Mothers who reported smoking breastfed their infants for a shorter length of time. Male gender was significantly associated with higher IgE levels when infants were 6 months of age. Laboratory testing was completed for 77 children at age 6. Total serum IgE levels were significantly higher for the children with asthma between ages 6 and 8. Skin-prick testing showed that the children with asthma had significantly more positive skin test reactions than did the children without asthma. Psychosocial interview data at 6 years of age were available for 103 families, and behavioral questionnaires were available for 133 families. On the basis of 6-year interviews, children with asthma were rated as being at greater psychological risk than were the children without asthma. Mothers' Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) ratings of their children's behavior indicated higher internalizing scores for the children with asthma as compared with the children without asthma. Like the 6-month IgE, 6-year IgE was higher for boys. IgE levels measured at 6 months of age were significantly correlated with 6-year IgE levels. Parenting difficulties measured at 3 weeks were significantly correlated with 6-year measures of maternal depression, CBCL Internalizing score, and Child Psychological Risk (CPR) score. There also were significant correlations among the psychosocial variables assessed when the children were 6 years of age; maternal depression was significantly associated with child CBCL Internalizing score and CPR score, and the last 2 also were significantly correlated. Multiple logistic regression showed that 2 concurrently measured variables entered the model showing the strongest associations with asthma at ages 6 to 8. The adjusted odds ratio for CPR score was 3.21 (1.29-7.96) and for 6-year IgE was 1.71 (1.04-2.80)., CONCLUSIONS: This study of the natural history of childhood asthma focused on the development of asthma into the school-age years in a genetically at-risk group of children. The relationships between biological and psychosocial variables in the first year and school-age asthma support the formulation of asthma as beginning early in life, with the developing immune system interacting with environmental influences. The data provide support for the possible contribution of psychosocial factors to asthma onset and persistence into childhood.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Some retrospective evidence suggests that children with a history of croup may be at increased risk of subsequently developing asthma, atopy, and diminished pulmonary function. The objective of this study was to determine the long-term outcome of croup (as diagnosed by a physician) in early life., METHODS: Lower respiratory illnesses (LRIs) in the first 3 years of life were assessed in 884 children who were enrolled in a large longitudinal study of airway diseases at birth. Pulmonary function tests, markers of atopy, and wheezing episodes were studied at different ages between birth and 13 years., RESULTS: Ten percent of children had croup with wheeze (Croup/Wheeze), 5% had croup without wheeze (Croup/No Wheeze), 36% had another LRI (Other LRI), and 48% had no LRI. Respiratory syncytial virus was more frequently isolated in children with Croup/Wheeze and Other LRI than in those with Croup/No Wheeze. There was no association between croup in early life and markers of atopy measured during the school years. Only children with Croup/Wheeze and with Other LRI had a significant risk of subsequent persistent wheeze later in life. Significantly lower levels of indices of intrapulmonary airway function were observed at ages <1 (before any LRI), 6, and 11 years in children with Croup/Wheeze and Other LRI compared with children with No LRI. Conversely, inspiratory resistance before any LRI episode was significantly higher in infants who later developed Croup/No Wheeze than in the other 3 groups., CONCLUSIONS: We distinguish 2 manifestations of croup with and without wheezing. Children who present with croup may or may not be at increased risk of subsequent recurrent lower airway obstruction, depending on the initial lower airway involvement, and preillness and postillness abnormalities in lung function associated with this condition.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Residential exposures are recognized risk factors for childhood asthma, but the relative contribution of specific risk factors and the overall contribution of housing to asthma in US children is unknown. The objective of this study was to identify risk factors and estimate the population attributable risk of residential exposures for doctor-diagnosed asthma for US children., METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from 1988 to 1994. Survey participants were 8257 children who were <6 years old and who participated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a survey of the health and nutritional status of children and adults in the United States. The main outcome measure was doctor-diagnosed asthma, as reported by the parent., RESULTS: Six percent of children had doctor-diagnosed asthma. The prevalence of asthma was higher among boys (6.7%) than girls (5.1%) and was higher among black children (8.9%) than white children (5.2%). Risk factors for doctor-diagnosed asthma included a family history of atopy (odds ratio [OR]: 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5, 3.1), child's history of allergy to a pet (OR: 24.2; 95% CI: 8.4, 69.5), exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (OR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.2-2.6), use of a gas stove or oven for heat (OR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.02-3.2), and presence of a dog in the household (OR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.1, 2.3). The population attributable risk of >/=1 residential exposure for doctor-diagnosed asthma in US children <6 years old was 39.2%, or an estimated 533 000 excess cases, whereas having a family history of atopy accounted for 300 000. The attributable cost of asthma as a result of residential exposures for children <6 years old was $402 million (95% CI: $296-$507 million) annually., CONCLUSIONS: The elimination of identified residential risk factors, if causally associated with asthma, would result in a 39% decline in doctor-diagnosed asthma among US children <6 years old.

N2  - Events in early life contribute to subsequent risk of asthma; however, the causes and trajectories of childhood wheeze are heterogeneous and do not always result in asthma. Similarly, not all atopic individuals develop wheeze, and vice versa. The reasons for these differences are unclear. Using unsupervised model-based cluster analysis, we identified latent clusters within a prospective birth cohort with deep immunological and respiratory phenotyping. We characterised each cluster in terms of immunological profile and disease risk, and replicated our results in external cohorts from the UK and USA. We discovered three distinct trajectories, one of which is a high-risk 'atopic' cluster with increased propensity for allergic diseases throughout childhood. Atopy contributes varyingly to later wheeze depending on cluster membership. Our findings demonstrate the utility of unsupervised analysis in elucidating heterogeneity in asthma pathogenesis and provide a foundation for improving management and prevention of childhood asthma.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Effective outpatient care is believed to prevent hospitalization and emergency department (ED) visits resulting from childhood asthma. The aim of this study was to suggest priority areas for intervention by identifying outpatient management practices associated with the risk of these adverse outcomes in a large population., METHODS: This case-control study included children aged 0 to 14 years with asthma who were members of a regional health maintenance organization. Cases were children undergoing either a hospitalization or an ED visit for asthma during the study period. Control subjects were children with asthma without a hospitalization or an ED visit during the study period who were matched to patients on age, gender, and number of asthma-related hospitalizations in the past 24 months. Data on provider and parent asthma management practices were collected using chart review, closed-ended telephone interviews with parents, and computerized use databases. Multivariate analyses were conducted using conditional logistic regression models., RESULTS: Data were collected on 508 cases and 990 control subjects. A total of 43% of cases were reported by their parents to have moderately severe or severe asthma, compared with 20% of control subjects. Parents of cases with hospitalization were less likely than control subjects to have a written asthma management plan (44% vs 51%) and to report washing bedsheets in hot water at least twice a month (77% vs 86%). Cases with hospitalization were more likely to have a nebulizer (74% vs 56%). In the final multivariate model, race/ethnicity was not associated with having had either a hospitalization or an ED visit, as was lower socioeconomic status. Having a written asthma management plan [odds ratio (OR): 0.54; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.30, 0.99] and washing bedsheets in hot water at least twice a month (OR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.21, 0.94) were associated with reduced odds of hospitalization. Having a written asthma management plan (OR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.76) and starting or increasing medications at the onset of a cold or flu were associated with reduced odds of making an ED visit., CONCLUSIONS: Practices that support early intervention for asthma flare-ups by parents at home, particularly written management plans, are strongly associated with reduced risk of adverse outcomes among children with asthma.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - OBJECTIVES: We examined the relationships among maternal smoking in pregnancy, fetal development, and the risk of asthma in childhood., METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study, where all 58 841 singleton births were followed for 7 years using nationwide registries., RESULTS: Maternal smoking increased the risk of asthma (adjusted odds ratio = 1.35; 95% confidence interval = 1.13, 1.62 for high exposure). Low birthweight and preterm delivery increased the risk of asthma at the age of 7, whereas being small for gestational age did not., CONCLUSIONS: Maternal smoking in pregnancy increases the risk of asthma during the first 7 years of life, and only a small fraction of the effect seems to be mediated through fetal growth.

T1  - The increase in allergic respiratory diseases: survival of the fittest?.
A1  - Varner, Arthur E
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - The prevalence of allergic respiratory diseases, asthma and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, has increased since the advent of industrialization. The inverse relationship between the number of infections early in life and atopy has been interpreted as the "hygiene hypothesis." That is, many infections early in life promote the development of T helper type 1 cytokines, while fewer infections early in life favor the development of T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokines and atopy. An alternate interpretation of the same data, that atopy is protective against infections early in life, is rarely considered. With epidemiologic, historical, and immunologic data, I suggest that human evolution has favored individuals with an atopic predisposition. Th2 immune responses promote parity, and ensure successful pregnancy and term birth; provide the infant protection against infections and the inflammation induced by common pathogens in the first years of life until the immune system matures; and protect young adults exposed to viral respiratory pathogens. These traits are of particular value with the advent of industrialization, especially so in the era prior to the development of antibiotics. This theory contradicts the assumption that there is no biological or evolutionary advantage for allergic disease to exist in humans and has significant implications for our current and future treatments of allergic diseases.

T1  - Asthma hospitalizations and mortality in Chicago: an epidemiologic overview.
A1  - Thomas, S D
A1  - Whitman, S
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To characterize the patterns and correlates of asthma hospitalizations and mortality in Chicago., DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of discharge data for 1996 and mortality time trend data for the period from 1990 to 1997., SETTING: The city of Chicago, IL, with Cook County, IL, and US data employed for comparisons., POPULATION STUDIED: People who were hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of asthma and people whose underlying cause of death was asthma., INTERVENTIONS: None., MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The 1996 asthma hospitalization rate for Chicago was 42.8 per 10,000, more than twice as high as suburban Chicago or US rates. Medicaid patients were overrepresented. Length of stay was longer for older patients and Medicaid patients. Age-adjusted asthma mortality in Chicago was 4.7 times higher in non-Hispanic blacks than in non-Hispanic whites. The black/white asthma mortality ratio is 2.5:1 for the nation overall. Asthma mortality rates for Hispanics in Chicago were between those of non-Hispanic whites and blacks but have almost doubled during this decade., CONCLUSIONS: The rising asthma mortality and high asthma hospitalization rates in Chicago constitute a significant public health problem. Comorbidities more common in urban environments, such as substance abuse, may play a unique role in determining the distribution of adverse outcomes within Chicago's population. Asthma hospitalizations and deaths may vary in their risk profiles, and this should be taken into account when developing research and intervention strategies.

N2  - Data from the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES) (1982 through 1984) and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) II (1976 through 1980) were used to examine reported physician-diagnosed asthma among 6-month-old through 11-year-old children. The highest prevalence of active asthma was reported for Puerto Ricans: 11.2% compared with 3.3% for non-Hispanic Whites, 5.9% for non-Hispanic Blacks, 2.7% for Mexican Americans, and 5.2% for Cubans. Health services utilization and severity do not appear to explain the differences between Puerto Ricans and Mexican Americans. Educational programs on asthma should consider focusing on Puerto Ricans.

T1  - Impact of parental smoking on the prevalence of wheezing respiratory illness in children.
A1  - Stoddard, J J

Y1  - 1995//
N2  - To quantitatively assess environmental tobacco smoke exposure from parental smoking as a risk factor for asthma or wheezing in childhood, and to derive estimates of excess asthma/wheezing lower respiratory tract illness cases attributable to this risk factor, a cross-sectional analysis of the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey (a national probability sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population) was undertaken. The National Medical Expenditure Survey included 7,578 children and youth less than 18 years of age in a stratified cluster sampling of US households. After using logistic regression analysis to control for sex, race/ethnicity, region of residence, population density, poverty status, maternal educational level, family size, and father's current smoking status, children whose mothers smoked at the time of the survey were more likely than children of nonsmoking mothers to experience wheezing respiratory illness (odds ratio = 1.36, 95% confidence interval 1.14-1.62). The association was greatest among children less than 2 years of age. The authors' estimate of the attributable risk in the US population indicates that maternal smoking is responsible for approximately 380,000 excess cases of childhood asthma/wheezing lower respiratory tract illness or 7.5% of the total number of such symptomatic children.

N2  - During the dengue haemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) epidemic in Cuba in 1981, we identified some individual risk factors for the development of the severe clinical picture or for the fatal outcome of the disease. The percentage of secondary infection in 3 groups of patients with DHF/DSS was between 95 and 98.3 and it is concluded that secondary infection is an important, but not the only, condition for the development of DHF/DSS. An analysis of these 3 groups of patients and a fourth group of fatal cases showed that chronic diseases such as bronchial asthma, diabetes mellitus and sickle cell anaemia were additional risk factors contributing significantly to the development of DHF/DSS. The study also revealed that race was an individual risk factor, since DHF/DSS was more prevalent in white than in black persons.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Obesity has been proposed to be a risk factor for the development of childhood asthma., OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine weight status from birth to age 5 years in relation to the occurrence of asthma at ages 6 and 8 years., METHODS: Two hundred eighty-five full-term high-risk newborns with at least 1 asthmatic/atopic parent enrolled in the Childhood Origin of Asthma project were studied from birth to age 8 years. Overweight was defined by weight-for-length percentiles of greater than the 85th percentile before the age of 2 years and a body mass index percentile of greater than the 85th percentile at ages 2 to 5 years., RESULTS: No significant concurrent association was found between overweight status and wheezing/asthma occurrence at each year of age. In contrast, longitudinal analyses revealed complex relationships between being overweight and asthma. Being overweight at age 1 year was associated with a decreased risk of asthma at age 6 (odds ratio [OR], 0.32; P = .02) and 8 (OR, 0.35; P = .04) years, as well as better lung function. However, being overweight beyond infancy was not associated with asthma occurrence. In fact, only children who were overweight at age 5 years but not at age 1 year had an increased risk of asthma at age 6 years (OR, 5.78; P = .05)., CONCLUSION: In children genetically at high risk of asthma, being overweight at age 1 year was associated with a decreased risk of asthma and better lung function at ages 6 and 8 years. However, being overweight beyond infancy did not have any protective effect and even could confer a higher risk for asthma. Copyright © 2010 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In 2009, pandemic H1N1 influenza A caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide; however, available data on disease characteristics and outcome of hospitalized children is limited., DESIGN AND SETTING: A prospective cohort study of children who required hospitalization because of the influenza A (H1N1) infection at King Khalid University Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, over 6 months (July- December, 2009)., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data was collected using a predesigned form for all admitted pediatric cases (0-12 years) presenting with the influenza-like illness and who tested positive for the novel influenza (H1N1) using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay. The clinical course and features associated with the severe disease among such children were described, RESULTS: Out of 1103 children with the influenza-like illness, 375 (34%) were confirmed pediatric cases of influenza A (H1N1), of whom 50 (13.3%) required hospitalization. The median age was 3 years (range, 1 month-12 years). Fever was the most frequent symptom (94%) at admission, followed by cough (86%) and other symptoms including vomiting and diarrhea. The majority (70%) of children had at least one underlying medical condition, with bronchial asthma being the most common (40%). All cases were treated with oseltamivir. Five children (10%) were admitted to the ICU, 4 required mechanical ventilation, and 2 died (4%)., CONCLUSIONS: The majority of children with 2009 H1N1 influenza A-associated hospitalization in this series had an uncomplicated course. Respiratory complications and ICU admissions were more frequent in those with underlying disease, especially asthma and neuromuscular diseases. Efforts need to be focused prior to each influenza season and special emphasis needs to be given to children by immunizing them with H1N1 influenza A vaccination to avoid severe disease and minimize complications.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between the duration of exclusive breast feeding and the development of asthma related outcomes in children at age 6 years., DESIGN: Prospective cohort study., SETTING: Western Australia., SUBJECTS: 2187 children ascertained through antenatal clinics at the major tertiary obstetric hospital in Perth and followed to age 6 years., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Unconditional logistic regression to model the association between duration of exclusive breast feeding and outcomes related to asthma or atopy at 6 years of age, allowing for several important confounders: sex, gestational age, smoking in the household, and early childcare., RESULTS: After adjustment for confounders, the introduction of milk other than breast milk before 4 months of age was a significant risk factor for all asthma and atopy related outcomes in children aged 6 years: asthma diagnosed by a doctor (odds ratio 1.25, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.52); wheeze three or more times since 1 year of age (1.41, 1.14 to 1.76); wheeze in the past year (1.31, 1.05 to 1.64); sleep disturbance due to wheeze within the past year (1.42, 1.07 to 1.89); age when doctor diagnosed asthma (hazard ratio 1.22, 1.03 to 1.43); age at first wheeze (1.36, 1.17 to 1.59); and positive skin prick test reaction to at least one common aeroallergen (1.30, 1.04 to 1.61)., CONCLUSION: A significant reduction in the risk of childhood asthma at age 6 years occurs if exclusive breast feeding is continued for at least the 4 months after birth. These findings are important for our understanding of the cause of childhood asthma and suggest that public health interventions to optimise breast feeding may help to reduce the community burden of childhood asthma and its associated traits.

N2  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: The Vesta project aims to assess the role of traffic related air pollution in the occurrence of childhood asthma., DESIGN AND SETTING: Case-control study conducted in five French metropolitan areas between 1998 and 2000. A set of 217 pairs of matched 4 to 14 years old cases and controls were investigated. An index of lifelong exposure to traffic exhausts was constructed, using retrospective information on traffic density close to all home and school addresses since birth; this index was also calculated for the 0-3 years age period to investigate the effect of early exposures., MAIN RESULTS: Adjusted on environmental tobacco smoke, personal and parental allergy, and several confounders, lifelong exposure was not associated with asthma. In contrast, associations before age of 3 were significant: odds ratios for tertiles 2 and 3 of the exposure index, relative to tertile 1, exhibited a positive trend (1.48 (95%CI = 0.7 to 3.0) and 2.28 (1.1 to 4.6)), with greater odds ratios among subjects with positive skin prick tests., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that traffic related pollutants might have contributed to the asthma epidemic that has taken place during the past decades among children.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Uncontrolled studies suggest that psychosocial factors and health behaviour may be important in asthma death., METHODS: A community based case-control study of 533 cases, comprising 78% of all asthma deaths under age 65 years and 533 hospital controls individually matched for age, district and asthma admission date corresponding to date of death was undertaken in seven regions of Britain (1994-98). Data were extracted blind from anonymised copies of primary care records for the previous 5 years and non-blind for the earlier period., RESULTS: 60% of cases and 63% of controls were female. The median age in both groups was 53. Cases had an earlier age of asthma onset, more chronic obstructive lung disease, and were more obese. 48% of cases and 42% of controls had a health behaviour problem; repeated non-attendance/poor inhaler technique was related to increased risk of death. Overall, 85% and 86%, respectively, had a psychosocial problem. Four psychosocial factors were associated with increased risk of death (psychosis, alcohol/drug abuse, financial/employment problems, learning difficulties) and two with reduced risk (anxiety/prescription of antidepressant drugs and sexual problems). While alcohol/drug abuse lost significance after adjustment for psychosis, other associations appeared independent of each other and of indicators of severity and co-morbidity. None of the remaining 13 factors including family problems, domestic abuse, bereavement, and social isolation were significantly related to risk of asthma death., CONCLUSION: There was an apparently high burden of psychosocial problems in both cases and controls. The associations between health behaviour, psychosocial factors, and asthma death are varied and complex with a limited number of factors showing positive relationships.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between infant feeding and childhood asthma is controversial. This study tested the hypothesis that the relation between breast feeding and childhood asthma is altered by the presence of maternal asthma., METHODS: Healthy non-selected newborn infants (n = 1246) were enrolled at birth. Asthma was defined as a physician diagnosis of asthma plus asthma symptoms reported on > or = 2 questionnaires at 6, 9, 11 or 13 years. Recurrent wheeze (> or = 4 episodes in the past year) was reported by questionnaire at seven ages in the first 13 years of life. Duration of exclusive breast feeding was based on prospective physician reports or parental questionnaires completed at 18 months. Atopy was assessed by skin test responses at the age of 6 years., RESULTS: The relationship between breast feeding, asthma, and wheeze differed with the presence or absence of maternal asthma and atopy in the child. After adjusting for confounders, children with asthmatic mothers were significantly more likely to have asthma if they had been exclusively breast fed (OR 8.7, 95% CI 3.4 to 22.2). This relationship was only evident for atopic children and persisted after adjusting for confounders. In contrast, the relation between recurrent wheeze and breast feeding was age dependent. In the first 2 years of life exclusive breast feeding was associated with significantly lower rates of recurrent wheeze (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.9), regardless of the presence or absence of maternal asthma or atopy in the child. Beginning at the age of 6 years, exclusive breast feeding was unrelated to prevalence of recurrent wheeze, except for children with asthmatic mothers in whom it was associated with a higher odds ratio for wheeze (OR 5.7, 95% CI 2.3 to 14.1), especially if the child was atopic., CONCLUSION: The relationship between breast feeding and asthma or recurrent wheeze varies with the age of the child and the presence or absence of maternal asthma and atopy in the child. While associated with protection against recurrent wheeze early in life, breast feeding is associated with an increased risk of asthma and recurrent wheeze beginning at the age of 6 years, but only for atopic children with asthmatic mothers.

N2  - BACKGROUND: A study was undertaken to identify asthma patients at risk of an attack and to assess the economic impact of treatment strategies., METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis of a representative data set of 12 203 patients with asthma in the UK over a one year period was performed. Logistic multiple regression was used to model the probability of an attack occurring using a set of categorised predictor factors. Health service costs were calculated by applying published average unit costs to the patient resource data. The main outcome measures were attack incidence, health service resource use, drug treatment, and cost estimates for most aspects of asthma related health care., RESULTS: Children under five years of age accounted for 597 patients (5%), 3362 (28%) were aged 5-15 years, 4315 (35%) 16-44, 3446 (28%) 45-74, and 483 (4%) were aged over 74 years. A total of 9016 patients (74%) were on some form of prophylactic asthma medication; 2653 (22%) experienced an attack in the year data collection occurred. Overall health care expenditure was estimated at pound2.04 million. The average cost per patient who had an attack was pound381 compared with pound108 for those who did not, an increase of more than 3.5 times. In those aged under five and those over 75 years of age there were no significant markers to identify risk, but both groups were small in size. The level of treatment step in the British Thoracic Society (BTS) asthma guidelines was a statistically significant factor for all other age groups. Night time symptoms were significant in the 5-15, 16-44 and 45-74 age groups, exercise induced symptoms were only significant for the 5-15 age group, and poor inhaler technique in the 16-44 age group., CONCLUSIONS: Patients at any treatment step of the BTS asthma guidelines are at risk of an asthma attack, the risk increasing as the treatment step increases. Poorly controlled asthma may have a considerable impact on health care costs. Appropriate targeting of preventive measures could therefore reduce overall health care costs and the growing pressures on hospital services associated with asthma management.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Death from asthma is regarded as preventable in principle, especially under the age of 65 years., METHODS: In 1994 a confidential inquiry was set up to investigate deaths attributable to asthma in residents of Wales under the age of 65 years. During the period of the inquiry 92 cases were notified as being ascribed to asthma, or (in 1996) having a mention of asthma on the death certificate. Of these, 80 were investigated further with the help of general practitioners, hospital notes, and relatives. The details were then considered by a small panel of doctors who endeavoured to identify factors that may have contributed to the deaths., RESULTS: Asthma was considered to be the underlying cause of 52 deaths. Although disease severity was usually a major factor, some aspect of the patient's behaviour or circumstances seemed to have contributed to 31 deaths, while in 15 cases there was probably a deficiency in medical care., CONCLUSIONS: Some preventable asthma deaths still occur, particularly in relation to inadequate treatment. Factors associated with patients' behaviour and circumstances are more difficult to tackle but, if doctors are aware of high risk patients, increased vigilance may prevent some deaths.

T1  - Risk factors for readmission to hospital for asthma in childhood.

Y1  - 1994//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Readmissions account for part of the increase in hospital admissions for asthma in childhood seen in many countries., METHODS: This observational study recorded demographic features and the severity, treatment and management of asthma in 1034 individual children admitted to hospital over a one year period, followed for a maximum of 33 months., RESULTS: Readmissions were common, with 33% readmitted by six months and 51% by two years. After controlling for a wide range of variables, factors that significantly increased readmission were: female sex (relative risk (RR) 1.23; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.46), young age (age < 5 years RR 1.71; 95% CI 1.41 to 2.08), number of previous admissions (one previous admission RR 1.32; two, RR 1.68; three, RR 2.00; four or more, RR 2.80), and inpatient intravenous treatment (RR 1.29; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.55). Inpatient treatment with theophylline was used frequently (98.4%), but was associated with decreased readmissions (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.92). Factors which did not predict readmission included ethnicity, respiratory and pulse rate, medical team, prescribed prophylactic treatment, type of follow up, or the use of action plans., CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for readmission relate to the characteristics of the individual (age and sex), severity of the condition (intravenous treatment), and number of previous admissions which may reflect severity or behaviour of the illness. Medical treatment and management did not influence readmissions. Strategies to reduce the high readmission rate for asthma in childhood need to be developed.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In tropical Africa the role of microbial agents of acute respiratory infections in acute exacerbations of bronchial asthma remains largely unexplored. However, empirical antibacterial therapy is frequently initiated in moderate to severe cases of acute asthma with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. A study was set up to determine how often acute respiratory infection is associated with acute asthma, to identify the associated pathogens, and to proffer appropriate therapeutic suggestions., METHODS: Over a 16 month period, 86 episodes of acute asthma were studied for clinical and laboratory features of acute respiratory infection at the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan. Virological diagnosis was based on immunofluorescence studies of nasopharyngeal aspirates and/or serological tests using the microtitre complement fixation technique. Throat swabs and blood were cultured for bacterial agents., RESULTS: Of the 64 cases who presented with rhinorrhoea, 51 (79.7%) were pyrexial (T > or = 37.6 degrees C). Inflammatory changes (frequently interstitial streakiness) were identified in 10 (19.6%) of the 51 chest radiographs; only two of these had lobar shadowing. Significant bacterial isolates were made in only three (3.5%) of the throat swabs and two (2.4%) of the blood cultures from the 86 cases; none had clinical septicaemia. On the other hand, 55 viral agents were identified from 39 (53%) of the 74 subjects studied; 16 (41.0%) had dual viral identifications. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) accounted for 20 (36.4%) identifications, parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 3 for 15 (27.3%), and influenza type A (Flu A) for 12 (21.8%). Viral identifications were significantly higher in infants and preschool subjects (< 5 years) and in those presenting with either rhinorrhoea or pyrexia., CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study underscore the importance of viral upper respiratory infections in asthma exacerbations in a tropical setting. The paucity of clinical and investigative features of bacterial acute respiratory infection suggests that there is little rationale for routine antibiotic cover in children with acute exacerbations of asthma in the tropics.

N2  - AIM: To investigate the association between a history of otitis media and respiratory tract infections in infancy and allergic sensitisation and asthma in school age children of atopic and non-atopic parents., METHODS: Based on a survey of 4585 schoolchildren, three groups of children aged 6-16 years were selected, of whom 502 were eligible with complete data: (1) diagnosed asthma (n = 166); (2) wheeze within past 12 months (n = 155); and (3) no asthma/no wheeze (n = 181). This study population was further analyzed by subgroups of children with or without parental atopy. Main outcome measures were allergic sensitisation verified by skin prick test and asthma., RESULTS: Children of atopic parents had a reduced risk of developing allergic sensitisation in school age if they had a combined history of both otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections during infancy (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.13, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.50) or a history of otitis media (aOR 0.31, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.83). A history of lower respiratory tract infections in infancy increased the risk of asthma in children of non-atopic parents (aOR 4.21, 95% CI 1.68 to 10.57)., CONCLUSION: In the present study population, a history of otitis media in infancy seems to be negatively associated with allergic sensitisation in school age children of atopic parents, whereas a history of lower respiratory tract infections was positively associated with asthma in children of non-atopic parents.

N2  - AIMS: To discover the incidence of fatal and severe allergic reactions to food in a large population of children., METHODS: A retrospective search for fatalities in children 0-15 years from 1990 to February 1998, primarily of death certification at offices of national statistics. A prospective survey of fatal and severe reactions from March 1998 to February 2000, primarily through the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: were deaths and severe reactions. A case was deemed severe if one or more of the following criteria was met: cardiorespiratory arrest; need for inotropic support; fluid bolus >20 ml/kg; more than one dose of epinephrine; more than one dose of nebulised bronchodilator. A case was deemed near fatal if intubation was necessary., RESULTS: The UK under 16 population is 13 million. Over the past 10 years, eight children died (incidence of 0.006 deaths per 100 000 children 0-15 years per year). Milk caused four of the deaths. No child under 13 died from peanut allergy. Two children died despite receiving early epinephrine before admission to hospital; one child with a mild food allergic reaction died from epinephrine overdose. Over the past two years, there were six near fatal reactions (none caused by peanut) and 49 severe ones (10 caused by peanut), yielding incidences of 0.02 and 0.19 per 100 000 children 0-15 years per year respectively. Coexisting asthma is more strongly associated with a severe reaction than the severity of previous reactions., CONCLUSIONS: If 5% of the child population have food allergy, the risk that a food allergic child will die from a food allergic reaction is about 1 in 800 000 per year. The food allergic child with asthma may be at higher risk. Prescribing an epinephrine autoinjector requires a careful balance of advantages and disadvantages.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Early-life respiratory tract infections could affect airway obstruction and increase asthma risk in later life. However, results from previous studies are inconsistent., OBJECTIVE: We examined the associations of early-life respiratory tract infections with lung function and asthma in school-aged children., METHODS: This study among 5197 children born between April 2002 and January 2006 was embedded in a population-based prospective cohort study. Information on physician-attended upper and lower respiratory tract infections until age 6 years (categorised into <= 3 and >3-6 years) was obtained by annual questionnaires. Spirometry measures and physician-diagnosed asthma were assessed at age 10 years., RESULTS: Upper respiratory tract infections were not associated with adverse respiratory outcomes. Compared with children without lower respiratory tract infections <=3 years, children with lower respiratory tract infections <=3 years had a lower FEV1, FVC, FEV1:FVC and forced expiratory flow at 75% of FVC (FEF75) (Z-score (95% CI): ranging from -0.22 (-0.31 to -0.12) to -0.12 (-0.21 to -0.03)) and an increased risk of asthma (OR (95% CI): 1.79 (1.19 to 2.59)). Children with lower respiratory tract infections >3-6 years had an increased risk of asthma (3.53 (2.37 to 5.17)) only. Results were not mediated by antibiotic or paracetamol use and not modified by inhalant allergic sensitisation. Cross-lagged modelling showed that results were not bidirectional and independent of preschool wheezing patterns., CONCLUSION: Early-life lower respiratory tract infections <=3 years are most consistently associated with lower lung function and increased risk of asthma in school-aged children.

N2  - The etiology of asthma includes lifestyle factors. Breastfeeding and introduction of complementary foods have been suggested to affect asthma risk, but the scientific foundation is not solid. Children from the birth cohort All Babies In Southeast Sweden study were included (n = 9727). Breastfeeding duration and timing of introduction of infant formula and food were collected prospectively during the first year. Through linkage to the Swedish Patient Register, 948 children were identified with any asthma until age 15-17 years, of which 450 cases were atopic. Breastfeeding duration was not associated to risk of asthma. Introduction of infant formula earlier than at 14 weeks of age was associated with higher risk of non-atopic asthma. Introduction of fish before 43 weeks of age, as compared to later, was associated with a lower risk of asthma, irrespective of atopic classification. Reverse causation was accounted for but did not explain the results. Conclusion: Introduction of infant formula and timing of introduction of fish seem to impact the long-term risk of doctor-diagnosed asthma. Emphasis on the growing body of evidence that early introduction of allergens offers protection against atopic disease should be considered in future recommendations. What is Known: * Breastfeeding and introduction of complementary foods might influence the risk of atopic diseases. Recently, a review stated that more studies are needed to clarify the role for asthma development. What is New: * Introduction of infant formula earlier than at 14 weeks of age was associated with a higher risk of developing non-atopic asthma. The risk was pronounced in children introduced to infant formula before 4 weeks of age while being breastfed less than 4 weeks. * Early fish introduction, before 43 weeks of age, was associated with a lower risk of asthma, independent of atopic classification of asthma.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To study whether the duration of breastfeeding and time for introduction of complementary foods was associated with the risk of childhood asthma., STUDY DESIGN: We used data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Study, a nationwide prospective cohort study that recruited pregnant women from across Norway between 1999 and 2008. Children with complete data of breastfeeding up to 18 months and current age >7 years were eligible (n = 41 020). Asthma as the primary outcome was defined based on >=2 dispensed asthma medications at age 7 years registered in the Norwegian Prescription Database. We used log-binomial regression models to obtain crude relative risks (RRs) in the main analysis, and adjusted for selected confounders in multivariable analyses., RESULTS: For duration of any breastfeeding, 5.9% of infants breastfed <6 months (adjusted RR [aRR] 1.05, 0.93-1.19) and 4.6% breastfed 6-11 months (aRR 0.96, 0.87-1.07) had dispensed asthma medications at age 7 years compared with 4.6% of infants breastfed >=12 months (Ptrend .62). Infants still breastfed at 6 months, but introduced to complementary foods <4 months and 4-6 months, had an aRR of 1.15 (0.98-1.36) and 1.09 (0.94-1.27) respectively, compared with infants fully breastfed for 6 months (Ptrend .09). Ages at introduction of solids or formula separately were not significant predictors (Ptrend .16 and .08, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: We found no association between duration of breastfeeding or age of introduction to complementary foods and asthma at age 7 years.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The question of whether children's exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) contributes to their development of asthma is unresolved. We conducted a systematic review and performed meta-analyses to analyze the association between TRAP and asthma development in childhood., DATA SOURCES: We systematically reviewed epidemiological studies published until 8 September 2016 and available in the Embase, Ovid MEDLINE (R), and Transport databases., STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTIONS: We included studies that examined the association between children's exposure to TRAP metrics and their risk of 'asthma' incidence or lifetime prevalence, from birth to age 18years old., STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: We extracted key characteristics of each included study using a predefined data items template and these were tabulated. We used the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklists to assess the validity of each included study. Where four or more independent risk estimates were available for a continuous pollutant exposure, we conducted overall and age-specific meta-analyses, and four sensitivity analyses for each summary meta-analytic exposure-outcome association., RESULTS: Forty-one studies met our eligibility criteria. There was notable variability in asthma definitions, TRAP exposure assessment methods and confounder adjustment. The overall random-effects risk estimates (95% CI) were 1.08 (1.03, 1.14) per 0.5x10-5m-1 black carbon (BC), 1.05 (1.02, 1.07) per 4mug/m3 nitrogen dioxide (NO2), 1.48 (0.89, 2.45) per 30mug/m3 nitrogen oxides (NOx), 1.03 (1.01, 1.05) per 1mug/m3 Particulate Matter <2.5mum in diameter (PM2.5), and 1.05 (1.02, 1.08) per 2mug/m3 Particulate Matter <10mum in diameter (PM10). Sensitivity analyses supported these findings. Across the main analysis and age-specific analysis, the least heterogeneity was seen for the BC estimates, some heterogeneity for the PM2.5 and PM10 estimates and the most heterogeneity for the NO2 and NOx estimates., LIMITATIONS, CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATION OF KEY FINDINGS: The overall risk estimates from the meta-analyses showed statistically significant associations for BC, NO2, PM2.5, PM10 exposures and risk of asthma development. Our findings support the hypothesis that childhood exposure to TRAP contributes to their development of asthma. Future meta-analyses would benefit from greater standardization of study methods including exposure assessment harmonization, outcome harmonization, confounders' harmonization and the inclusion of all important confounders in individual studies., SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION NUMBER: PROSPERO 2014: CRD42014015448.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There has been no clear consensus about whether prenatal exposure to air pollution contributes to the development of wheezing and asthma in children. We conducted a systematic review to analyze the association between exposure to different pollutants during pregnancy and the development of childhood wheezing and asthma., METHODS: We systematically reviewed epidemiological studies published through June 6, 2017 available in the MEDLINE and Web of Science databases. We included studies that examined the association between prenatal exposure to any air pollutants except tobacco smoke and the incidence or prevalence of "wheezing" or "asthma" from birth to 14 years of age. We extracted key characteristics of each included study using a template of predefined data items. We used the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklists to assess the validity of each included study. We conducted overall and subgroup meta-analyses for each summary exposure-outcome association. Pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by using a random effects model., RESULTS: Eighteen studies met our eligibility criteria. There was notable variability in exposure assessment methods. The overall random effects risk estimates (95% CI) of different pollutants were 1.04 (0.94-1.15) aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), 1.04 (1.01-1.07) NO2, 1.4 (0.97-2.03) PM2.5 for childhood wheeze and 1.07 (1.01-1.14) NO2, 1 (0.97-1.03) PM2.5, 1.02 (0.98-1.07) SO2, 1.08 (1.05-1.12) PM10 for childhood asthma. Minimal heterogeneity was seen for PAH and SO2, while some heterogeneity was observed for PM10, PM2.5 and NO2., CONCLUSIONS: The overall and subgroup risk estimates from the meta-analyses showed statistically significant associations between prenatal exposures to NO2, SO2, and PM10 and the risk of wheezing and asthma development in childhood. There is insufficient evidence to show an effect of prenatal exposure to BC, CO, and O3 on childhood wheezing and asthma. Further studies are needed to examine the individual compounds' effects.

N2  - Previous studies have shown that phthalate exposure in childhood is associated with the development of respiratory problems. However, few studies have assessed the relative impact of prenatal and postnatal exposure to phthalates on the development of asthma later in childhood. Therefore, we assessed the impact of prenatal and postnatal phthalate exposure on the development of asthma and wheezing using a Taiwanese birth cohort. A total of 430 pregnant women were recruited, and 171 (39.8%) of them had their children followed when they were aged 2, 5, and 8 years. The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire was used to assess asthma and wheezing symptoms and serum total immunoglobulin E levels were measured at 8 years of age. Urine samples were obtained from 136 women during their third trimester of pregnancy, 99 children at 2 years of age, and 110 children at 5 years. Four common phthalate monoester metabolites in maternal and children's urine were measured using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Maternal urinary mono-benzyl phthalate [MBzP] concentrations were associated with an increased occurrence of wheezing in boys at 8 years of age (odds ratio [OR] = 4.95 (95% CI 1.08-22.63)), for upper quintile compared to the others) after controlling for parental allergies and family members' smoking status. Urinary mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate [MEHP] levels over the quintile at 2-year-old were associated with increased asthma occurrence (adjusted OR = 6.14 (1.17-32.13)) in boys. Similarly, the sum of di-2-ethyl-hexyl phthalate [DEHP] metabolites at 5 years was associated with asthma in boys (adjusted OR = 4.36 (1.01-18.86)). Urinary MEHP in maternal and 5-year-old children urine were significantly associated with increased IgE in allergic children at 8 years. Prenatal and postnatal exposure to phthalate was associated with the occurrence of asthma in children, particularly for boys.

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies showed that youths who are obese are more likely to have asthma; however, some studies found important sex differences in the risk for asthma., METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the asthma incidence in a Latino cohort of children recruited from birth and followed up until 9 years of age. We subsequently assessed risk factors for asthma and for an early asthma (defined as <4 years of age) diagnosis in relation to obesity. Asthma was assessed via maternal reports and medical records review of the children at 9 years of age. Each child's weight and height were collected annually. Independent and sex-specific risk factors for asthma diagnosis were assessed by using multivariable logistic regression models., RESULTS: In our cohort, 24.6% (42/164) of the children were diagnosed with asthma by 9 years of age. The mean +/- standard deviation age of asthma diagnosis was 29.5 +/- 4.5 months; 79.5% had a diagnosis of asthma at <4 years of age. In girls, any breast-feeding at 6 months was associated with a reduced risk of asthma (odds ratio [OR] 0.21 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.05-0.86]) and obesity at 2 years of was associated with increased risk for asthma (OR 12.14 [95% CI 2.79-53.05]). Exposure to environmental toxins and consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages were associated with a risk for asthma diagnosis after 4 years of age., CONCLUSION: In our high-risk Latino cohort, obesity was associated with asthma development in the girls. In addition, an asthma diagnosis after 4 years of age may be related to environmental toxin exposure and early consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages compared with an earlier diagnosis.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Allergic diseases are thought to be inherited. Prevalence of allergic diseases has, however, increased dramatically in last decades, suggesting environmental causes for the development of allergic diseases., OBJECTIVE: We studied risk factors associated with the development of atopic dermatitis (AD), allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma (AS) in children of non-atopic parents in a subtropical country., METHODS: In a birth cohort of 1,497 newborns, parents were prenatally enrolled and validated for allergic diseases by questionnaire, physician-verified and total or specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels; 1,236 and 756 children, respectively, completed their 3-year and 6-year follow-up. Clinical examination, questionnaire, and blood samples for total and specific IgE of the children were collected at each follow-up visit., RESULTS: Prevalence of AD, AR and AS was, respectively, 8.2%, 30.8% and 12.4% in children of non-atopic parents. Prevalence of AR (p<.001) and AS (p=.018) was significantly higher in children of parents who were both atopic. A combination of Cesarean section (C/S) and breastfeeding for more than 1 month showed the highest risk for AD (OR=3.111, p=.006). Infants living in homes with curtains and no air filters had the highest risk for AR (OR=2.647, p<.001), and male infants of non-atopic parents living in homes without air filters had the highest risk for AS (OR=1.930, p=.039)., CONCLUSIONS: Breastfeeding and C/S affect development of AD. Gender, use of curtains and/or air filters affect AR and AS, suggesting that control of the perinatal environment is necessary for the prevention of atopic diseases in children of non-atopic parents.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure is associated with greater asthma severity in children with physician-diagnosed asthma living in CT, and to examine whether area of residence, race/ethnicity or poverty moderate the association., METHODS: A large childhood asthma database in CT (Easy Breathing) was linked by participant zip code to census data to classify participants by area of residence. Multinomial logistic regression models, adjusted for enrollment date, sex, age, race/ethnicity, area of residence, insurance type, family history of asthma, eczema, and exposure to dogs, cats, gas stove, rodents and cockroaches were used to examine the association between self-reported exposure to SHS and clinician-determined asthma severity (mild, moderate, and severe persistent vs. intermittent asthma)., RESULTS: Of the 30,163 children with asthma enrolled in Easy Breathing, between 6 months and 18 years old, living in 161 different towns in CT, exposure to SHS was associated with greater asthma severity (adjusted relative risk ratio (aRRR): 1.07 [1.00, 1.15] and aRRR: 1.11 [1.02, 1.22] for mild and moderate persistent asthma, respectively). The odds of Black and Puerto Rican/Hispanic children with asthma being exposed to SHS were twice that of Caucasian children. Though the odds of SHS exposure for publicly insured children with asthma were three times greater than the odds for privately insured children (OR: 3.02 [2.84,3,21]), SHS exposure was associated with persistent asthma only among privately insured children (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.23 [1.11,1.37])., CONCLUSION: This is the first large-scale pragmatic study to demonstrate that children exposed to SHS in Connecticut have greater asthma severity, clinically determined using a systematic approach, and varies by insurance status.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the contribution of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) to the subsequent development of severe asthma in different subgroups of children at risk of severe RSV disease., SETTINGS: The study was conducted in New South Wales (NSW), Australia., PARTICIPANTS: The study comprised all children born in NSW between 2000 and 2010 with complete follow-up till 31 December 2011. The cohort was divided into three subgroups: (1) non-Indigenous high-risk children: non-Indigenous children born preterm or born with a low birth weight; (2) Indigenous children: children of mothers whose Indigenous status was recorded as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander and (3) non-Indigenous standard risk children: all other non-Indigenous term children., PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Risk of development of severe asthma in different subgroups of children who had RSV hospitalisation in the first 2 years of life compared with those who did not., DESIGN: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis using population-based linked administrative data. Extended Cox model was used to determine HR and 95% CI around the HR for first asthma hospitalisation in different subgroups of children., RESULTS: The cohort comprised 847 516 children born between 2000 and 2010. In the adjusted Cox model, the HR of first asthma hospitalisation was higher and comparable across all subgroups of children who had RSV hospitalisation compared with those who did not. The HR (95% CI) was highest in children aged 2-3 years; 4.3 (95% CI 3.8 to 4.9) for high-risk, 4.0 (95% CI 3.3 to 4.8) for Indigenous and 3.9 (95% CI 3.7 to 4.1) for non-Indigenous standard risk children. This risk persisted beyond 7 years of age., CONCLUSION: This large study confirms a comparable increased risk of first asthma hospitalisation following RSV disease in the first 2 years of life across different subgroups children at risk.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of birth weight and childhood growth on childhood wheezing disorders. We hypothesised that low birth weight and fast growth during early age would increase the risk of wheezing disorders., SETTING: Observational secondary analysis of data from the Born in Bradford cohort., PARTICIPANTS: All children who were born at the Bradford Royal Infirmary hospital between March 2007 and December 2010 were eligible for the study. A total of 13,734 and 1598 children participated in the analyses of the effects of birth weight and growth on wheezing disorders, respectively., PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Wheezing disorders diagnosis (diagnosed as asthma or had wheezing symptom) during the ages of 0-7 years were the primary outcome measures. Diagnosis of asthma and occurrence of wheezing during the same period were secondary outcome measures. Birth weight was classified as normal (2.5-4.0 kg), low (<2.5 kg) and high (>4.0 kg). Growth mixture models were used to drive growth pattern outcomes which were classified as 'normal', 'fast' and 'slow' growth based on their velocities between birth and 36 months., RESULTS: The adjusted relative risks (RRs) of wheezing disorders diagnosis for the low and high birthweight children were 1.29 (95% CI 1.12 to 1.50; p=0.001) and 0.91 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.04; p=0.17), respectively. The adjusted RRs of wheezing disorders diagnosis were 1.30 (95% CI 0.56 to 3.06; p=0.54) and 0.60 (95% CI 0.16 to 2.18; p=0.44), respectively, for the 'fast' and 'slow' growth as compared with the 'normal' growth., CONCLUSIONS: Low birth weight is associated with an increased risk of wheezing disorders; however, there is a weak evidence that suggests high birthweight children have a reduced risk in this birth cohort. Low birth weight coupled with a slower growth until 3 months and a sharp growth between 3 and 12 months has an increased risk of wheezing disorders diagnosis.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Epigenetic modifications may have a role in asthma susceptibility., OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether epigenetic modification at birth of a CpG site necessary for the regulation of IL-2 transcription (IL-2 Site1) is associated with the development of asthma during childhood., METHODS: Methylation of IL-2 Site1 was assessed in cord blood from 303 children (225 with atopic mothers); as controls, we measured methylation of a site not important in the transcription of IL-2 (IL-2 Site7) and methylation of the LINE-1 repetitive element. Children were followed to the age of 8 years. Information on severe asthma exacerbations and hospital admissions was collected from child's primary care medical record. To account for potential confounding by bronchiolitis, we used exacerbations/hospitalizations after age 1 year as primary outcomes., RESULTS: There were 49 severe exacerbations amongst 33 children, and 22 hospital admissions amongst 11 children. The risk of asthma exacerbation increased 1.07-fold (95% CI 1.01-1.14, P = 0.03) and the risk of hospital admission increased 1.12-fold (95% CI 1.04-1.20, P = 0.002) for each one per cent increase in IL-2 Site1 methylation. Children who were admitted to hospital at any time-point had significantly higher IL-2 Site1 methylation than children not admitted to hospital (P = 0.007). There was a significant interaction between age at exacerbation (P = 0.03) or hospital admission (P = 0.02) and methylation, with the effect of methylation increasing with increasing age. Methylation of the control IL-2 Site7 or LINE-1 was not a significant predictor of asthma exacerbations/hospital admission, and we found no association between IL-2 Site1 methylation and hospital admissions for other reasons (0.99 [0.92-1.06]). Cord blood mononuclear cell phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphoproliferative responses decreased significantly with increasing IL-2 Site1 methylation (P < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Increasing methylation in cord blood of a functional CpG site in the IL-2 promoter is associated with increased likelihood of severe asthma exacerbations and hospital admissions for asthma/wheeze between ages of 2 and 8 years.

N2  - The NACManchester Asthma and Allergy Study is a prospective study of the development of asthma and allergies in childhood. The subjects (995 children at age 3 years) were recruited in utero by screening parents in the antenatal clinic using skin prick testing and a questionnaire regarding allergic diseases. Children were assigned to risk groups according to parental atopic status (high risk, both parents atopic; medium risk, one parent atopic; low risk, neither parent atopic). A subgroup of those at high risk (with no pets in the home) was randomized to stringent environmental control (allergen impermeable covers for the parental and infant bed, hot washing of bedding weekly, HEPA vacuum cleaner, hard floor for the nursery), and the remainder followed a normal regime. The children have been followed prospectively. The environmental influences are very clearly defined. Measurements of environmental exposures include levels of house dust mite; cat and dog allergens during pregnancy and early life; pet ownership and exposure; childcare arrangements; number of siblings; vaccination uptake; thorough dietary questionnaire; and endotoxin exposure. Further unique objective outcome in the cohort is the assessment of lung function in preschool children using specific airways resistance, which at age 3 years clearly reflects both genetic and environmental influences.

T1  - The childhood origins of asthma (COAST) study.
A1  - Lemanske, Robert F Jr
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Although asthma is probably a heterogeneous disease or syndrome, three factors and/or events consistently emerge for their ability to significantly influence asthma inception in the first decade of life: immune response aberrations, which appear to be defined best by the concept of cytokine dysregulation; lower respiratory tract infections, in particular respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); and some form of gene-environment interaction that needs to occur at a critical time-period in the development of the immune system or the lung. It remains to be firmly established, however, how any one or all of these factors, either independently or interactively, influence the development of childhood asthma. For example, cytokine dysregulation (T helper 1/T helper 2 imbalance) appears to track best epidemiologically with allergic diseases. As not everyone who undergoes allergic sensitization develops asthma, some other host-environment interaction must need to occur to target this chronic allergic inflammatory response to the lower airway. Some evidence suggests that this event might be an environmental insult in the form of a virus infection, particularly with RSV, which has a predilection for infecting, destroying, and/or in some way biologically altering lower airway epithelium. However, only a fraction of children develop recurrent wheezing following RSV infections, despite the fact that nearly all children have been infected at least once by 2 years of age. Thus, although RSV infections may have the potential of targeting the inflammatory response to the lower airway, they may only be able to do so during a vulnerable time-period during development of the immune system or lung. This developmental component may further reflect important gene-environment interactions that regulate both short- and long-term airway physiological alterations that manifest themselves clinically as childhood asthma. Efforts to determine and define the importance of these three factors to asthma pathogenesis are the focus and goal of the COAST (Childhood Origins of Asthma) project.

N1  - Comment in (CIN)
N2  - Previous studies have shown that the highest incidence of acute chest syndrome (ACS) in sickle cell disease occurs in children <4 years old, and a history of ACS at this age is a risk factor for future ACS episodes. However, the interval associated with the highest risk of subsequent ACS or severe pain is not known. Through this mixed retrospective-prospective observational study, the Sleep and Asthma Cohort, we sought to determine the interval after an initial ACS episode during which the majority of children <4 years old are rehospitalized for ACS or severe pain. The cumulative prevalence of rehospitalization for ACS or severe pain within 6 months, 1 years, and 2 years was calculated for children with an initial ACS episode <4 years old and compared to children with an initial ACS episode >=4 years old. A total of 44.8% and 55.2% of participants had an initial ACS episode <4 years and >=4 years old (Range: 4-17.7 years), respectively. At 1 year following the initial ACS episode, children <4 years old had a significantly higher cumulative prevalence of rehospitalizations for ACS or pain as compared to children >=4 years of age, 62.5 and 39.1%, respectively (P = 0.009). After initial ACS episodes, the majority of children <4 years old will be rehospitalized for ACS or severe pain within one year, suggesting the need for a therapeutic intervention for this high-risk group.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the Child Opportunity Index (COI), a nationally available measure of relative educational, health/environmental, and social/economic opportunity across census tracts within metropolitan areas, is associated with population- and patient-level asthma morbidity., STUDY DESIGN: This population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted between 2011 and 2013 in a southwest Ohio county. Participants included all children aged 1-16 years with hospitalizations or emergency department visits for asthma or wheezing at a major pediatric hospital. Patients were identified using discharge diagnosis codes and geocoded to their home census tract. The primary population-level outcome was census tract asthma hospitalization rate. The primary patient-level outcome was rehospitalization within 12 months of the index hospitalization. Census tract opportunity was characterized using the COI and its educational, health/environmental, and social/economic domains., RESULTS: Across 222 in-county census tracts, there were 2539 geocoded hospitalizations. The median asthma-related hospitalization rate was 5.0 per 1000 children per year (IQR, 1.9-8.9). Median hospitalization rates in very low, low, moderate, high, and very high opportunity tracts were 9.1, 7.6, 4.6, 2.1, and 1.8 per 1000, respectively (P < .0001). The social/economic domain had the most variables significantly associated with the outcome at the population level. The adjusted patient-level analyses showed that the COI was not significantly associated with a patient's risk of rehospitalization within 12 months., CONCLUSIONS: The COI was associated with population-level asthma morbidity. The details provided by the COI may inform interventions aimed at increasing opportunity and reducing morbidity across regions. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Starting from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and World Health Organization (WHO) reports, this review provides an overview of the literature published from 2006 to 2017 on the associations between indoor mould exposure and asthma and rhinitis separately in children and adults with a focus on longitudinal epidemiological studies.A systematic search of peer-reviewed literature was performed, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses, longitudinal, incident case-control and panel studies. 61 publications were identified reporting visible mould or mould odour or quantitative assessment of culturable fungi or mould species.In children, visible mould and mould odour were associated with the development and exacerbations of asthma, providing sufficient evidence of a causal relationship. Results from population-based studies in adults were too few and divergent to conclude at more than a limited level of evidence. Exposure to mould in a work building was associated with the incidence and exacerbations of occupational asthma, and we concluded at a sufficient evidence for an association. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses and longitudinal studies on the relationships between mould exposure and allergic rhinitis provide sufficient evidence of an association.This review extended the conclusions of the IOM and WHO reports, and highlighted the need for further longitudinal studies on asthma in adults, and on rhinitis.

T1  - Early life insults as determinants of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adult life.
A1  - Savran, Osman
A1  - Ulrik, Charlotte Suppli
Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Background: Early life events may predispose to the development of chronic lung disease in adulthood., Aim: To provide an update on current knowledge of early nongenetic origins of COPD., Materials and methods: Systematic literature review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines., Results: A total of 16 studies, comprising 69,365 individuals, met the predefined criteria and were included in the present review. Studies have shown that in utero tobacco exposure, low birth weight, preterm birth, and respiratory diseases, primarily asthma and pneumonia, in early childhood are associated with lung function impairment later in childhood, and by that predispose to subsequent development of COPD, although the causal association between childhood respiratory diseases and COPD has been questioned in one study. Environmental tobacco exposure has also been shown to have negative impact on lung function in childhood possibly leading to COPD in adulthood, although it is at present not possible to clearly distinguish between the impact of active and the environmental tobacco exposure on subsequent development of COPD., Conclusion: Tobacco exposure in utero and early life is a risk factor for subsequent development of COPD. Furthermore, low birth weight, lower respiratory tract infections and asthma, including wheezy bronchitis, in childhood also seem to be important determinants for later development of COPD. Early life insults may, therefore, be crucial to COPD development.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Some human and animal studies have recently shown that maternal grandmother's smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of asthma in the grandchildren. We have investigated whether sex of the exposed parent and/or grandchild modifies the association between grandmaternal smoking and grandchild asthma., METHODS: We formed a cohort study based on linkage of national registries with prospectively collected data over three generations. Smoking habits in early pregnancy were registered since 1982 and purchases of prescribed medication since 2005. In all, 10 329 children born since 2005 had information on maternal and grandmaternal smoking on both sides and were followed from birth up to 6 years of age. Ages when medication was purchased were used to classify the cohort into never, early transient (0-3 years), early persistent (0-3 and 4-6 years), and late-onset (4-6 years) phenotypes of childhood asthma., RESULTS: Maternal grandmother's smoking was associated with an increased odds of early persistent asthma after adjustment for maternal smoking and other confounders (odds ratio 1.29, 95% confidence interval 1.10-1.51). Grandchild sex did not modify the association. Paternal grandmother's smoking was not associated with any of the asthma phenotypes., CONCLUSION: Maternal but not paternal exposure to nicotine before conception was related to an increased risk of early persistent childhood asthma, but not other asthma phenotypes. Our findings are possibly consistent with a sex-specific mode of epigenetic transfer. Copyright © 2018 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley and Sons Ltd.

N2  - Montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, was marketed in 1998 as an oral supplementary treatment to patients with mild to moderate asthma. The aim of this study was to describe the early discontinuation pattern among montelukast users in Denmark in the period of 1 March 1998 to 31 December 2016, and to identify demographic characteristics possibly associated with early discontinuation. This nationwide drug utilization study was based on data collected from three nationwide Danish registers. All montelukast users who redeemed at least one prescription in the study period were identified. Early discontinuation was defined as failing to fill a second prescription for montelukast within at least a year after the initial montelukast prescription. Among 135,271 included montelukast users, 47,480 (35%) discontinued the use of montelukast after a single redeemed prescription. The trend in early discontinuation increased throughout the years. The most predominant demographic risk factors for early discontinuation were prescription for only nasal topical anti-allergic treatment up to a year prior to montelukast initiation [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.25; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.13-2.38], as well as suspected off-label use (adjusted OR 2.02; 95% CI 1.97-2.08). Several risk factors were associated with a decreased risk of early discontinuation; most pronounced was a prescription of inhaled corticosteroids within a year up to montelukast initiation [adjusted OR 0.47 (95% CI 0.46-0.49)]. Early discontinuation was more pronounced after patent expiry in 2012 [adjusted OR 1.42 (95% CI 1.38-1.45)]. In conclusion, we found that early montelukast discontinuation increased during the last 19 years. Appropriateness of the treatment indication as estimated by concomitant prescription of adequate inhalation therapy was associated with a low risk of early discontinuation. A more pronounced early discontinuation was observed after patent expiry in 2012, which could reflect a more liberal approach to montelukast prescription.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Asthma is the most common chronic lung disease of childhood, affecting approximately 6 million children in the United States. Although asthma cannot be cured, most of the time, asthma symptoms can be controlled by avoiding or reducing exposure to asthma triggers (allergens and irritants) and by following recommendations for asthma education and appropriate medical care., METHODS: CDC analyzed asthma data from the 2001-2016 National Health Interview Survey for children aged 0-17 years to examine trends and demographic differences in health outcomes and health care use., RESULTS: Asthma was more prevalent among boys (9.2%) than among girls (7.4%), children aged >=5 years (approximately 10%) than children aged <5 years (3.8%), non-Hispanic black (black) children (15.7%) and children of Puerto Rican descent (12.9%) than among non-Hispanic white (white) children (7.1%), and children living in low income families (10.5%) than among those living in families with income >=250% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) (approximately 7%). Asthma prevalence among children increased from 8.7% in 2001 to 9.4% in 2010, and then decreased to 8.3% in 2016. Although not all changes were statistically significant, a similar pattern was observed among subdemographic groups studied, with the exception of Mexican/Mexican-American children, among whom asthma prevalence increased from 5.1% in 2001 to 6.5% in 2016. Among children with asthma, the percentage who had an asthma attack in the past 12 months declined significantly from 2001 to 2016. Whereas asthma prevalence was lower among children aged 0-4 years than among older children, the prevalence of asthma attacks (62.4%), emergency department or urgent care center (ED/UC) visits (31.1%), and hospitalization (10.4%) were higher among children with asthma aged 0-4 years than among those aged 12-17 years (44.8%, 9.6%, and 2.8%, respectively). During 2013, children with asthma aged 5-17 years missed 13.8 million days of school per year (2.6 days per child). Compared with 2003, in 2013, the prevalence of adverse health outcomes and health care use were significantly lower and the prevalence of having an action plan to manage asthma was higher., CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE: Asthma remains an important public health and medical problem. The health of children with asthma can be improved by promoting asthma control strategies, including asthma trigger reduction, appropriate guidelines-based medical management, and asthma education for children, parents, and others involved in asthma care.

N2  - BACKGROUND: We evaluated the effectiveness of different recruitment strategies used in a study aimed at eliminating/reducing second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure in Dutch children 0-13 years of age with a high risk of asthma., METHODS: The different strategies include: 1) questionnaires distributed via home addresses, physicians or schools of the children; 2) cohorts from other paediatric studies; 3) physicians working in the paediatric field (family physicians, paediatricians and Youth Health Care (YHC) physicians); and 4) advertisements in a local newsletter, at child-care facilities, and day-care centres., RESULTS: More than 42,782 families were approached to take part in the screening of which 3663 could be assessed for eligibility. Of these responders, 196 families met the inclusion criteria for the study. However, only 58 (one third) could be randomised in the trial, mainly because of no interest or time of the parents. The results showed that recruiting families who expose their children to SHS exposure is very challenging, which may be explained by lack of 'recognition' or awareness that SHS occurs in homes. The presence of asthma in the family, respiratory symptoms in the children, and even incentives did not increase parental motivation for participation in the study., CONCLUSIONS: The recruitment process for an intervention program addressing SHS exposure in children was considerably more challenging and time consuming than anticipated. Barriers at both a parents level and a doctor's level can be discriminated.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Children with early-onset atopic dermatitis (AD) are at substantial risk of developing asthma later in life, and identifying the critical window of detrimental exposure is advantageous for implementing preventive actions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of exposure to environmental modifiers during pregnancy and early childhood in asthma occurrence in an infantile AD cohort., METHODS: Eligible study participants were selected from the Taiwan Birth Cohort Study, which enrolled 24 200 newborns in 2005. We enrolled those cases who had been diagnosed as having AD before 3 years of age and followed them up till age 8. We excluded those ever diagnosed with asthma before AD onset. The dependent variable was defined in terms of whether the participant was diagnosed as having asthma before 8 years of age. We applied logistic regression models to evaluate the risks of exposure to different determinants in asthma occurrence., RESULTS: A total of 1549 children with AD had completed the 8-year follow-up, and 334 (21.6%) of them had asthma. The results revealed that male sex, lower birth order, maternal asthma history, maternal obesity before pregnancy, and environmental tobacco smoke exposure before 3 years of age were significant risk factors for further development of asthma. Furthermore, food allergy during early life, lower respiratory tract infection, and longer durations of symptomatic AD influenced asthma development later in life., CONCLUSIONS: The findings confirmed the critical determinants for asthma occurrence in infantile AD, which may enable a more personalized approach to the prevention of asthma.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Interleukin-17 (IL-17A) is a mainly pro-inflammatory cytokine, and IL-17 signaling implicates in the development of allergic asthma. The polymorphism rs2275913 in the promoter region of the IL-17A gene has in previous studies been associated with asthma susceptibility. The objective was to evaluate the association between IL-17A rs2275913 (-197G>A) polymorphism and post-bronchiolitis asthma and/or allergic rhinitis in a prospective 11-13 years post-bronchiolitis follow-up., METHODS: 166 previously healthy full-term infants, hospitalized for bronchiolitis at age less than 6 months, were invited to follow-up visits at the ages of 5-7 years and 11-13 years. Asthma diagnoses and presumptive symptoms, allergic rhinitis and use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) were registered. Blood samples for IL-17A rs2275913 (-197G>A) polymorphism were obtained during hospitalization or at the 5-7 years control visit., RESULTS: There were no significant differences between children with the wild GG and variant GA or AA genotype in the severity of bronchiolitis during hospitalization or in the outcomes until the age 5-7 years. At 11-13 years of age, children with the variant GA or AA genotype had significantly less often current asthma, use of ICSs during last 12 months or allergic rhinitis than those with the wild GG genotype. The ICS use during last 12 months retained the statistical significance in adjusted analyses (adjusted OR 0.25), whereas current asthma and allergic rhinitis marginally lost it., CONCLUSIONS: The IL-17A rs2275913 (-197G>A) polymorphism decreased the risk of post-bronchiolitis asthma at 11-13 years of age, but not earlier in life, in the present prospective, long-term follow-up study.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The association between AS (asthma) and dental caries is controversial, while that between allergic rhinitis (AR) and caries has not been established. This study aimed to verify the relationship among AR, AS and dental caries., DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study., SETTING: Data from Health Insurance Database of the Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database., PARTICIPANTS: Nine thousand and thirty-eight children born in 2004 were obtained. Their claims data were evaluated from birth to the age of 9 years., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The frequencies of clinical visits for dental caries were calculated for primary teeth (age 1-5) and for dental transitional period (age 6-9). Differences in the frequencies of clinical visits for caries in AR vs non-AR and AS vs non-AS children were compared. Correlation between AR, AS and caries frequencies was studied, and the influences of AR drugs on the development of caries were evaluated., RESULTS: After adjusting for confounding factors and AS case, the frequencies of clinical visits for caries were higher in AR (increased by 13%-25% and P<.001 at different age periods). The AR frequencies significantly correlated with caries frequencies in children with AR. Different AR drugs also correlated with caries formation. After adjusting for confounding factors and AR case, there was no relationship between AS and caries in children., CONCLUSION: Asthma is not associated with dental caries, but AR can increase the frequency of clinical visits for caries. Medications for AR may also play a role in caries formation. Thus, AR may be a risk factor for childhood dental caries. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Oral corticosteroids (OCS) are a mainstay of treatment for asthma exacerbations, and short-term OCS courses were generally considered to be safe. Nevertheless, frequent short-term OCS courses could lead to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction. Our study aimed at investigating the integrity of the HPA axis in children with persistent asthma or recurrent wheezing at the beginning of an inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) trial., METHOD: Morning basal cortisol was assessed just before the beginning of ICS, and 30, 60, and 90 days later, using Immulite Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostic chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (Los Angeles, USA; 2006)., RESULTS: In all, 140 children (0.3-15 years old) with persistent asthma or recurrent wheezing have been evaluated and 40% of them reported short-term OCS courses for up to 30 days before evaluation. Out of these, 12.5% had biochemical adrenal suppression but showed adrenal recovery during a three-month ICS trial treatment. No significant differences were observed among children with or without adrenal suppression, neither in the number of days free of OCS treatment before cortisol evaluation (p=0.29) nor in the last OCS course duration (p=0.20). The number of short-term OCS courses reported in the year preceding the cortisol evaluation was also not different (p=0.89)., CONCLUSION: Short-term systemic courses of corticosteroids at conventional doses can put children at risk of HPA axis dysfunction. ICS treatment does not impair adrenal recovery from occurring. Health practitioners should be aware of the risk of a blunted cortisol response upon exposure to stress during the follow-up of patients with persistent asthma or recurrent wheezing.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Sensitization to both inhalant and food allergens has been shown to be risk factors for development of asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis (RC). However, few studies have addressed the role of transient or persistent IgE sensitization to specific allergens in early life for later development of allergic diseases. The aim of this study was to explore the association between transient and persistent sensitization in early life and the development of asthma and RC at 6 and 14 years., METHODS: The Danish Allergy Research Center (DARC) cohort is a prospective non-interventional birth cohort study comprising 562 children. For the purpose of this study, we examined a subgroup of the original cohort with specific IgE measured at, at least 3 of 4 follow-ups between 3 and 18 months of age (n = 366). Multiple logistic regression models were used to investigate the association between transient and persistent early-life sensitization to groups of and to individual allergens and asthma and RC at 6 and 14 years compared to a reference group with no sensitization., RESULTS: Both transient early-life sensitization and persistent early-life sensitization to cow's milk or hen's egg proteins were associated with asthma (aOR 3.99[1.41-11.32] and 5.95[1.78-19.92]) and RC (aOR 2.94[1.19-7.28] and 6.18[1.86-20.53]) at 14 years, this association being driven mainly by sensitization to hen's egg. Transient early-life sensitization to house dust mite (HDM) had increased risk of asthma (aOR 3.80[1.17-12.41]) at 14 years., CONCLUSIONS: Early transient IgE sensitization and persistent IgE sensitization to hen's egg were associated with asthma and RC at 14 years. Furthermore, sensitization to HDM was associated with asthma at 14 years. Copyright © 2017 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley and Sons Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Helminth infections, common in low-income countries, may protect against allergy-related disease. Early exposure may be a key. In the Entebbe Mother and Baby Study, treating helminths during pregnancy resulted in increased eczema rates in early childhood. We followed the cohort to determine whether this translated to increased asthma rates at school age., METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, conducted in Entebbe, Uganda, had three interventions. During pregnancy, women were randomized, simultaneously, to albendazole vs placebo and to praziquantel vs placebo. Their children were independently randomized to quarterly albendazole vs placebo from age 15 months to 5 years. We here report follow-up to age 9 years. Primary outcomes at 9 years were recent reported wheeze, skin prick test positivity (SPT) to common allergens and allergen-specific IgE positivity to dust mite or cockroach. Secondary outcomes were doctor-diagnosed asthma and eczema rates between 5 and 9 years, recent eczema, rhinitis and urticaria at 9 years, and SPT and IgE responses to individual allergens., RESULTS: 2507 pregnant women were enrolled; 1215 children were seen at age nine, of whom 1188 are included in this analysis. Reported wheeze was rare at 9 years (3.7%) while SPT positivity (25.0%) and IgE positivity (44.1%) were common. There was no evidence of a treatment effect for any of the three interventions on any of the primary outcomes., CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal and early-life treatment of helminths, in the absence of change in other exposures, is unlikely to increase the risk of atopic diseases later in childhood in this tropical, low-income setting.

N2  - Asthma and croup are common inflammatory airway diseases involving the bronchus in children. However, no study has reported the effects of urbanization, sex, age, and bronchiolitis on the association of croup and its duration with asthma development. We used the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database (LHID) to perform this population-based cohort study; here, the cluster effect caused by hospitalization was considered to evaluate the association between croup and asthma development and the risk factors for asthma in children of different age groups. We evaluated children with croup aged <12 years (n = 1204) and age-matched control patients (n = 140,887) by using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis within a hospitalization cluster. Of all 142,091 patients, 5799 (including 155 with croup [419 per 1000 person-y] and 5644 controls [106 per 1000 person-y]) had asthma during the 5-year follow-up period. During the 5-year follow-up period, the hazard ratios (HRs [95% CIs]) for asthma were 2.10 (1.81-2.44) in all children with croup, 2.13 (1.85-2.46) in those aged 0 to 5 years, and 2.22 (1.87-2.65) in those aged 6 to 12 years. Children with croup aged 7 to 9 years had a higher HR for asthma than did those in other age groups. Boys with croup had a higher HR for asthma. The adjusted HR for asthma was 1.78 times higher in children with croup living in urban areas than in those living in rural areas. In conclusion, our analyses indicated that sex, age, bronchiolitis, and urbanization level are significantly associated with croup and asthma development. According to our cumulative hazard rate curves, younger children with croup should be closely monitored for asthma development for at least 3 years.

N2  - Several studies have found an association between overweight and asthma, yet the temporal relationship between their onsets remains unclear. We investigated the development of body mass index (BMI) from birth to adolescence among 2,818 children with and without asthma from a Swedish birth cohort study, the BAMSE (a Swedish acronym for "children, allergy, milieu, Stockholm, epidemiology") Project, during 1994-2013. Measured weight and height were available at 13 time points throughout childhood. Asthma phenotypes (transient, persistent, and late-onset) were defined by timing of onset and remission. Quantile regression was used to analyze percentiles of BMI, and generalized estimating equations were used to analyze the association between asthma phenotypes and the risk of high BMI. Among females, BMI development differed between children with and without asthma, with the highest BMI being seen among females with persistent asthma. The difference existed throughout childhood but increased with age. For example, females with persistent asthma had 2.33 times' (95% confidence interval: 1.21, 4.49) greater odds of having a BMI above the 85th percentile at age >=15 years than females without asthma. Among males, no clear associations between asthma and BMI were observed. In this study, persistent asthma was associated with high BMI throughout childhood among females, whereas no consistent association was observed among males. Copyright © The Author(s) 2017.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis is associated with other allergic conditions, but variations in this "atopic march" are poorly understood., OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of the age of atopic dermatitis onset on the risk for asthma and seasonal allergies., METHODS: A cohort study was performed using the Pediatric Eczema Elective Registry, which is an observational cohort of subjects with pediatric onset atopic dermatitis., RESULTS: In total, 3966 children were included, and 73% reported atopic dermatitis onset before age 2 years. At baseline, subjects with atopic dermatitis onset at ages 3 to 7 or 8 to 17 years had significantly lower rates of seasonal allergies and asthma than those with onset before age 2. During follow-up, the adjusted relative risks for incident seasonal allergies were 0.82 (95% confidence interval, 0.72-0.91) and 0.64 (95% CI confidence interval, 0.47-0.83) in the 3- to 7- and 8- to 17-years-old at onset groups compared with the age 2 years or younger at onset group. The adjusted risk for incident asthma was not significantly different between the older onset groups and the earliest onset group., LIMITATIONS: Misclassification bias may arise from using self-reported onset age data., CONCLUSIONS: The timing of atopic dermatitis onset may explain part of the variation in the atopic march. These findings may improve future risk stratification of patients for treatment. Copyright © 2017 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: We undertake this study to understand patterns of pediatric asthma-related acute care use to inform interventions aimed at reducing potentially avoidable hospitalizations., METHODS: Hospital claims data from 3 Camden city facilities for 2010 to 2014 were used to perform cluster analysis classifying patients aged 0 to 17 years according to their asthma-related hospital use. Clusters were based on 2 variables: asthma-related ED visits and hospitalizations. Demographics and a number of sociobehavioral and use characteristics were compared across clusters., RESULTS: Children who met the criteria (3,170) were included in the analysis. An examination of a scree plot showing the decline in within-cluster heterogeneity as the number of clusters increased confirmed that clusters of pediatric asthma patients according to hospital use exist in the data. Five clusters of patients with distinct asthma-related acute care use patterns were observed. Cluster 1 (62% of patients) showed the lowest rates of acute care use. These patients were least likely to have a mental health-related diagnosis, were less likely to have visited multiple facilities, and had no hospitalizations for asthma. Cluster 2 (19% of patients) had a low number of asthma ED visits and onetime hospitalization. Cluster 3 (11% of patients) had a high number of ED visits and low hospitalization rates, and the highest rates of multiple facility use. Cluster 4 (7% of patients) had moderate ED use for both asthma and other illnesses, and high rates of asthma hospitalizations; nearly one quarter received care at all facilities, and 1 in 10 had a mental health diagnosis. Cluster 5 (1% of patients) had extreme rates of acute care use., CONCLUSION: Differences observed between groups across multiple sociobehavioral factors suggest these clusters may represent children who differ along multiple dimensions, in addition to patterns of service use, with implications for tailored interventions.

N2  - PURPOSE: An association between childhood allergic disease and parental psychological disorders has been reported. However, little is known about the relationship between childhood allergic disease and maternal depression. This study was performed to determine if there is an association between childhood allergic disease and maternal depression., METHODS: Data were acquired from 13,782 subjects (8091 mothers) ages < 18 years who participated in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, which was conducted from 2007 to 2014. The presence of allergic disease (asthma or atopic dermatitis) and depression was based on self-reported physician diagnosis in the health interview surveys., RESULTS: Logistic regression analyses showed maternal depression was significantly associated with single marital status (separated or divorced, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.204 [95% confidence interval {CI},1.256-3.867]), less than middle school graduated level (aOR 2.959 [95% CI, 1.514-5.781]), middle school graduated educational level (aOR 2.420 [95% CI, 1.355-4.319]), being a current smoker (aOR 2.257 [95% CI, 1.481-3.438]), being an ex-smoker (aOR 2.533 [95% CI, 1.506-4.260]), maternal asthma (aOR 2.786 [95% CI, 1.453-5.344]), and maternal hypertension (aOR 1.942 [95% CI, 1.106-3.408]). Maternal depression was significantly associated with children's asthma (aOR 2.028 [95% CI, 1.234-3.335]) and children's atopic dermatitis (aOR 1.755 [95% CI, 1.183-2.602])., CONCLUSION: The present study showed maternal depression might be a risk factor for the clinical diagnosis of asthma and atopic dermatitis in Korean children.

N2  - The growing prevalence of childhood obesity has become a serious health problem over the past decades. As the immune system is greatly affected by excess weight, in this review of reviews, we discuss the findings of review articles about the relationship between childhood/maternal obesity and children's immune system. We searched English-language articles in PubMed, Scopus, ISI Thomson Reuters, and Google Scholar databases. All relevant reviews, either systematic or narrative, were retrieved. Then their quality was assessed by using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews and International Narrative Systematic Assessment tools, respectively. In the final step, 26 reviews were included. Our review suggests that childhood obesity is associated with extensive changes in the serum levels of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and proteins, as well as the number of immune cells and their behavior. Therefore, it might cause or exacerbate diseases such as asthma, allergy, atopic dermatitis (AD), and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Moreover, childhood obesity may reduce the immune system responsiveness to vaccines and microorganisms. Furthermore, studies suggest that maternal obesity increases the risk of asthma in offspring. Future studies are needed to determine different associations of childhood obesity with allergy, atophic dermatitis, and autoimmune diseases.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Being born large for gestational age (LGA) is a marker of increased growth velocity in fetal life and a risk factor for childhood overweight. Both being born LGA and childhood overweight may influence the development of asthma, although the role of overweight in the association between LGA and childhood asthma is unclear. Importantly, recent studies have suggested that the association between overweight and asthma may be related to non-allergic pathways. If this also applies to the association between LGA and asthma, the association between being born LGA and asthma may be different for atopic and non-atopic children., OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association of being LGA with the prevalence of asthma at age 8 in atopic and non-atopic children and the role of overweight in this association., METHODS: Complete data on asthma, anthropometry and atopy at age of 8 years, and potential confounders were available for 1608 participants of the PIAMA birth cohort. Odds ratios for the association between LGA and asthma in atopic and non-atopic children were estimated by logistic regression analysis adjusting for potential confounders. Overweight was assessed as a potential modifier of the association between LGA and asthma., RESULTS: Being born LGA was not significantly associated with asthma at age of 8 in atopic and non-atopic children. However, overweight at age of 8 years modified the association between asthma at age of 8 and LGA. In non-atopic children, children who were born LGA and were overweight at age of 8 years had a significantly increased odds of asthma compared to non-LGA, non-overweight children (adj OR 7.04; 95% CI 2.2-24)., CONCLUSIONS: We observed that non-atopic children born LGA, who were overweight by 8 years have an increased risk of asthma. If confirmed, these findings suggest that non-atopic children born LGA may be identified early in life as a high-risk group for asthma. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - INTRODUCTION: Childhood respiratory illness is a major cause of morbidity and mortality particularly in low and middle-income countries. Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure is a recognised risk factor for both acute and chronic respiratory illness. Areas covered: The aim of this paper was to review the epidemiology of ETS exposure and impact on respiratory health in children. We conducted a search of 3 electronic databases of publications on ETS and childhood respiratory illness from 1990-2015. Key findings were that up to 70% of children are exposed to ETS globally, but under-reporting may mask the true prevalence. Maternal smoking and ETS exposure influence infant lung development and are associated with childhood upper and lower respiratory tract infection, wheezing or asthma. Further, exposure to ETS is associated with more severe respiratory disease. ETS exposure reduces lung function early in life, establishing an increased lifelong risk of poor lung health. Expert commentary: Urgent and effective strategies are needed to decrease ETS exposure in young children to improve child and long-term lung health in adults especially in low and middle income countries where ETS exposure is increasing.

N2  - We estimated the association between bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination and childhood asthma in a birth cohort using administrative databases, and we determined the impact of adjusting for potential confounders collected from a subset of the cohort members. Data were collected in 2 waves: 1) Administrative data for 76,623 individuals (stage 1) was gathered from the Quebec Birth Cohort on Immunity and Health (1974-1994), including BCG vaccination status, perinatal and sociodemographic characteristics, and use of health services for asthma; and 2) self-reported asthma risk factors were collected in 2012 by telephone interviews with 1,643 participants (stage 2) using a balanced 2-stage sampling design. We estimated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for asthma using logistic regression and correcting for the known sampling fractions from stage 1 to stage 2, overall and sex-stratified. In total, 35,612 (46.5%) individuals were BCG vaccinated, and 5,870 (7.7%) had asthma. The final odds ratio, integrating results from both stages of sampling, was 0.95 (95% confidence interval: 0.87, 1.04). Results did not differ according to sex (P for interaction = 0.327). To our knowledge, this is the largest study ever conducted on this topic, and using the best possible comprehensive adjustment for confounders, we found no association between BCG vaccination and asthma.

Studies assessing the influence of early life antibiotic use on the risk of asthma exacerbations are limited, and the results are inconsistent. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the association between use of antibiotic during the first 3 years of life and the risk of developing childhood asthma and the occurrence of asthma exacerbations., METHODS: Data from four large childhood cohorts were used; two population-based cohorts to study the risk of developing asthma: Generation R (n=7393, The Netherlands) and SEATON (n=891, Scotland, UK), and two asthma cohorts to assess the risk of asthma exacerbations: PACMAN (n=668, The Netherlands) and BREATHE (n=806, Scotland, UK). Odds ratios (ORs) were derived from logistic regression analysis within each database followed by pooling the results using a fixed- or random-effect model., RESULTS: Antibiotic use in early life was associated with an increased risk of asthma in a meta-analysis of the Generation R and SEATON data (OR: 2.18, 95% CI: 1.04-4.60; I2 : 76.3%). There was no association between antibiotic use in early life and risk of asthma exacerbations later in life in a meta-analysis of the PACMAN and BREATHE data (OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.65-1.32; I2 : 0.0%)., CONCLUSION: Children treated with antibiotic in the first 3 years of life are more likely to develop asthma, but there is no evidence that the exposure to antibiotic is associated with increased risk of asthma exacerbations.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Assessment tools to classify and prioritize patients, such as systems of triage, and indicators of severity, such as clinical respiratory scores, are helpful in guiding the flow of asthmatic patients in the emergency department., OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to assess the performance of the Pediatric Assessment Triangle (PAT), triage level (TL), Pulmonary Score (PS), and initial O2 saturation (O2 sat), in predicting hospitalization in pediatric acute asthma exacerbations., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study evaluating PAT, TL, and PS at presentation, and initial O2 sat of asthmatic children in the pediatric emergency department (PED). The primary outcome measure was the rate of hospitalization. Secondary outcomes were length of stay (LOS) in the PED and admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU)., RESULTS: PAT, TL, PS, and initial O2 sat were recorded in 14,953 asthmatic children. Multivariate analysis yielded the following results: Abnormal PAT and more severe TLs (I-II) were independent risk factors for hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] 1.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-1.8; OR 3.4, 95% CI 2.6-4.3, respectively) and longer LOS (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.7; OR 2.6, 95% CI 2-3.3, respectively). PS > 3 showed a strong association with hospitalization (OR 8.1, 95% CI 7-9.4), PICU admission (OR 9.6, 95% CI 3-30.9) and longer LOS (OR 6.2, 95% CI 5.6-6.9). O2 sat < 94% was an independent predictor of admission (OR 5.2, 95% CI 4.6-5.9), PICU admission (OR 4.6, 95% CI 4.5-4.6), and longer LOS (OR 4.6, 95% CI 4.1-5.2)., CONCLUSIONS: PAT, TL, PS, and initial O2 sat are good predictors of hospitalization in pediatric acute asthma exacerbations.

N2  - BACKGROUNDS: Literatures regarding the effects of childhood asthma on the risk of herpes zoster (HZ) is very limited. The aim of this study is to investigate the risks of children developing HZ with asthma., METHODS: From the National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified 300,649 patients who had asthma between 2000 and 2007 as an asthma cohort. We identified another matched non-asthma cohort. All subjects were followed until the end of 2008. A Cox model was used to estimate the association of asthma on the risk of HZ., RESULTS: Asthma cohort had significantly higher risk of developing HZ than the comparison cohort (HR=1.15; 95 % CI =1.06-1.26). However, compared to those without regular controller, asthma cohort with regular inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment had slightly increased risk for HZ (HR=1.14; 95% CI=1.01-1.27) but decreased risk for HZ in those with regular combined ICS and Montelukast (HR=0.83; 95% CI=0.69-0.98). Uncontrolled asthma with more than 3-4 times ED visits and admissions per year had 3.72 (CI =1.86-7.47) and 20.5 (CI =10.2-41.2) greater risks for HZ than those without asthma, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Asthma poses an increased risk of zoster, therefore control of asthma is important to minimize risk of HZ.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have demonstrated that a coding SNP (rs6967330, Cys529->Tyr) in cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3), which was previously associated with wheezing illness and hospitalizations in infancy, could support efficient human rhinovirus C (RV-C) entry and replication. Here, we sought to examine the genetic contribution of this variant to the development of adult asthma., METHODS: We performed a candidate gene case-control association study of 2 independent Japanese populations (a total of 3366 adults). The odds ratios (ORs) for association of the A allele at rs6967330 with adult asthma were calculated according to age at onset of asthma. In addition, the effect of the CDHR3 genotype on the development of specific asthma phenotypes was examined., RESULTS: The A allele was associated with asthma (OR = 1.56; Mantel-Haenszel p = 0.0040) when the analysis was limited to patients with early-onset adult asthma. In addition, when the analysis was limited to atopic individuals, a stronger association of the CDHR3 variant with early-onset asthma was found, and interaction of the CDHR3 genotype with atopy was demonstrated. Finally, a significant association of this variant was specifically found with a phenotype of asthma characterized by atopy, early-onset, and lower lung function., CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the concept that the CDHR3 variant is an important susceptibility factor for severe adult asthma in individuals who develop the disease in early life. The interaction between the CDHR3 variant and atopy indicates that genetic predisposition to early respiratory viral infection is combined with atopy in promoting asthma.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Question A child with a history of asthma came to my clinic with acute fever. I have heard that acetaminophen might be associated with exacerbation of asthma. Is it safe if I recommend acetaminophen for this child? Answer Most studies suggest an association between acetaminophen use in children and development of asthma later in childhood. However, several confounding factors in study design might contribute to this positive correlation, and without a prospective controlled trial, confirming this finding is challenging. If children have a known history of asthma, it is likely safe to administer a single dose of acetaminophen without concern of precipitating adverse respiratory symptoms. Regular use of acetaminophen to relieve fever or pain does not seem to exacerbate asthma in children more than ibuprofen does. Copyright© the College of Family Physicians of Canada.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Uncontrolled asthma decreases quality of life and increases health care use. Most people with asthma need daily use of long-term control (LTC) medications for asthma symptoms and to prevent asthma attacks. Ongoing assessment of a person's level of asthma control and medication use is important in determining the effectiveness of current treatment to decrease the frequency and intensity of symptoms and functional limitations., OBJECTIVE: To assess the use of LTC medication among children and adults with current asthma and identify contributing factors for LTC medication use., METHODS: We used the 2006-2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) child and adult Asthma Call-back Survey (ACBS) data to assess the level of asthma control and LTC medication use. Asthma control was classified as well controlled and uncontrolled using guideline-based measures. We used multivariable logistic regression models to identify contributing factors for LTC medication use and having uncontrolled asthma., RESULTS: Among persons with current asthma, 46.0% of children and 41.5% of adults were taking LTC medications and 38.4% of children and 50.0% of adults had uncontrolled asthma. Among children who had uncontrolled asthma (38.4%), 24.1% were taking LTC medications and 14.3% were not taking LTC medications. Among adults who had uncontrolled asthma (50.0%), 26.7% were taking LTC medications and 23.3% were not taking LTC medications., CONCLUSIONS: Using BRFSS ACBS data to assess the level of asthma control and LTC medication use can identify subpopulations of persons with asthma who receive suboptimal treatment, for which better asthma-related medical treatment and management are needed.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although results of many studies have indicated an increased risk of asthma in former late preterm (LPT) infants, most of these studies did not fully address covariate imbalance., OBJECTIVE: To compare the cumulative frequency of asthma in a population-based cohort of former LPT infants to that of matched term infants in their early childhood, when accounting for covariate imbalance., METHODS: From a population-based birth cohort of children born 2002-2006 in Olmsted County, Minnesota, we assessed a random sample of LPT (34 to 36 6/7 weeks) and frequency-matched term (37 to 40 6/7 weeks) infants. The subjects were followed-up through 2010 or censored based on the last date of contact, with the asthma status based on predetermined criteria. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the cumulative incidence of asthma during the study period. Cox models were used to estimate the hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval for the risk of asthma, when adjusting for potential confounders., RESULTS: LPT infants (n = 282) had a higher cumulative frequency of asthma than did term infants (n = 297), 29.9 versus 19.5%, respectively; p = 0.01. After adjusting for covariates associated with the risk of asthma, an LPT birth was not associated with a risk of asthma, whereas maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with a risk of asthma., CONCLUSION: LPT birth was not independently associated with a risk of asthma and other atopic conditions. Clinicians should make an effort to reduce exposure to smoking during pregnancy as a modifiable risk factor for asthma.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - BACKGROUND: In developed Western settings, asthma is more prevalent among second-generation compared to first-generation migrants. However, these studies are difficult to interpret as they include migrants of various ethnicities and countries of origin., OBJECTIVE: We assessed the association of parental migrant status with wheezing disorders among children born in Hong Kong, a developed non-Western setting, where many children have migrant parents from mainland China of the same ethnicity., METHODS: We used Cox regression to examine the adjusted associations of parental migrant status with time to first public hospital admission for asthma, bronchitis and bronchiolitis (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Version Clinical Modification 466, 490 and 493) from 9 days to 12 years in a population-representative birth cohort of 8327 Chinese children in Hong Kong., RESULTS: Having both parents as migrants was associated with higher risk of hospitalization for asthma and other wheezing disorders, compared to both parents being Hong Kong born (hazard ratio 1.30, 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.60 from 9 days to 6 years), adjusted for type of hospital at birth, parental history of allergies, mother's age at birth, father's age at birth and highest parental education., CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In the unique, non-Western context of Hong Kong, second-generation migrants had higher risk of hospitalization for childhood wheezing disorders compared to the native population, particularly before 6 years of age. Further study is required to clarify the underlying mechanisms involved. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

T1  - Childhood asthma is a risk factor for the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
A1  - McGeachie, Michael J
Y1  - 2017//
N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review will catalog the many recent longitudinal studies that have investigated the relationship between asthma and lung function, or the persistence and trajectories of lung function deficits., RECENT FINDINGS: Recent work has reported on 50-year follow-ups of some prominent population cohorts. A history of asthma confers a 10-30-fold risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Individuals reaching a reduced maximum growth of forced expiratory volume in 1 s in early adulthood are at risk for early or more severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)., SUMMARY: Taken together, there is a wealth of overlapping cohort studies of lung function, asthma and COPD. These show that asthma is associated with reduced lung function, which may start in infancy or prenatally, persists through childhood and adulthood and predisposes for early or more severe COPD.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To study the association of the risk factors during maternal pregnancy and the neonatal period with childhood bronchial asthma., METHODS: A total of 306 children with asthma (asthma group) and 250 healthy children (control group) were enrolled. Their clinical data during the neonatal period and the maternal data during pregnancy were retrospectively studied., RESULTS: The univariate analysis showed that there were significant differences in the rates of maternal use of antibiotics during pregnancy, use of antibiotics and probiotics during the neonatal period, preterm birth, cesarean section, low birth weight, and breast feeding (>6 months) between the asthma and control groups (P<0.05). The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that use of antibiotics during pregnancy (OR=3.908, 95%CI: 1.277-11.962), use of antibiotics during neonatal period (OR=24.154, 95%CI: 7.864-74.183), preterm birth (OR=8.535, 95%CI: 2.733-26.652), and cesarean section (OR=4.588, 95%CI: 2.887-7.291) were independent risk factors for childhood asthma. The use of probiotics during the neonatal period (OR=0.014, 95%CI: 0.004-0.046) and breast feeding (>6 months) (OR=0.161, 95%CI: 0.103-0.253) were protective factors for childhood asthma., CONCLUSIONS: The early prevention of childhood asthma can be improved by reducing the use of antibiotics during pregnancy, reducing cesarean section, avoiding abuse of antibiotics during the neonatal period, trying breast feeding and taking probiotics in early stage.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The association between asthma and swimming pool attendance has not been demonstrated and currently there are conflicting results. In order to clarify the association between asthma diagnosis in children and swimming pool attendance, and to assess the consistency of the available epidemiological studies, we completed a literature analysis on the relationship between the exposure to disinfection by-products in indoor swimming pools during childhood and asthma diagnosis., METHODS: Following the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria, a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed by searching MEDLINE via PubMed, TOXNET, and Scopus databases (from inception to 20 April 2015) using the key word "Asthma" together with "swimming pool", "disinfection by-products", "indoor air pollution" and "children". Inclusion criteria were: English language, a complete analytic study design involving a cohort of children (0-16 years), a well-defined definition of exposure, and the presence of data on effect and variance. Studies on in vivo, in vitro or professional and accidental exposure were excluded., RESULTS: After a screening process, seven reports (n = 5851 subjects) were included out of a total of 2928 references. The reported OR of the association between swimming pool attendance and asthma prevalence ranged from 0.58 to 2.30. The present meta-analysis failed to identify a significant difference in asthma development between children attending swimming pools and controls (OR, 1.084; 95% CI: 0.89-1.31)., CONCLUSIONS: Swimming in childhood does not increase the likelihood of doctor-diagnosed asthma. Based on this meta-analysis review, the association of the disease with indoor pool attendance is still unclear. Copyright © 2016 Japan Pediatric Society.

N2  - BACKGROUND: While there is evidence of an association between caesarean birth and increased asthma in children in high-income countries, it is unknown whether this association exists in low-to-middle-income countries (LMICs). We investigated whether children born through caesarean in India and Vietnam are at increased risk of caregiver-reported asthma by 8 years of age., METHODS: Data from an ongoing multi-national longitudinal cohort study (the Young Lives Study) in two LMICs (India n = 2026; Vietnam n = 2000) were used. Caregiver questionnaires captured information on caregiver-reported long-term respiratory problems such as asthma or wheeze at age 8 years, birth mode and a range of sociodemographic factors. Multivariable logistic regression models using propensity score adjustment were used to explore birth mode and asthma at age 8 years adjusted for a range of known confounders., RESULTS: Children delivered by caesarean in India (odds ratio (OR) 2.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3, 5.4) and Vietnam (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2, 3.3) had greater odds of asthma at age 8 years, after adjustment for other risk factors including wealth, liveborn parity, low birthweight, geographic location, cooking fuel used, livestock ownership, household size, housing quality and parental smoking., CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that caesarean birth may be associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma in India and Vietnam. The underlying mechanisms of this finding need to be further elucidated. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To explore the relationship between lower airway disease and postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea among patients undergoing pituitary surgery STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review., METHODS: A retrospective review of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's 2013 National Inpatient Sample was conducted to characterize the hospital stay and surgical outcomes of patients undergoing pituitary surgery. Patients with lower airway disease (including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma) were compared to a disease-free population identifying demographics and complications over-represented in the lower airway group., RESULTS: The majority of hypophysectomies (92.1%) were performed via a transsphenoidal approach. Among transsphenoidal patients, individuals with asthma (92.8% of the lower airway disease cohort) harbored a greater postoperative CSF leak rate (4.7% vs. 2.7%, P = .022), and were more likely to develop postoperative diabetes insipidus (6.2% vs. 4.1%, P = .024) and neurological complications (13.0% vs. 9.6%, P = .010) when compared to a lower airway disease-free cohort. Patients with CSF rhinorrhea had longer lengths of stay (7.8 days vs. 4.5 days, P < .001) and higher discharge costs ($148,309 vs. $76,246, P < .001). A binary logistic regression model identified having asthma (P = .042), being female (P = .011), and having gastroesophageal reflux disease (P = .006) as independent predictors of postoperative CSF rhinorrhea., CONCLUSIONS: Several patient comorbidities including asthma are associated with a greater risk of postoperative CSF rhinorrhea. Perioperative lower airway assessment and disease control may potentially decrease one's risk of this complication, although further inquiry is urgently needed to identify optimal preventive strategies., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2c.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether asthma is associated with risk of appendicitis in children., METHODS: We used a population-based case-control study design using a comprehensive medical record review and predetermined criteria for appendicitis and asthma. All children (age younger than 18 years of age) who resided in Olmsted County, Minnesota, and developed appendicitis between 2006 and 2012 were matched to controls (1:1) with regard to birthday, gender, registration date, and index date. Asthma status was ascertained using predetermined criteria. Active (current) asthma was defined as the presence of asthma symptoms or asthma-related events (eg, medication use, clinic visits, emergency department, or hospitalization) within 1 year before the index date. Inactive asthma was defined as subjects without these events. A conditional logistic regression model was used., RESULTS: Among the 309 appendicitis cases identified, when stratified according to asthma status, active asthma was associated with significantly increased risk of appendicitis compared with inactive asthma (odds ratio [OR] = 2.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-5.03) and to no asthma (OR = 1.88; 95% CI, 1.07-3.27; overall P = .035). When controlling for potential confounders such as gender, age, and smoking status, active asthma was associated with a higher odds of developing appendicitis compared with nonasthmatic patients (adjusted OR = 1.75; 95% CI, 0.99-3.11) whereas inactive asthma was not (overall P = .049). Tobacco smoke exposure within 3 months was associated with an increased risk of appendicitis (adjusted OR = 1.66; 95% CI, 1.02-2.69). Among asthma medications, leukotriene receptor antagonists reduced the risk of appendicitis (OR = 0.18; 95% CI, 0.04-0.74)., CONCLUSIONS: Active asthma might be an unrecognized risk factor for appendicitis in children whereas a history of inactive asthma does not pose such risk. Further investigation exploring the underlying mechanisms is warranted. Copyright © 2016 Academic Pediatric Association. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Exposure to moldy or damp indoor environments is associated with allergic disease in young children, but it is unclear whether the effects persist to adolescence. Our objective was to assess whether exposure to mold or dampness during infancy increases the risk of asthma, rhinitis, or IgE sensitization in children followed from birth to 16 years of age., METHODS: We collected questionnaire derived reports of mold or dampness indicators and allergic outcomes from 3798 children in a Swedish birth cohort (BAMSE). Sensitization was assessed from blood samples in 3293 children. Longitudinal associations between prevalent asthma, rhinitis, and IgE sensitization and mold or dampness indicators were assessed using generalized estimating equations., RESULTS: Exposure to any mold or dampness indicator was associated with asthma up to 16 years of age (OR 1.31; 95% CI 1.08-1.59), while exposure to mold odor (OR 1.29; 95% CI 1.03-1.62) and visible mold (OR 1.28; 95% CI 1.04-1.58) were associated with rhinitis. Increased risks were observed for nonallergic asthma (OR 1.80; 95% CI 1.27-2.55) and rhinitis (OR 1.41; 95% CI 1.03-1.93). No association was observed between mold or dampness indicators and IgE sensitization. Exposure to any mold or dampness indicator was associated with persistent asthma (OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.20-2.50), but not with early-transient or late-onset asthma., CONCLUSION: Exposure to mold or dampness during infancy increased the risk of asthma and rhinitis up to 16 years of age, particularly for nonallergic disease. Early exposure to mold or dampness appeared particularly associated with persistent asthma through adolescence. Copyright © 2016 The Authors. Allergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The evolution of the IgE response to the numerous allergen molecules of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus is still unknown., OBJECTIVES: We sought to characterize the evolutionary patterns of the IgE response to 12 molecules of D pteronyssinus from birth to adulthood and to investigate their determinants and clinical relevance., METHODS: We investigated the clinical data and sera of 722 participants in the German Multicenter Allergy Study, a birth cohort started in 1990. Diagnoses of current allergic rhinitis (AR) related to mite allergy and asthma were based on yearly interviews at the ages of 1 to 13 years and 20 years. IgE to the extract and 12 molecules of D pteronyssinus were tested by means of ImmunoCAP and microarray technology, respectively, in sera collected at ages 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 13, and 20 years. Exposure to mites at age 6 and 18 months was assessed by measuring Der p 1 weight/weight concentration in house dust., RESULTS: One hundred ninety-one (26.5%) of 722 participants ever had IgE to D pteronyssinus extract (>=0.35 kUA/L). At age 20 years, their IgE recognized most frequently Der p 2, Der p 1, and Der p 23 (group A molecules; prevalence, >40%), followed by Der p 5, Der p 7, Der p 4, and Der p 21 (group B molecules; prevalence, 15% to 30%) and Der p 11, Der p 18, clone 16, Der p 14, and Der p 15 (group C molecules; prevalence, <10%). IgE sensitization started almost invariably with group A molecules and expanded sequentially first to group B and finally to group C molecules. Early IgE sensitization onset, parental hay fever, and higher exposure to mites were associated with a broader polymolecular IgE sensitization pattern. Participants reaching the broadest IgE sensitization stage (ie, ABC) had significantly higher risk of mite-related AR and asthma than unsensitized participants. IgE to Der p 1 or Der p 23 at age 5 years or less predicted asthma at school age., CONCLUSIONS: Parental hay fever and early exposure to D pteronyssinus allergens promote IgE polysensitization to several D pteronyssinus molecules, which in turn predicts current mite-related AR and current/future asthma. These results might inspire predictive algorithms and prevention strategies against the progression of IgE sensitization to mites toward AR and asthma.

N2  - Obesity represents one of the major public health problems worldwide, with an increased prevalence also among women of reproductive age. Maternal pre-pregnancy overweight and obesity are important risk factors for a number of maternal and foetal/neonatal complications. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the most recent evidence regarding the associations between pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity and wheezing and asthma in childhood. Potential mechanisms, mediators and confounding factors involved in these associations are also discussed. Despite the relatively large body of studies examining these associations and taking into account main confounders and potential mediators, the causal relationship between maternal obesity and wheezing and asthma in childhood is still uncertain. This uncertainty is not trivial, as any prevention strategy aimed at reducing the burden of these conditions would necessarily imply better understanding of the factors that are in the causal chain.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The majority of pediatric asthma is atopic, but whether pediatric obese asthma is atopic is indeterminate in the literature. In Nevada, children become sensitized to aeroallergens, a risk factor for asthma, at young ages. Additionally, Nevada children have high rates of obesity. Our objective is to determine whether elevated body mass index (BMI) is associated with asthma severity, allergen sensitization, and polysensitization., METHODS: Medical records from a pediatric allergy clinic provided BMI percentile, physician-diagnosed asthma severity, skin prick test data, and sociodemographics such as age, race, sex, and insurance status from asthmatic patients. Descriptive statistics and binary and multinomial logistic regression were conducted., RESULTS: In this population (N = 125) aged 1-16, 61% were male, 65% were white, and 74% had private health insurance. Sixty-five percent of children were under/healthy weight and 29% were overweight/obese. Asthma symptoms were moderate in 66% of the population, and severe in 18%. Nearly 85% of this population was atopic, and 82% were polysensitized. Sensitization and polysensitization occurred in all weight categories. Asthma severity and elevated BMI were not associated significantly. Overweight/obese children (>=85th percentile) had lower odds of allergen sensitization (adjusted odds ratio 0.26, 95% CI = 0.85-0.78, p = 0.016) and polysensitization (adjusted odds ratio 0.30, 95% CI = 0.11-0.85, p = 0.023) than healthy weight children (<85th percentile)., CONCLUSION: Although overweight children did show allergen sensitization, those who were overweight had lower odds of allergen sensitization and lower odds of polysensitization, as compared to normal weight asthmatic children. Elevated BMI was not a significant predictor of asthma severity.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To verify whether the occurrence of acute viral bronchiolitis in the first year of life constitutes a risk factor for asthma at age 6 considering a parental history of asthma., METHODS: Cross-sectional study in a cohort of live births. A standardized questionnaire of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood was applied to the mothers to identify asthma in children at the age of 6 years. Acute viral bronchiolitis diagnosis was performed by maternal report of a medical diagnosis and/or presence of symptoms of coryza accompanied by cough, tachypnea, and dyspnea when participants were 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Socioeconomic, environmental data, parental history of asthma, and data related to pregnancy were collected in the first 72h of life of the newborn and in prospective home visits by trained interviewers. The association between acute viral bronchiolitis and asthma was evaluated by logistic regression analysis and potential modifier effect of parental history was verified by introducing an interaction term into the adjusted logistic regression model., RESULTS: Prevalence of acute viral bronchiolitis in the first year of life was 68.6% (461). The occurrence of acute viral bronchiolitis was a risk factor for asthma at 6 years of age in children with parental history of asthma OR: 2.66, 95% CI (1.10-6.40), modifier effect p=0.002. Parental history of asthma OR: 2.07, 95% CI (1.29-3.30) and male gender OR: 1.69, 95% CI, (1.06-2.69) were other identified risk factors for asthma., CONCLUSION: Acute viral bronchiolitis in the first year of life is a risk factor for asthma in children with parental history of asthma.

N2  - RATIONALE: Preeclampsia reflects an unusual increase in systemic inflammation during pregnancy., OBJECTIVES: We studied associations between preeclampsia and asthma, allergy, and eczema in Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood2000 (COPSAC2000) and in national registries., METHODS: COPSAC2000 is a high-risk birth cohort of 411 Danish children. Asthma, allergy, and eczema were diagnosed prospectively, and lung function measured at age 1 month and 7 years. Sensitization was evaluated at age 6 months, 18 months, 4 years, and 6 years by skin prick tests and IgE measurements. The register-based cohort included 1.7 million children from Danish national registries in the 35-year period 1977-2012. Children born to mothers with preeclampsia were analyzed regarding risk of asthma, allergy, and eczema., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the COPSAC2000 cohort, 5.6% (n = 23) were diagnosed with preeclampsia. Preeclampsia was associated with increased risk of treatment with inhaled corticosteroids at age 7 years (adjusted odds ratio, 4.01 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.11-14.43]; P = 0.0337), increased bronchial responsiveness to methacholine (adjusted beta-coefficient log-mumol, -0.80 [95% CI, -1.55 to -0.06]; P = 0.0348), and allergic rhinitis (adjusted odds ratio, 4.83 [95% CI, 1.58-14.78]; P = 0.0057) in the 7-year-old children. Furthermore, the children had an increased risk of sensitization to both aeroallergens and food allergens, and increased amount of total IgE during childhood. In the registry-based cohort, 3.7% (n = 62,728) were born to mothers with preeclampsia. Preeclampsia was associated with increased risk of asthma, eczema, and aeroallergen and food allergy, especially pronounced after a duration of preeclampsia of 14 days or more. Maternal asthma increased the risk of preeclampsia., CONCLUSIONS: Preeclampsia is a shared prenatal risk factor for asthma, eczema, and allergy in childhood pointing toward in utero immune programming of the child.

N2  - RATIONALE: The heterogeneity of asthma phenotypes may explain inconsistencies in observed associations with environmental exposures., OBJECTIVES: To identify trajectories of childhood asthma and to characterize the potential impact of residential greenness and air pollution on asthma trajectory subgroups., METHODS: Linked administrative databases of medical visits were used to define the occurrence and recurrence of asthma over a 10-year follow-up period within a population-based birth cohort of more than 65,000 children. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify unique asthma trajectories. Weighted multinomial regression was used to assess the relationship between asthma trajectories and risk factors, including environmental exposures., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Group-based trajectory modeling distinguished four trajectories: one with no asthma representing 88.8% of the cohort, one with transient asthma (5.6% of the cohort), and two trajectories with chronic asthma with early (<1 yr; 1.5%) and late (<3 yr; 4.1%) onset during early childhood. These trajectories differed with respect to socioeconomic markers and modifiable risk factors, including maternal smoking and breastfeeding initiation. After accounting for sex, parity, breastfeeding, term birth weight, household income, maternal education, delivery mode, and smoking, an interquartile increase in nitrogen dioxide exposure increased the risk of membership in the early and late-onset chronic asthma trajectories, relative to subjects without asthma, by 50% and 20%, respectively (weighted risk ratio, 1.5 and 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-1.9 and 1.0-1.4). Greenness was not associated with any of the asthma trajectories., CONCLUSIONS: Traffic-related air pollution increased the probability of a chronic asthma trajectory.

T1  - The infant gut bacterial microbiota and risk of pediatric asthma and allergic diseases.
A1  - Johnson, Christine C

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Among the many areas being revolutionized by the recent introduction of culture-independent microbial identification techniques is investigation of the relationship between close contact with large animals, antibiotics, breast feeding, mode of birth, and other exposures during infancy as related to a reduced risk of asthma and allergic disease. These exposures were originally clustered under the "Hygiene Hypothesis" which has evolved into the "Microbiota Hypothesis". This review begins by summarizing epidemiologic studies suggesting that the common feature of these allergy risk-related exposures is their influence on the founding and early development of a child's gut microbiota. Next, studies using culture-independent techniques are presented showing that children who have experienced the exposures of interest have altered gut microbiota. Finally, selected mouse and human studies are presented which begin to corroborate the protective exposures identified in epidemiologic studies by elucidating mechanisms through which microbes can alter immune development and function. These microbially driven immune alterations demonstrate that microbial exposures in many cases could alter the risk of subsequent allergic disease and asthma. Hopefully, a better understanding of how microbes influence allergic disease will lead to safe and effective methods for reducing the prevalence of all forms of allergic disease.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Newborns exhibit the lowest immediate respiratory morbidity rates when born following 39 completed weeks of gestation. We sought to determine whether early-term delivery (37-38 + 6 weeks' gestation) impacts on long-term pediatric respiratory morbidity., STUDY DESIGN: In this population-based prospective cohort analysis, all term singleton deliveries occurring between 1991 and 2013 at a single tertiary medical center were included. Gestational age upon delivery was sub-divided into: early (37-38 + 6 weeks' gestation), full (39-40 + 6 weeks' gestation), late (41-41 + 6 weeks' gestation), and post-term (>42 weeks) deliveries. The incidence of long-term hospitalizations (up to the age of 18 years) of the offspring due to a set of predefined respiratory morbidities was evaluated. Survival curves were used to compare cumulative morbidity incidence. A Cox hazards regression model was used to control for confounders., RESULTS: During the study period, 229,142 term deliveries met the inclusion criteria. Of those, 24% (n = 55,202) occurred at early term. Hospitalizations up to the age of 18 years, as a result of complications in the respiratory system were significantly more common in the early-term group as compared with full and late-term delivery groups. In the Cox regression model, while controlling for multiple confounders, early-term delivery exhibited an independent association with long-term respiratory morbidity (adjusted HR = 1.24, CI 1.19-1.29, P < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: Deliveries occurring at early term are associated with higher rates of pediatric respiratory hospitalizations compared with full and late-term deliveries.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The relation between traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) exposure and the incidence of asthma/allergy in preschool children has been widely studied, but results remain heterogeneous, possibly due to differences in methodology and susceptibility to TRAP., OBJECTIVES: We aimed to study the relation of early TRAP exposure with the development of respiratory/allergic symptoms and asthma during preschool years, and to investigate parental allergy, "stressful" family events, and sex as possible effect modifiers., METHODS: We examined data of 2,015 children from the PARIS birth cohort followed up with repeated questionnaires completed by parents until age 4 years. TRAP exposure in each child's first year of life was estimated by nitrogen oxides (NOx) air dispersion modeling, taking into account both home and day care locations. Association between TRAP exposure and patterns of wheezing, dry night cough, and rhinitis symptoms was studied using multinomial logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders. Effect modification by parental history of allergy, stressful family events, and sex was investigated., RESULTS: An interquartile range (26 mug/m3) increase in NOx levels was associated with an increased odds ratio (OR) of persistent wheezing at 4 years (adjusted OR = 1.27; 95% confidence interval: 1.09, 1.47). TRAP exposure was positively associated with persistent wheeze, dry cough, and rhinitis symptoms among children with a parental allergy, those experiencing stressful family events, and boys, but not in children whose parents did not have allergies or experience stressful events, or in girls (all interaction p-values < 0.2)., CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the hypothesis that not all preschool children are equal regarding TRAP health effects. Parental history of allergy, stressful family events, and male sex may increase their susceptibility to adverse respiratory effects of early TRAP exposure.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract infection is implicated in asthma development. RSV immunoprophylaxis during infancy is efficacious in preventing RSV-related hospitalizations and has been associated with decreased wheezing in the first years of life., OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether greater adherence to immunoprophylaxis in infants at high risk for severe RSV would be associated with decreased childhood asthma., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort investigation including children born from 1996-2003 who were enrolled in Kaiser Permanente Northern California or Tennessee Medicaid and eligible to receive RSV immunoprophylaxis. Asthma was defined at 4.5 to 6 years of age by using asthma-specific health care visits and medication fills. We classified children into immunoprophylaxis eligibility groups and calculated adherence (percentage receipt of recommended doses). We used a set of statistical strategies (multivariable logistic regression and propensity score [PS]-adjusted and PS-matched analyses) to overcome confounding by medical complexity because infants with higher adherence (>=70%) have higher prevalence of chronic lung disease, lower birth weight, and longer nursery stays., RESULTS: By using multivariable logistic regression and PS-adjusted models in the combined group, higher adherence to RSV immunoprophylaxis was not associated with decreased asthma. However, in PS-matched analysis, treated children with 70% or greater adherence had decreased odds of asthma compared with those with 20% or less adherence (odds ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.50-0.78)., CONCLUSIONS: This investigation of RSV immunoprophylaxis in high-risk children primarily found nonsignificant associations on prevention of asthma in specific preterm groups. Our findings highlight the need for larger studies and prospective cohorts and provide estimates of potential preventive effect sizes in high-risk children.

N2  - Objective: The aim of the study was to investigate oral health in asthmatic children using inhaled therapy and to compare the oral health status according to beta2 agonist and corticosteroid dose administrated., Methods: The study group composed of 160 children aged between 2 and 15 years old who had bronchial asthma at different degrees of severity, the children followed at university hospital of Casablanca. A questionnaire was filled referring to oral health habits. For dental examinations, world health organization criteria and for plaque indices the Silness and Loe plaque index were used. Oral mucosal was examined to detect candidiasis or ulcerations., Results: The dental plaque registered was 1,13 +/- 0,64. The mean DMFT was 3,75 +/- 1,53 and the mean DMFT was 5,50 +/- 3,02. A statistically significant higher average DMFT and DMFT values were observed with higher dose of beta2 agonist (p < 0,05). Almost a third of studied population had oral candidiasis and 6,9% had ulcerations. These oral mucosal lesions were particularly observed in children receiving inhaled corticosteroid higher than 400 micro g/j (P < 10-5) and they were lower in children using a spacer device and rinsing the mouth after treatment (P < 10-5)., Conclusion: The results suggest higher caries susceptibility and oral mucosal lesions among asthmatic children undergoing inhaled treatment with beta2 agonist and corticosteroid. A special attention by doctors and health professionals of these patients is necessary and asthmatic children are recommended to adopt more precautionary oral hygiene practices.

N2  - Objective: To estimate the prevalence of eczema in early childhood and effect of infant feeding practice on eczema by different regions of China with diverse climate and dietary patterns. Method: A questionnaire survey was conducted from June 2012 to October 2012 in Shanghai, Hohhot, and Fuzhou. The parent or guardian of the children aged between 2.5 to 3.5 years attending routine health visit in the chosen communities were invited to complete a modified questionnaire of the International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood (ISAAC). Logistic regression model was used to analyze of the family history of allergy, duration of breastfeeding, timing of introduction of complementary foods and other potential confounders. Result: A total of 2 242 children were interviewed, 750 from Shanghai, 716 from Hohhot, and 776 from Fuzhou. The prevalence of eczema in early childhood was significantly different among Shanghai (16.9%, 95%CI 16.87-16.93), Hohhot (34.5%, 95%CI 34.46-34.54)and Fuzhou (44.3%, 95%CI 44.26-44.34). The difference was statistically significant between 3 groups (chi2=72.05, P<0.05). Introducing complementary food after the age of 6 months was associated with a decreased risk for eczema when compared to introduction between 4 to 6 months(odds ratio (OR) 0.58, 95%CI 0.41-0.81) in Fuzhou, while there was no significant association between timing of introduction of complementary foods and eczema in Shanghai and Hohhot. Conclusion: The prevalence of eczema during early childhood is various among three cities. The relationship between timing of introduction of complementary foods and eczema in Fuzhou is different from that in Shanghai and Hohhot. The role of climate and dietary patterns on prevalence of eczema needs further studies.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Risk factors for persistence of food-related symptoms (FRS) and food allergy (FA) from early life to adolescence are incompletely understood. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for FRS and FA in adolescence amongst children with FRS or FA in the first four years of life (early life)., METHODS: In children enrolled in a Swedish birth cohort and followed to 16 years (n = 2572), we defined children with early life FRS in the absence of FA, and FA. Corresponding phenotypes were defined at 16 years. Associations between potential risk factors at 4 years and FRS and FA at 16 years were investigated using logistic regression., RESULTS: Early life FRS and FA prevalences were 12.2% and 6.8%, respectively. Amongst children with early life FRS, 35.7% had FRS or FA at 16 years, whereas 74.3% of the children with early life FA had FA at 16 years. For each of the early life phenotypes, parental allergy, early life allergic multimorbidity, early life reactions to peanuts/tree nuts and IgE reactivity at 4 years were statistically significantly associated with FRS or FA at 16 years. In contrast, male sex was associated with an increased risk of FA at 16 years among children with early life FA only., CONCLUSIONS: In early life, food-related symptoms are twice as common as food allergy. Unlike food allergy, food-related symptoms often remit by adolescence. Yet, these phenotypes have many common risk factors for persistence to adolescence.

N1  - Comment in (CIN)
N2  - Studies of pre-eclampsia and childhood asthma are conflicting, and none have performed a formal mediation analysis of preterm birth.We examined the association between pre-eclampsia and asthma at 7 years using national registries, including all births in Norway from 1999 to 2006 (n=406 907), and a subsample of children in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) (n=45 028) using log-linear regression. We performed a mediation analysis of preterm birth, and a sibling comparison to evaluate unobserved confounding.There was a positive association between pre-eclampsia and asthma in the registry study, with an adjusted relative risk of 1.31 (95% CI 1.22-1.41), but not in MoBa, which had an adjusted relative risk of 1.19 (95% CI 0.99-1.44). The odds ratios for the direct effect not mediated through preterm birth and the indirect effect in the registry linkage were 1.19 (95% CI 1.10-1.29) and 1.12 (95% CI 1.11-1.14), respectively. The sibling comparison indicated no association between pre-eclampsia and asthma (adjusted OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87-1.33).In this large study, which used different datasets and analytic approaches, there was little evidence for an association between pre-eclampsia and childhood asthma. The association was weak and largely explained by pre-term birth and confounders shared by siblings. Copyright ©ERS 2016.

N2  - Patients allergic to aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) who develop respiratory reactions such as bronchospasm or asthma exacerbation have aspirin-induced asthma or NSAIDs-exacerbated respiratory disease. However, large-scale studies have not been conducted to investigate the risk of aspirin/NSAIDs exposure in children with asthma. Therefore, this study evaluated the relationship between aspirin/NSAIDs and the risk of asthma exacerbation in children with asthma.This retrospective cohort study was conducted using the data of 1 million random beneficiaries of the Taiwan National Health Insurance program between 1997 and 2012. Children aged 18 years diagnosed with asthma by physicians were enrolled. The study population was divided into the index group (concurrently using antiasthmatic agents and NSAIDs patients) and reference group (using antiasthmatic drugs alone), and the relative risks (RRs) of hospitalizations resulting from asthma exacerbation in both groups were estimated.The rate of asthma exacerbation was higher in the index group than the reference group, resulting in asthma-related hospitalizations (RR: 1.49, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.37-1.61; adjusted RR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.30-1.53). Short-term aspirin, ibuprofen, and diclofenac use probably correlated with asthma exacerbation in children with asthma. No association between long-term aspirin, ibuprofen, and diclofenac consumption and the risk of asthma exacerbation was identified in this study.

N2  - Background. Prevalence of childhood asthma varies significantly among regions, while its reasons are not clear yet with only a few studies reporting relevant causes for this variation. Objective . To investigate the potential role of city-average levels of air pollutants and climatic factors in order to distinguish differences in asthma prevalence in China and explain their reasons. Methods . Data pertaining to 10,777 asthmatic patients were obtained from the third nationwide survey of childhood asthma in China's urban areas. Annual mean concentrations of air pollutants and other climatic factors were obtained for the same period from several government departments. Data analysis was implemented with descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation coefficient, and multiple regression analysis. Results . Pearson correlation analysis showed that the situation of childhood asthma was strongly linked with SO2, relative humidity, and hours of sunshine (p < 0.05). Multiple regression analysis indicated that, among the predictor variables in the final step, SO2 was found to be the most powerful predictor variable amongst all (beta = -19.572, p < 0.05). Furthermore, results had shown that hours of sunshine (beta = -0.014, p < 0.05) was a significant component summary predictor variable. Conclusion . The findings of this study do not suggest that air pollutants or climate, at least in terms of children, plays a major role in explaining regional differences in asthma prevalence in China.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The rates of childhood allergic conditions are changing, prompting the need for continued surveillance. Examination of healthcare provider-based diagnosis data is an important and lacking methodology needed to complement existing studies that rely on participant reporting., METHODS: Utilizing our care network of 1,050,061 urban and sub-urban children, we defined two retrospective cohorts: (1) a closed birth cohort of 29,662 children and (2) a cross-sectional cohort of 333,200 children. These cohorts were utilized to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of the conditions studied. Logistic regression was utilized to determine the extent to which food allergy was associated with respiratory allergy., RESULTS: In our birth cohort, the peak age at diagnosis of eczema, asthma, rhinitis, and food allergy was between 0 and 5 months (7.3 %), 12 and 17 months (8.7 %), 24 and 29 months (2.5 %), and 12 and 17 months (1.9 %), respectively. In our cross-sectional cohort, eczema and rhinitis prevalence rates were 6.7 % and 19.9 %, respectively. Asthma prevalence was 21.8 %, a rate higher than previously reported. Food allergy prevalence was 6.7 %, with the most common allergenic foods being peanut (2.6 %), milk (2.2 %), egg (1.8 %), shellfish (1.5 %), and soy (0.7 %). Food allergy was associated with development of asthma (OR 2.16, 95 % CI 1.94-2.40), and rhinitis (OR 2.72, 95 % CI 2.45-3.03)., CONCLUSIONS: Compared with previous reports, we measure lower rates of eczema and higher rates of asthma. The distribution of the major allergenic foods diverged from prior figures, and food allergy was associated with the development of respiratory allergy. The utilization of provider-based diagnosis data contributes an important and lacking methodology that complements existing studies.

N2  - UNLABELLED: Objective of research was to study features of ontogenesis and feeding in the first months of life in children with laryngotracheitis (LT), recurrent laryngotracheitis (RLT) and asthma., METHODS: Questionnaire-based survey was performed to collect data on anamnesis of 1004 children aged 6-14 years (575 children with a history of LT, 60 children with asthma, and 369 children of control group) pertaining to preeclampsia in mothers, history of birth asphyxia, preterm birth and feeding during the first months of life in children. Children with LT were divided into two groups: 458 children with 1-3 episodes of LT and 117 children with RLT (4 or more episodes of LT)., RESULTS: The frequency of preeclampsia among mothers of children with RLT exceeded the corresponding frequency among mothers of children with 1-3 episodes of LT and children of control group in 2.1 and 2.8 times, respectively. The frequency of birth asphyxia or preterm birth among children with RLT exceeded the corresponding frequency among children with 1-3 episodes of LT and children of control group by a factor of 2. The frequency of breastfeeding initiation after 24 hours of birth among children with asthma or RLT exceeded the corresponding frequency among children with 1-3 episodes of LT (in 1.4 and 1.5 times, respectively) and among children of control group (in 2.4 and 2.6 times, respectively)., CONCLUSION: The frequency of preeclampsia in mothers, birth asphyxia, preterm birth and late initiation of breastfeeding among children with RLT exceeded the corresponding frequency among children with 1-3 episodes of LT and children of control group. There was no significant difference between the frequency of preeclampsia in mothers, birth asphyxia, initiation of breastfeeding among children with RLT and children with asthma. Formula feeding in the first months of life was equally often observed among children with LT, RLT and asthma and significantly exceeded the corresponding percentage among children in control group.

T1  - An imperfect "PAST" Lessons learned from the National Review of Asthma Deaths (NRAD) UK.
A1  - Nasser, Shuaib
Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Asthma deaths are a barometer of the quality of asthma care. The principal care for patients with severe asthma is often a joint partnership between primary and secondary services. Communication between the two services determines the effectiveness of treatment. Undertaking an audit on asthma in either primary or separately in secondary care is a relatively straightforward process. However, when the audit spans both primary and secondary care in a country as large as the United Kingdom which is further sub-divided into the separate healthcare systems of England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Island, then the audit becomes considerably more challenging. The National Review of Asthma Deaths (NRAD) reported in May 2014 was a confidential enquiry tasked with identifying circumstances surrounding asthma deaths across the whole of the UK, in order to ascertain avoidable factors and make recommendations to improve care and reduce future asthma deaths (Why asthma still kills: the National Review of Asthma Deaths (NRAD) Confidential Enquiry report, 2014, http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/sites/default/files/why-asthma-still-kills-full-report.pdf ). The idea for NRAD arose from a longstanding East of England confidential enquiry started in 1988 by Dr Brian Harrison and then handed onto me in 2001 until funding for the national review of asthma deaths was secured in 2010.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Asthma is the leading chronic condition among children. Given this international burden, clinicians and public health professionals applied the Expanded Chronic Care Model to address health adversities of pediatric patients with asthma., OBJECTIVE: This study examined the influence of a clinical health promotion initiative on asthma control and appropriate medication management among pediatric patients., METHODS: Patients (n = 304) were recruited and screened for participation in this study. All the patients participated in a motivational interview, received clinical care, and were monitored longitudinally. Eligible patients (n = 53) were referred to one or more intervention pathways regarding physical activity, nutrition, smoking cessation, and psychosocial wellness. A comparison group (n = 90) was eligible for an intervention but chose not to participate. This analysis focused on patients who were identified as needing a health intervention beyond asthma clinical care., RESULTS: Among patients who were invited to participate in the health promotion pathways, significant decreases in asthma exacerbation were achieved by the patients who participated in the intervention compared with those who did not participate (p = 0.018). Significant improvements in asthma exacerbation, activity limitations, and asthma control were attributed to the time in clinical care (p < 0.001). In this group, asthma control significantly improved with medication (p = 0.002), and age was associated with a significant decrease in asthma exacerbation (p = 0.011)., CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrated preliminary benefits in a child asthma population. In addition, this experience addressed the chronicity of pediatric asthma through patient-centered care.

N2  - RATIONALE: Little is known about the long-term effects of air pollution exposure and the root causes of asthma. We use exposure to intense air pollution from the 1952 Great Smog of London as a natural experiment to examine both issues., OBJECTIVES: To determine whether exposure to extreme air pollution in utero or soon after birth affects asthma development later in life., METHODS: This was a natural experiment using the unanticipated pollution event by comparing the prevalence of asthma between those exposed to the Great Smog in utero or the first year of life with those conceived well before or after the incident and those residing outside the affected area at the time of the smog., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Prevalence of asthma during childhood (ages 0-15) and adulthood (ages >15) is analyzed for 2,916 respondents to the Life History portion of the English Longitudinal Study on Aging born from 1945 to 1955. Exposure to the Great Smog in the first year of life increases the likelihood of childhood asthma by 19.87 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.37-36.38). We also find suggestive evidence that early-life exposure led to a 9.53 percentage point increase (95% CI, -4.85 to 23.91) in the likelihood of adult asthma and exposure in utero led to a 7.91 percentage point increase (95% CI, -2.39 to 18.20) in the likelihood of childhood asthma., CONCLUSIONS: These results are the first to link early-life pollution exposure to later development of asthma using a natural experiment, suggesting the legacy of the Great Smog is ongoing.

T1  - The intersection between asthma and acute chest syndrome in children with sickle-cell anaemia.
A1  - DeBaun, Michael R

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Acute chest syndrome is a frequent cause of acute lung disease in children with sickle-cell disease. Asthma is common in children with sickle-cell disease and is associated with increased incidence of vaso-occlusive pain events, acute chest syndrome episodes, and earlier death. Risk factors for asthma exacerbation and an acute chest syndrome episode are similar, and both can present with shortness of breath, chest pain, cough, and wheezing. Despite overlapping risk factors and symptoms, an acute exacerbation of asthma or an episode of acute chest syndrome are two distinct entities that need disease-specific management strategies. Although understanding has increased about asthma as a comorbidity in sickle-cell disease and its effects on morbidity, substantial gaps remain in knowledge about best management.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have found associations between meteorological variables and asthma hospitalisations but the nature of these associations has varied and few studies have been done in subtropical areas or evaluated effect modification by age., OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate associations between asthma hospitalisations and meteorological factors and to assess effect modification of these associations by age and season in Hong Kong., METHODS: Poisson generalised additive models combined with distributed lag nonlinear models and piecewise linear models were used to model associations between daily asthma hospitalisations from 2004 to 2011 and meteorological factors and air pollutants, adjusting for day of week, seasonality and trend. Subgroup analyses by age and season were performed., RESULTS: In the hot season, hospitalisations were lowest at 27degreeC, rose to a peak at 30degreeC, then plateaued between 30degreeC and 32degreeC. The cumulative relative risk for lags 0-3 days (RRlag0-3) for 30degreeC vs 27degreeC was 1.19 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.34). In the cold season, temperature was negatively associated with asthma hospitalisations. The cumulative RRlag0-3 for 12degreeC vs 25degreeC was 1.33 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.58). Adult admissions were most sensitive to temperatures in both seasons while admissions among children under 5 were least associated. Higher humidity and ozone levels in the hot season, and low humidity in the cold season were also associated with more asthma admissions., CONCLUSIONS: People with asthma should avoid exposure to adverse conditions by limiting outdoor activities during periods of extreme temperatures, combinations of high humidity and high temperature, and low humidity and low temperature, and high ozone levels.

N2  - IMPORTANCE: Childhood asthma is characterized by disparities in the experience of morbidity, including the risk for readmission to the hospital after an initial hospitalization. African American children have been shown to have more than 2 times the hazard of readmission when compared with their white counterparts., OBJECTIVE: To explain why African American children are at greater risk for asthma-related readmissions than white children., DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study was completed as part of the Greater Cincinnati Asthma Risks Study, a population-based, prospective, observational cohort. From August 2010 to October 2011, it enrolled 695 children, aged 1 to 16 years, admitted for asthma or wheezing who identified as African American (n = 441) or white (n = 254) in an inpatient setting of an urban, tertiary care children's hospital., MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was time to asthma-related readmission and race was the predictor. Biologic, environmental, disease management, access, and socioeconomic hardship variables were measured; their roles in understanding racial readmission disparities were conceptualized using a directed acyclic graphic. Inverse probability of treatment weighting balanced African American and white children with respect to key measured variables. Racial differences in readmission hazard were assessed using weighted Cox proportional hazards regression and Kaplan-Meier curves., RESULTS: The sample was 65% male (n = 450), and the median age was 5.4 years. African American children were 2.26 times more likely to be readmitted than white children (95% CI, 1.56-3.26). African American children significantly differed with respect to nearly every measured biologic, environmental, disease management, access, and socioeconomic hardship variable. Socioeconomic hardship variables explained 53% of the observed disparity (hazard ratio, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.05-2.05). The addition of biologic, environmental, disease management, and access variables resulted in 80% of the readmission disparity being explained. The difference between African American and white children with respect to readmission hazard no longer reached the level of significance (hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.87-1.60; Cox P = .30 and log-rank P = .39)., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A total of 80% of the observed readmission disparity between African American and white children could be explained after statistically balancing available biologic, environmental, disease management, access to care, and socioeconomic and hardship variables across racial groups. Such a comprehensive, well-framed approach to exposures that are associated with morbidity is critical as we attempt to better understand and lessen persistent child asthma disparities.

N2  - BACKGROUND: We recently reported a more rapid waning of vaccine-induced humoral immunity (measles vaccine) in children with asthma. It is unknown if asthma affects susceptibility to vaccine-preventable diseases., OBJECTIVE: To determine whether asthma is associated with an increased risk of vaccine-preventable disease, e.g., breakthrough varicella infection., METHODS: This was a retrospective population-based case-control study that examined cases of breakthrough varicella among children between 2005 and 2011. Children with a diagnosis of breakthrough varicella infection in Olmsted County, Minnesota (infection of >42 days after vaccination) between 2005 and 2011 and two age- and sex-matched controls were enrolled for each case. Asthma status was determined by using predetermined criteria. Conditional logistic regression models were used to calculate matched odds ratios (OR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI)., RESULTS: Of the 165 cases and their 330 matched controls, 48% were boys and the mean (standard deviation) age at the index date was 6.6 +/- 3.5 years for both cases and controls. Of the 330 controls, 80 (24%) had two doses of the varicella vaccine compared with only 23 (14%) of the 165 cases (OR 0.29 [95% CI, 0.14-0.61]; p = 0.001). Children with a history of asthma ever had a higher risk of developing breakthrough varicella compared with those without a history of asthma (adjusted OR 1.63 [95% CI, 1.04-2.55]; p = 0.032) when adjusting for elapsed time since the first varicella vaccination and the number of varicella vaccine doses., CONCLUSIONS: A history of asthma might be an unrecognized risk factor for breakthrough varicella infection. Children with asthma should follow the two-dose varicella vaccine policy.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The presence of certain underlying medical conditions is known to increase the risk of pneumococcal disease in persons of all ages and across a wide spectrum of conditions, as demonstrated in two recent evaluations. Corresponding estimates of attributable economic costs have not been well characterized. We thus undertook a retrospective evaluation to estimate rates and costs of pneumococcal disease among children and adults with and without underlying medical conditions in the United States., METHODS: Data were obtained from three independent healthcare claims repositories. The study population included all persons enrolled in participating health plans during 2007-2010, and was stratified into subgroups based on age and risk profile: healthy; at-risk, due to selected comorbid conditions; and high-risk, due to selected immunocompromising conditions. At-risk and high-risk conditions, as well as episodes of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and all-cause pneumonia (PNE), were identified via diagnosis, procedure, and drug codes. Rates and healthcare costs of IPD and PNE (2010US$) among at-risk and high-risk persons were compared with those from age-stratified healthy counterparts using incidence rate ratios (IRR) and cost ratios., RESULTS: Rates of IPD and PNE were consistently higher among at-risk persons (IRR = 4.1 [95 % CI 3.9-4.3] and 4.5 [4.49-4.53]) and high-risk persons (IRR = 10.3 [9.7-11.0] and 8.2 [8.2-8.3]) of all ages versus their healthy counterparts. Rates were notably high for at-risk persons with >=2 conditions (IRR = 9.0 [8.4-9.7] and 10.3 [10.3-10.4]), as well as those with asthma (IRR = 3.4 [3.0-3.8] and 4.5 [4.47-4.53]) or diabetes (IRR = 4.3 [4.0-4.6] and 4.7 [4.6-4.7]). Healthcare costs totaled $21.7 million per 100,000 at-risk person-years and $58.5 million per 100,000 high-risk person-years, which were 8.7 [8.5-8.8] and 23.4 [22.9-23.8] times higher than corresponding costs for healthy persons., CONCLUSIONS: Rates and costs of IPD and PNE are substantially higher among persons with certain chronic and immunocompromising conditions versus those without any such conditions. Rates and costs for persons with asthma and diabetes were especially increased, and rates and costs for individuals with >=2 at-risk conditions approached those among persons with high-risk conditions.

N2  - RATIONALE: Risk factors for severe asthma exacerbations in children requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) may occur in variety of medical, environmental, economic, and socioeconomic domains., OBJECTIVES: We sought to characterize medical and sociodemographic risk factors among children who required admission to the intensive care unit for asthma., METHODS: Data were obtained from the Greater Cincinnati Asthma Risk Study, a population-based, prospective, observational cohort of children admitted for treatment of acute asthma or bronchodilator-responsive wheezing. Data collected on 774 children included race, socioeconomic status, allergen sensitization, environmental exposures, psychosocial strain, and financial hardship. Analyses compared children admitted to the ICU to those admitted to a medical inpatient unit., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One hundred sixty-one (20.9%) children required admission to intensive care. There was no difference in sex, race, insurance status, caregiver educational level, income, financial strain, psychological distress, or marital status between the ICU and non-ICU cohorts. Risk for medication nonadherence assessed by parent report was not different between groups. Although previous hospital admission or emergency department visit history did not differ between the groups, prior ICU admission was more common among those admitted to the ICU at the index admission (27 vs. 16%, P = 0.002). Children requiring intensive care admission were more likely to be sensitized to multiple aeroallergens. Exposure to cigarette smoke (measured as salivary cotinine), although a risk factor for hospital admission, was negatively associated with risk of ICU admission., CONCLUSIONS: Social and economic risk factors typically predictive of increased asthma morbidity, including exposure to tobacco smoke, were not associated with ICU admission among a population of children admitted to the hospital for treatment of acute asthma. Intrinsic disease factors, including allergic sensitization, may be more important predictors of ICU admission.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to investigate the association between anti-Toxocara IgG seropositivity and asthma in children., METHODS: This was a case-control study conducted in a university hospital in south Brazil between May 2012 and June 2013. Were recruited 208 children up to 12 years old of whom 156 had asthma (cases) and 52 did not have asthma (controls), with a case-control ratio of 3:1 matched by age. Children's parents or guardians were interviewed using a structured questionnaire with closed questions. Serology was performed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with excretory-secretory antigen of Toxocara canis (TES)., RESULTS: The seroprevalence of IgG anti-T. canis antibodies was 12.8% in the cases and 7.7% in the controls. There was no significant association between seropositivity to T. canis and risk of asthma (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 1.89, 95% CI: 0.52 to 6.89, p = 0.33). Household income < 2 minimum salaries, paternal school years < 9, allergic rhinitis in children, a positive family history of asthma and rhinitis and contact with cats were significantly associated with asthma, with adjusted ORs (95% CIs) of 3.05 (1.21 to 7.73), 2.83 (1.11 to 7.18), 10.5 (4.32 to 25.6), 2.65 (1.14 to 6.17), 2.49 (1.07 to 5.78) and 2.73 (1.03 to 7.27), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: This study did not find a statistically significant association between seropositivity to Toxocara sp. and risk of asthma in children. Low family income, low paternal education level, concomitant allergic rhinitis, family history of asthma and allergic rhinitis and contact with cats were independent factors associated with childhood asthma.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Childhood asthma is a global problem affecting the respiratory health of children. Physical activity (PA) plays a role in the relationship between asthma and respiratory health. We hypothesized that a low level of PA would be associated with asthma in children and adolescents. The objectives of our study were to (1) summarize the evidence available on associations between PA and asthma prevalence in children and adolescents and (2) assess the role of PA in new-onset or incident asthma among children and adolescents., METHODS: We searched Medline, the Cochrane Library, and Embase and extracted data from original articles that met the inclusion criteria. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) were used to express the results of the meta-analysis (forest plot). We explored heterogeneity using funnel plots and the Graphic Appraisal Tool for Epidemiology (GATE)., RESULTS: We retrieved 1,571 titles and selected 11 articles describing three cohort and eight cross-sectional studies for inclusion. A meta-analysis of the cohort studies revealed a risk of new-onset asthma in children with low PA (OR [95 % CI] 1.32 [0.95; 1.84] [random effects] and 1.35 [1.13; 1.62] [fixed effects]). Three cross-sectional studies identified significant positive associations between childhood asthma or asthma symptoms and low PA., CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents with low PA levels had an increased risk of new-onset asthma, and some had a higher risk of current asthma/or wheezing; however, there was some heterogeneity among the studies. This review reveals a critical need for future longitudinal assessments of low PA, its mechanisms, and its implications for incident asthma in children. The systematic review was prospectively registered at PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42014013761; available at: http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO [accessed: 24 March 2016]).

N2  - Studies suggest that children who start solid foods early are at risk for developing food allergies. Herein, we evaluated the effects of the introduction of peanuts to the diets of children on emerging peanut allergies. Children with allergic rhinitis and asthma were enrolled in the present study and evaluated in four stages. In the first stage, a clinical history was completed for all participants. In the second stage, skin tests were conducted to detect the sensitization to peanuts. In the third stage, the parents were interviewed about the peanut-eating habits of their children. In the fourth stage, children with a convincing history of allergy or a positive peanut skin test result were subjected to an open oral food challenge (OOFC). Three hundred children in four groups were included, 58.2% of the subjects were male, and the mean age was 7.3+/-3.9 years. The median age of first exposure to peanuts in patients with peanut allergies was greater than that in children without peanut allergies (2 years versus 1 year; p=0.009). The multivariate analysis, including only those children subjected to the OOFC, revealed that the consumption of peanuts after the age of >=2 years is a risk factor for developing a peanut allergy (odds ratio=8.0, 95% confidence interval 1.3-50.0, p=0.026). The results of the present study showed that the late introduction of peanuts to children increases the risk of developing a peanut allergy.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the prevalence and determine the risk factors of asthma in First Nations children aged 0 to 11 years living on reserves in Canada., METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we considered the data collected as part of the First Nations Regional Health Survey involving 6,657 children living in 238 First Nations communities in the 10 Canadian provinces, the Northwest Territories and the Yukon., RESULTS: The overall prevalence of asthma that has lasted or is expected to last at least six months (ever-asthma) among children living on reserves was 14.6%: a prevalence of 12.9% among 0 to 4 year olds and 15.6% among 5 to 11 year olds. The prevalence of ever-asthma was greater among boys (16.1%) than girls (13.2%). Children from homes with two or more children aged less than 11 years and those who were engaged in daily physical activities were less likely to have a report of ever-asthma. Children from high-income families and smoke-free homes were more likely to have a report of ever-asthma. The association between allergy and ever-asthma was stronger in children with low birth weight. The association between chronic ear infections and ever-asthma was stronger in girls than boys., CONCLUSIONS: The overall prevalence of ever-asthma and factors associated with ever-asthma in First Nations children living on reserves were similar to those reported for off-reserve Aboriginal children and non-Aboriginal Canadian children.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To present the Programa Infantil de Prevencao de Asma (PIPA, Program for the Prevention of Childhood Asthma) and the characteristics of the patients followed in this program., METHODS: Implemented in the city of Uruguaiana, Brazil, PIPA has as its target population children and adolescents (< 18 years of age) with asthma or suspected asthma. Patients either enroll in PIPA spontaneously or are referred by pediatricians or primary care physicians. In this retrospective study, we use a standardized protocol to assess PIPA patients., RESULTS: By the end of the study period, 646 patients were being followed. Of those, 298 (46.1%) were <= 3 years of age. In this group of patients, recurrent wheezing was identified in 60.7%, and the first episode of wheezing occurred in the first six months of life in 86.0%. Severe wheezing was identified in 29.5% and 45.4% in the children <= 3 and > 3 years of age, respectively. Physician-diagnosed asthma was reported in 26.5% and 82.2%, respectively. In the sample as a whole, the prevalence of passive smoking was high (> 36%), occurring during pregnancy in > 15%; > 40% of the patients had been born by cesarean section; and 30% had a mother who had had < 8 years of schooling., CONCLUSIONS: A prevention program for children with asthma is an effective strategy for controlling the disease. Knowledge of local epidemiological and environmental characteristics is essential to reducing the prevalence of the severe forms of asthma, to improving the use of health resources, and to preventing pulmonary changes that could lead to COPD in adulthood.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Several topics on childhood asthma were addressed in the Paediatric Clinical Year in Review session at the 2015 European Respiratory Society International Congress. With regard to the relationship between lower respiratory tract infections and asthma, it emerges that is the number of respiratory episodes in the first years of life, but not the particular viral trigger, to be associated with later asthma development. Understanding which characteristics of individual patients are associated with an increased risk for asthma exacerbation is a critical step to implement strategies preventing these seasonal events. Recent data suggest the possibility that exhaled volatile organic compounds may qualify as biomarkers in detecting early signs of asthma. Adding information of exhaled volatile organic compounds and expression of inflammation genes to a clinical tool significantly improves asthma prediction in preschool wheezy children. Personal communication with children and adolescents is likely more important than the tools actually used for monitoring asthma. Systemic corticosteroids do not affect the long-term prognosis in children with first viral-induced wheezing episode and should be used cautiously during acute episodes. Finally, stress and a polymorphism upstream of a specific gene are both associated with reduced bronchodilator response in children with asthma. Copyright ©ERS 2016.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Risk factors of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) are incompletely understood. Recently, we reported that among patients with PIBD, a previous diagnosis of cow's milk allergy (CMA) and asthma occurred more frequently than among age- and sex-matched peers. We tested at a national level the hypothesis that CMA is associated with the risk of contracting PIBD., METHODS: A nationwide birth cohort (n = 225,041), including all Finnish children born between 1999 and 2002, was followed up until July 1, 2014. We identified all children with a diagnosis of CMA, asthma, and PIBD from a national register; the data were based on certificates, including diagnostic criteria. The 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the incidence rates per 100,000 person-years were calculated assuming a Poisson distribution., RESULTS: We identified 7,910 infants with CMA yielding a cumulative incidence of 3.5% by 2 years of age. The cumulative incidence of PIBD was 0.14% (n = 316) and that of asthma 6.6% (14,807). Children with CMA were more likely to develop PIBD than non-CMA children, incidence ratio 2.6 (95% CI 1.7-3.8). Children with a diagnosis of CMA contracted PIBD at a younger age than the respective non-CMA group (9 vs. 11 years, p < 0.05). The risk was more evident for ulcerative colitis than for Crohn's disease. The association between CMA and asthma was stronger than that between CMA and PIBD., CONCLUSIONS: CMA in infancy is associated with subsequent development of asthma and PIBD. This suggests that in a subgroup of patients, CMA may share underlying background with PIBD, warranting thorough follow-up. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between allergic manifestations in early life and the occurrence of newly diagnosed autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) throughout childhood., STUDY DESIGN: We collected a population-based longitudinal cohort comprising children enrolled in Taiwan's National Health Insurance Program during 2000-2010. We first identified 387,262 children who had a diagnosis of atopic dermatitis (AD) before age 2 years, with 1:1 individualized matching to children without AD. Cox regression analyses were performed to estimate the early-onset and cumulative effects of allergic manifestations on ASD and ADHD., RESULTS: An estimated 0.5% of AD-exposed children received a diagnosis of ASD, and 3.7% were diagnosed with ADHD, significantly higher than the respective rates of 0.4% and 2.9% found in their nonexposed peers. Having AD before age 2 years was associated with an increased hazard ratio (HR) for ASD by 10% and that for ADHD by 16%; such increases were particularly prominent among those with earlier-onset or more severe AD. HRs were especially higher for children with persistent AD and emerging atopic respiratory diseases in childhood (eg, for ASD, adjusted HR, 1.75 and 2.13, respectively; P < .001)., CONCLUSION: The observed increased risks of ASD and ADHD associated with AD in infancy suggest that a disordered immunologic response may exert effects on neurodevelopment and have implications for research into etiology and treatment strategies.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess our prospective mother-child cohort and the national registry data to analyze the risk of asthma by delivery mode and whether cesarean delivery before or after membrane rupture affects this risk differently., STUDY DESIGN: The Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood2000 is a high-risk birth cohort of 411 Danish children. Asthma was diagnosed prospectively by physicians at the research site, and associations with cesarean delivery were investigated using Cox proportional hazard models. From the Danish national prospective registry we included data from 1997-2010. Childhood asthma was defined from recurrent use of inhaled corticosteroids filled at pharmacies. Cesarean delivery was classified as either before or after rupture of membranes, and the risk of asthma was compared with vaginal delivery. Results were adjusted stepwise for age and calendar year, sex, birth weight, gestational age, multiple births, parity, and maternal factors (age, smoking/antibiotics during pregnancy, employment status, and asthma)., RESULTS: In the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood2000 cohort, the adjusted hazard ratio for asthma was increased by cesarean delivery relative to vaginal birth 2.18 (1.27-3.73). Registry data replicated these findings. Cesarean delivery performed before rupture of membranes carried significantly higher risk of asthma, (incidence rate ratio to vaginal delivery 1.20 [1.16-1.23]) than cesarean delivery after rupture of membranes (incidence rate ratio to vaginal delivery 1.12 [1.09-1.16])., CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed cesarean delivery to be a risk factor for childhood asthma. This effect was more pronounced for cesarean delivery performed before rupture of membranes. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Asthma pathogenesis is a complex interaction of genetic, ethnic, environmental and social/life style risk factors., AIM: The goal of this study was to identify associations, if any, in children with asthma, between environmental risk factors (exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke (STS), pet ownership, race and a family history of asthma., METHODS: After IRB approval, from June 2011 to December 2014, 823 children with asthma were enrolled in this prospective cross sectional study. At the initial visit, families completed a questionnaire with information on family history of asthma, having a pet at home and exposure to STS by parents at home. Chi square analyses were calculated, with alpha level of significance <=0.05., RESULTS: History of asthma in parents, siblings or grandparents was reported by 575 (69.8%) patients including father (n = 154, 17.8%) and mother (n = 235, 26.5%). Children with family history of asthma (n = 575) were significantly more likely to have a pet at home and exposure to STS (n = 347, 60.3% and n = 198, 34.4%, respectively) compared to families without a history of asthma (n = 124, 50%, p = 0.006 and n = 44, 17.7%, p < 0.001, respectively). Similarly, asthmatic children with exposure to STS (n = 241) were significantly more likely to have a pet at home and a family history of asthma (n = 153, 63.5% and n = 197, 81.7%, respectively) compared to children with no STS exposure (n = 315, 55.5%, p = 0.034 and n = 371, 65.3%, p < 0.001 respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Significantly more asthmatic children with immediate relatives with a history of asthma have a pet at home and experience STS exposure compared to children without relatives with a history of asthma, suggesting association between life style choices/environmental exposures and family history of asthma.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis (i.e. severe bronchiolitis) are at increased risk of childhood asthma. There are many known risk factors for severe bronchiolitis, including cardiac and pulmonary diseases. Less is known about the association between atopic diseases and risk of severe bronchiolitis. We sought to further examine risk factors for severe bronchiolitis, focusing on atopic dermatitis (AD)., METHODS: We conducted a nested cohort study within the Massachusetts General Hospital Obstetric Maternal Study (MOMS), a prospective cohort of pregnant women enrolled during 1998-2006. Children of mothers enrolled in MOMS were included in the analysis if they received care within our health system (n = 5407). Potential risk factors for bronchiolitis and hospitalization data were extracted from the children's electronic health records; we also examined pregnancy and perinatal risk factors collected from the underlying MOMS data., RESULTS: During the first year of life, 125 infants (2.3%) had severe bronchiolitis. Eighteen of these patients had AD; 11 (61%) were diagnosed with AD prior to bronchiolitis hospitalization. In unadjusted analyses, AD was associated with severe bronchiolitis (chi(2) 14.6; p < 0.001). In multivariable analyses adjusting for nine known risk factors for severe bronchiolitis, including demographics, birth season, disposition at birth, cardiac disease, maternal parity, and delivery mode, AD was associated with increased odds of severe bronchiolitis (odds ratio 2.72, 95% confidence interval 1.60-4.63)., CONCLUSIONS: Atopic dermatitis is significantly associated with severe bronchiolitis in infancy. The mechanism of the AD-bronchiolitis association is unclear and merits further study; this research may shed light on the pathogenesis of asthma. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

N2  - Asthma is the commonest and most important chronic non-infectious disease in childhood and it has become more prevalent in recent years. There is a shortage of studies in relation to early childhood and so, as part of the INAIRCHILD project, this cross-sectional study aimed to assess the prevalence of asthma and its associated risk factors, namely demographic, environmental, psychosocial and clinical factors for infants and preschoolers living in Northern Portugal. Data concerning asthma prevalence were collected through questionnaires based on those from the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC-derived), the questionnaires were distributed to 1042 children attending the 17 nurseries involved in the INAIRCHILD project (10 in urban and suburban context, and 7 in rural context). The response rate was 48%. Prevalence of asthma based on symptomatology and odds ratio was calculated. Around 52% of the studied children presented at least one of the respiratory symptoms investigated (wheeze, dyspnea and cough) in the absence of upper respiratory infections. The prevalence of asthma was 10.7%, comparable to the figures for Portuguese schoolchildren (6-7 years old) reported by the national Directorate-General of Health, thus showing that an early diagnosis might be possible and helpful for the mitigation of childhood asthma. Environmental context (urban, suburban or rural), gender and family asthma history showed clear associations with asthma prevalence, namely non-rural location, male gender, and having an asthmatic parent were found to be risk factors.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Preterm birth, low birth weight and rapid infant weight gain are associated with increased risks of asthma symptoms in childhood. The underlying mechanism may include persistently higher airway resistance (Rint). The aim of our study was to examine the associations of longitudinally measured foetal and infant growth characteristics with Rint and asthma outcomes in school-age children., METHODS: This study was embedded in a population-based prospective cohort study in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Foetal growth was estimated by ultrasound in the second and third trimesters. Infant growth was measured at birth, 3, 6 and 12 months. At age 6 years, Rint was measured, and information about wheezing and asthma was obtained by questionnaires. The number of subjects per analysis differed per available outcome (3954-5066 subjects)., RESULTS: Longitudinal growth analyses showed that school-age children with increased Rint had lower foetal length growth and weight gain, and lower infant length growth. Children with persistent wheezing until age 6 years and physician-diagnosed asthma had a higher Rint compared with children who never wheezed or without asthma (difference z-scores Rint: 0.58 (0.19, 0.97) and 0.55 (0.15, 0.95), respectively)., CONCLUSION: Rint in school-age children is influenced by foetal growth restriction and is associated with asthma outcomes.

N2  - RATIONALE: Growing up on a farm protects from childhood asthma and early wheeze. Virus-triggered wheeze in infancy predicts asthma in individuals with a genetic asthma risk associated with chromosome 17q21., OBJECTIVES: To test environmental determinants of infections and wheeze in the first year of life, potential modifications of these associations by 17q21, and the implications for different trajectories of wheeze., METHODS: We followed 983 children in rural areas of Europe from birth until age 6 years. Symptoms of wheeze, rhinitis, fever, and environmental exposures were documented with weekly diaries during year 1. Asthma at age 6 was defined as ever having a reported doctor's diagnosis. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms related to ORMDL3 (rs8076131) and GSDMB (rs7216389, rs2290400) at 17q21 were genotyped., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Early wheeze was positively associated with presence of older siblings among carriers of known asthma risk alleles at 17q21 (e.g., rs8076131) (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-2.01). Exposure to farm animal sheds was inversely related to wheeze (aOR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.33-0.60). Both effects were similarly observed in children with transient wheeze up to age 3 years without subsequent development of asthma (aOR, 1.71 [95% CI, 1.09-2.67]; and aOR, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.30-0.76], respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the chromosome 17q21 locus relates to episodes of acute airway obstruction common to both transient wheeze and asthma. The previously identified asthma risk alleles are the ones susceptible to environmental influences. Thus, this gene-environment interaction reveals two faces of 17q21: The same genotype constitutes genetic risk and allows for environmental protection, thereby providing options for prospective prevention strategies.

N2  - PURPOSE: Observationally in Western settings, breastfeeding is associated with less childhood wheezing disorders but may be confounded by socioeconomic position. We examined the association of breastfeeding with asthma and other wheezing disorders in a developed non-Western setting with unique social patterning of breastfeeding., METHODS: Using Cox regression, we examined the adjusted associations of breastfeeding with public hospital admissions for asthma, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Version. Clinical Modification: 466, 490, and 493) from 3 months to 12 years in a population-representative birth cohort of 8327 Hong Kong Chinese children., RESULTS: We did not find an association of exclusive breastfeeding for 3 months or more, compared with never breastfeeding, with hospitalization for asthma, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis to 12 years (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63-1.25) nor for partial breastfeeding for any length of time or exclusive breastfeeding for less than 3 months (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.86-1.21), adjusted for infant and parental characteristics and socioeconomic position. We also did not find an association of exclusive breastfeeding for 3 months or more with hospitalization for asthma only (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Version. Clinical Modification: 493) (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.82-1.98)., CONCLUSIONS: In a large population-representative Chinese birth cohort, we did not find an association of breastfeeding with childhood hospitalizations for asthma and other wheezing disorders.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Children born preterm or with a small size for gestational age are at increased risk for childhood asthma., OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the hypothesis that these associations are explained by reduced airway patency., METHODS: We used individual participant data of 24,938 children from 24 birth cohorts to examine and meta-analyze the associations of gestational age, size for gestational age, and infant weight gain with childhood lung function and asthma (age range, 3.9-19.1 years). Second, we explored whether these lung function outcomes mediated the associations of early growth characteristics with childhood asthma., RESULTS: Children born with a younger gestational age had a lower FEV1, FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio, and forced expiratory volume after exhaling 75% of vital capacity (FEF75), whereas those born with a smaller size for gestational age at birth had a lower FEV1 but higher FEV1/FVC ratio (P < .05). Greater infant weight gain was associated with higher FEV1 but lower FEV1/FVC ratio and FEF75 in childhood (P < .05). All associations were present across the full range and independent of other early-life growth characteristics. Preterm birth, low birth weight, and greater infant weight gain were associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma (pooled odds ratio, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.15-1.57], 1.32 [95% CI, 1.07-1.62], and 1.27 [95% CI, 1.21-1.34], respectively). Mediation analyses suggested that FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio, and FEF75 might explain 7% (95% CI, 2% to 10%) to 45% (95% CI, 15% to 81%) of the associations between early growth characteristics and asthma., CONCLUSIONS: Younger gestational age, smaller size for gestational age, and greater infant weight gain were across the full ranges associated with childhood lung function. These associations explain the risk of childhood asthma to a substantial extent. Copyright © 2015 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in identifying culturable allergenic fungi present in visible mould growth in energy efficient homes, and to identify risk factors for exposure to these known allergenic fungi. Swabs were taken from fungal contaminated surfaces and culturable yeasts and moulds isolated by using mycological culture. Soluble antigens from cultures were tested by ELISA using mAbs specific to the culturable allergenic fungi Aspergillus and Penicillium spp., Ulocladium, Alternaria, and Epicoccum spp., Cladosporium spp., Fusarium spp., and Trichoderma spp. Diagnostic accuracies of the ELISA tests were determined by sequencing of the internally transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1)-5.8S-ITS2-encoding regions of recovered fungi following ELISA. There was 100% concordance between the two methods, with ELISAs providing genus-level identity and ITS sequencing providing species-level identities (210 out of 210 tested). Species of Aspergillus/Penicillium, Cladosporium, Ulocladium/Alternaria/Epicoccum, Fusarium and Trichoderma were detected in 82% of the samples. The presence of condensation was associated with an increased risk of surfaces being contaminated by Aspergillus/Penicillium spp. and Cladosporium spp., whereas moisture within the building fabric (water ingress/rising damp) was only associated with increased risk of Aspergillus/Penicillium spp. Property type and energy efficiency levels were found to moderate the risk of indoor surfaces becoming contaminated with Aspergillus/Penicillium and Cladosporium which in turn was modified by the presence of condensation, water ingress and rising damp, consistent with previous literature.

N2  - Few epidemiological studies have investigated the role of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in the aetiology of childhood respiratory and atopic outcomes.In the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children we examined associations of maternal gestational hypertension, hypertension before pregnancy and pre-eclampsia with wheezing at 18 months, wheezing and asthma at 7 years and lung function at 8-9 years, after controlling for potential confounders (n=5322-8734, depending on outcome).Gestational hypertension was not associated with any of the outcomes. There was weak evidence for a positive association between pre-eclampsia and early wheezing (adjusted OR 1.31, 95% CI 0.94-1.82, compared to normotensive pregnancies) and for negative associations between pre-eclampsia and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (adjusted mean difference in sd score -0.14, 95% CI -0.33-0.06) and maximal mid-expiratory flow (-0.15, 95% CI -0.34-0.04). Hypertension before pregnancy was positively associated with wheezing (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.16-2.31) and asthma (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.00-1.79).Gestational hypertension is unlikely to be a risk factor for childhood respiratory disorders; hypertension before pregnancy may be a risk factor for childhood wheezing and asthma, but this finding needs replication. Larger studies are needed to confirm whether pre-eclampsia is associated with impaired childhood lung function. Copyright ©ERS 2016.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Asthma is the leading cause of emergency room visits in children, and those with asthma tend to suffer from more severe consequences of respiratory tract infections. The aims of this study were among children who required hospitalization, compare differences between those admitted with or without respiratory infection, describe changes in yearly proportion of asthma among the children admitted with a respiratory infection in New York City from 2006 to 2012 and ascertain how asthma affected the average length of hospital stay for those with respiratory infection., METHODS: We conducted an historical prospective study using data obtained from multiple electronic sources of patients discharged from a 200-bed pediatric hospital in a major metropolitan healthcare system between 2006 and 2012. Patient characteristics were obtained from electronic health records and billing codes., RESULTS: Among 83,348 patient discharges, there were 5057 (6.1%) with a respiratory infection. In the multivariable model, children with the following characteristics were significantly more likely to be admitted with a respiratory infection as compared with other diagnoses: asthma [odds ratio (OR) 4.68 (95% confidence limits (CL): 4.31, 5.08], male sex [OR:1.11 (1.05, 1.18)], prior hospitalization [OR: 3.65 (3.43, 3.89)], renal failure [(OR: 2.14 (1.70, 2.70)] and Medicaid coverage [OR: 1.93 (1.81, 2.05)]. Children aged >= 5 years (OR: 0.44 (0.41, 0.47) and those with diabetes (OR: 0.32 (0.21, 0.51) were less likely to be admitted with a respiratory infection. Hospitalized patients with respiratory infection and asthma, identified by ICD-9 codes, had significantly shorter lengths of stay than patients without asthma, 5.3 and 9.0 days, respectively, p < 0.001. Asthma in patients admitted with a respiratory infection increased from 19.2% in 2006 to 28.2% in 2012, peaking at 34.1% in 2010 (p < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: This study suggests that asthma is a significant risk factor for hospitalization of children with respiratory infection, and suggests that the prevalence of asthma is increasing over time among children hospitalized with respiratory infection in this urban setting.

N2  - Previous studies have found strong associations between asthma morbidity and major ambient air pollutants. Relatively little research has been conducted to assess whether age is a factor conferring susceptibility to air pollution-related asthma morbidity. We investigated the short-term relationships between asthma emergency department (ED) visits and ambient ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in Atlanta (1993-2009), Dallas (2006-2009), and St. Louis (2001-2007). City-specific daily time-series analyses were conducted to estimate associations by age group (0-4, 5-18, 19-39, 40-64, and 65+ years). Sub-analyses were performed stratified by race and sex. City-specific rate ratios (RRs) were combined by inverse-variance weighting to provide an overall association for each strata. The overall RRs differed across age groups, with associations for all pollutants consistently strongest for children aged 5-18 years. The patterns of association across age groups remained generally consistent when models were stratified by sex and race, although the strong observed associations among 5-18 year olds appeared to be partially driven by non-white and male patients. Our findings suggest that age is a susceptibility factor for asthma exacerbations in response to air pollution, with school-age children having the highest susceptibility.

N2  - Several epidemiological studies reported an association between antibiotic consumption in the first year of life and later asthma, but results are conflicting and affected by potential biases. We examined this controversial issue in a population-based birth cohort. Using administrative data, we identified 143,163 children born in 1995-2011 in Friuli-Venezia Giulia (Italy) (median follow-up 5.25 years, 927,350 person-years). Antibiotic prescriptions in the first year of life and subsequent treated asthma (defined as >=2 anti-asthmatic drug prescriptions within a 12-month period) were retrieved from drug prescription records. We estimated incidence rate ratios (IRR) using Poisson regression models, adjusted for perinatal variables and for hospitalizations for infections in the first year of life. We identified 34,957 new-onset asthma cases. Antibiotic consumption in the first year of life increased the risk of new-onset asthma [IRR 1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.48-1.54] with a dose-response relationship (p-trend <0.001). The risk was highest for asthma identified at 13-35 months of life (IRR 2.07, 95% CI 2.00-2.14), but remained statistically significant for asthma identified at 36-71 months (IRR 1.17, 95% CI 1.14-1.21) and at >=72 months (IRR 1.15, 95% CI 1.08-1.22). Antibiotics increased the risk of current asthma at >=6 years (IRR 1.35, 95% CI 1.30-1.41) and at >=13 years of age (IRR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08-1.33). Antibiotic exposure in infancy is associated with an increased risk of asthma up to adolescence. The association detected at older ages is not explained by reverse causation; however, confounding by respiratory infections not leading to hospital admission cannot be excluded.

N2  - Recent studies revealed common genetic risks for both viral bronchiolitis and asthma. Genome-wide association studies revealed that rs7216389 in the ORMDL3 gene is associated with childhood asthma. We conducted a case-control study examining the associations between ORMDL3 polymorphisms (rs7216389, rs12603332, and rs11650680) and bronchiolitis susceptibility/viral findings among 247 infant bronchiolitis cases and 190 healthy controls. We genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry and detected respiratory viruses with multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Only the genotype and allele frequencies of rs7216389 significantly differed between bronchiolitis and controls. The frequencies of the TT homozygote and the T allele of rs7216389 were significantly higher in the bronchiolitis patients (P = 0.0325; P = 0.0089, respectively). Polymorphisms were not associated with bronchiolitis severity. Cases were further stratified by viral infection, but no significant differences in the ORMDL3 genotype between the virus-detected group (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus alone, respiratory virus alone, virus detected) and no-virus-detected group were observed. Bronchiolitis is associated with the ORMDL3 gene in Chinese children, and there were no significant associations between genetic variations and disease severity or respiratory viruses. The TT homozygote and the T allele of rs7216389 in ORMDL3 increased bronchiolitis risk. The rs7216389 polymorphism may be a predictor for identifying infants with predisposition to virus-induced wheezing to persistent asthma.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest that maternal antibiotics exposure during pregnancy may increase the risk of childhood asthma, but the results were inconsistent. Furthermore, most studies did not examine periconception period as an exposure window. We aim to assess the associations between maternal exposure to specific antibiotics before and during pregnancy and the risk of asthma in early childhood., METHODS: Data from the Collaborative Perinatal Project were used. Maternal exposure to antibiotics before and during pregnancy was recorded at each prenatal visit. A total of 39,907 singleton children were followed up to 7 years of age. Multilevel multiple logistic regression models were used to control for potential confounders and account for multiple pregnancies per woman., RESULTS: Maternal use of penicillin or chloramphenicol was associated with an increased risk of asthma in the offspring (adjusted odds ratio = 1.21, 95% confidence interval 1.08-1.36 for penicillin; 1.72 [1.14-2.59] for chloramphenicol). The risk was significantly increased if penicillin or chloramphenicol was used in the 1st trimester (1.09 [1.04-1.13] for penicillin and 1.23 [1.01-1.51] for chloramphenicol)., CONCLUSION: Maternal exposure to certain antibiotics is associated with childhood asthma by 7 years of age. Early pregnancy may be a sensitive window.

N2  - We investigated the association between introduction of smoke-free legislation in the UK (March 2006 for Scotland, April 2007 for Wales and Northern Ireland, and July 2007 for England) and the incidence of respiratory diseases among children. We extracted monthly counts of new diagnoses of wheezing/asthma and RTIs among children aged 0-12 years from all general practices in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink during 1997-2012. Interrupted time series analyses were performed using generalised additive mixed models, adjusting for underlying incidence trends, population size changes, seasonal factors, and pandemic influenza, as appropriate. 366,642 new wheezing/asthma diagnoses and 4,324,789 RTIs were observed over 9,536,003 patient-years. There was no statistically significant change in the incidence of wheezing/asthma after introduction of smoke-free legislation in England (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.94, 95% CI 0.81-1.09) or any other UK country (Scotland: IRR 0.99, 95% CI 0.83-1.19; Wales: IRR 1.09, 95% CI 0.89-1.35; Northern Ireland: IRR 0.96, 95% CI 0.76-1.22). Similarly no statistically significant changes in RTI incidence were demonstrated (England: IRR 0.95, 95% CI 0.86-1.06; Scotland: IRR 0.96, 95% CI 0.83-1.11; Wales: IRR 0.97, 95% CI 0.86-1.09; Northern Ireland: IRR 0.90, 95% CI 0.79-1.03). There were no demonstrable reductions in the incidence of paediatric wheezing/asthma or RTIs following introduction of smoke-free legislation in the UK.

N1  - Comment in (CIN)
N2  - Asthma is the most prevalent pediatric chronic disease and affects more than 300 million people worldwide. Recent evidence in mice has identified a "critical window" early in life where gut microbial changes (dysbiosis) are most influential in experimental asthma. However, current research has yet to establish whether these changes precede or are involved in human asthma. We compared the gut microbiota of 319 subjects enrolled in the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) Study, and show that infants at risk of asthma exhibited transient gut microbial dysbiosis during the first 100 days of life. The relative abundance of the bacterial genera Lachnospira, Veillonella, Faecalibacterium, and Rothia was significantly decreased in children at risk of asthma. This reduction in bacterial taxa was accompanied by reduced levels of fecal acetate and dysregulation of enterohepatic metabolites. Inoculation of germ-free mice with these four bacterial taxa ameliorated airway inflammation in their adult progeny, demonstrating a causal role of these bacterial taxa in averting asthma development. These results enhance the potential for future microbe-based diagnostics and therapies, potentially in the form of probiotics, to prevent the development of asthma and other related allergic diseases in children.

Different studies have linked increased asthma symptoms, health care use, and deaths in children exposed to SHS, but the risk has not been quantified uniformly across studies., OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate and quantify asthma severity and health care use from SHS exposure in children., METHODS: A systematic review was undertaken to assess the association between asthma severity and SHS in children. Inclusion criteria included studies that evaluated children with SHS exposure and reported outcomes of interest with asthma severity including exacerbations. Random effect models were used to combine the outcomes of interest (hospitalization, emergency department or urgent care visits, severe asthma symptoms, wheeze symptoms, and pulmonary function test results) from the included studies., RESULTS: A total of 1,945 studies were identified and 25 studies met the inclusion criteria. Children with asthma and SHS exposure were twice as likely to be hospitalized for asthma (odds ratio [OR] 1.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-2.86, P = .01) than children with asthma but without SHS exposure. SHS exposure also was significantly associated with emergency department or urgent care visits (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.02-2.69, P = 0.04), wheeze symptoms (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.24, 1.41, P < .001), and lower ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity (OR -3.34, 95% CI -5.35 to -1.33, P = .001)., CONCLUSION: Children with asthma and SHS exposure are nearly twice as likely to be hospitalized with asthma exacerbation and are more likely to have lower pulmonary function test results.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about asthma trend in Morocco, particularly in early childhood. Furthermore, when dealing with asthma related environmental risk factors in Morocco, decision-making focus is in one region R9, while 16 regions make up the country. This work aims at studying 9-year trends in consultations for asthma in under-5 children in the 16 individual regions with respect to area and age group., METHODS: Direct method use, based on the only available national data from the open access files of the ministry of health, standardizing data for three age groups (0-11 ; 12-23 and 24-59 months). We compared age-adjusted rates, stratified by area (urban and rural areas) within each region (Wilcoxon's signed ranks test), and between all regions emphasizing on R9. Secular trends are examined (Kendall's rank correlation test). We also compared directly standardized rates as a rate ratio for two study populations (that of R9 and any region with highest rates). We finally compared rates by age group in selected regions., RESULTS: Secular increase in prevalence rates was shown in both urban and rural Morocco, particularly in urban areas of R10, R14, R16 and R5, and in rural areas of R14 and R16. In urban area of R10 (the highest age-adjusted prevalence rates area) the rates showed secular increase from 6.82 at 95 % CI = [6.44 to 7.19] per 1000 childhood population in 2004 to 20.91 at 95 % CI = [20.26 to 21.56] per 1000 childhood population in 2012 (P = 0.001). Rates were higher in urban than rural Morocco, particularly in R8, R9, R10, R14, R15 ; R6 was an exception. Rates in R10 were 1.63 higher than that in R9 in 2004 and rose to be 2.55 higher in 2012 ; rates in urban area of R14, about 3 times lower than that in R9 in 2004, increased to be similar in 2012. The highest-prevalence age group varied according to region and area., DISCUSSION: The regions that worth decision making attention are the urban areas of R10 (the highest prevalence rates Moroccan area, showing continuous increase), of R9, of R14 and the rural area of R6. The rates in the urban area of R9 (a current continuous decision making focus) remained high but stable within the study period and less important than those in R10. Environmental factors (biological particules, non-biological particules or gazes) are suspected.The potential unavailability of treatment at regular basis at the primary health care centers may reduce frequency of consultations for asthma in early childhood : outpatients may consult only if asthma causes problems in an attempt to get free medicines ; chances of outpatients' follow-up by the primary health care center's physicians are therefore reduced and optimal asthma control is not achieved., CONCLUSION: Social, health care policy and environmental factors, to which decision-making has to be responsive, are suspected to be affecting both frequency of and time secular trend in consultations for asthma in early childhood in Morocco.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Respiratory illnesses are the leading cause of pediatric hospitalizations in the United States, and a major focus of efforts to improve quality of care. Understanding factors associated with poor outcomes will allow better targeting of interventions for improving care. The objective of this study was to identify patient and hospital factors associated with prolonged length of stay (LOS) or complications during pediatric hospitalizations for asthma or lower respiratory infection (LRI)., METHODS: Cross-sectional study of hospitalizations of patients <18 years with asthma or LRI (bronchiolitis, influenza, or pneumonia) by using the nationally representative 2012 Kids Inpatient Database. We used multivariable logistic regression models to identify factors associated with prolonged LOS (>90th percentile) or complications (noninvasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation, or death)., RESULTS: For asthma hospitalizations(n = 85 320), risks for both prolonged LOS and complications were increased with each year of age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.07; AOR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.07, respectively for each outcome) and in children with chronic conditions (AOR 4.87, 95% CI 4.15-5.70; AOR 21.20, 95% CI 15.20-29.57, respectively). For LRI hospitalizations (n = 204 950), risks for prolonged LOS and complications were decreased with each year of age (AOR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97-0.98; AOR 0.95, 95% CI 0.94-0.96, respectively) and increased in children with chronic conditions (AOR 9.86, 95% CI 9.03-10.76; AOR 56.22, 95% CI 46.60-67.82, respectively). Risks for prolonged LOS for asthma were increased in large hospitals (AOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.32-2.11) and urban-teaching hospitals (AOR 1.62, 95% CI 1.33-1.97)., CONCLUSIONS: Older children with asthma, younger children with LRI, children with chronic conditions, and those hospitalized in large urban-teaching hospitals are more vulnerable to prolonged LOS and complications. Future research and policy efforts should evaluate and support interventions to improve outcomes for these high-risk groups (eg, hospital-based care coordination for children with chronic conditions).

N2  - Home-based asthma environmental education for parents of asthmatic children is needed since many health professionals lack the time to offer it. However, developing targeted and tailored education is important in order to address the individual needs of participants. This nonrandomized longitudinal study examined knowledge on asthma with an Asthma and Healthy Homes educational intervention training offered to parents of children from low income families who reside in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. Eighty-nine parents received the training and pre- and posttest surveys were used to measure knowledge outcomes. A standardized assessment on asthma triggers was used to identify the different triggers each child was exposed to, and a follow-up survey was conducted 6 months after the educational intervention to identify how many parents reported household and behavior changes as a result of the training. Results showed significant changes in behavior by participants as a result of the training received. This study suggests that these behavioral changes are attributed to the dual "targeted" and "tailored" educational interventions delivered to parents which resulted in a greater understanding of how to manage asthma by eliminating asthma triggers in their respective homes.

N2  - RATIONALE: The influence of particulate air pollution on respiratory health starts in utero. Fetal lung growth and structural development occurs in stages; thus, effects on postnatal respiratory disorders may differ based on timing of exposure., OBJECTIVES: We implemented an innovative method to identify sensitive windows for effects of prenatal exposure to particulate matter with a diameter less than or equal to 2.5 mum (PM2.5) on children's asthma development in an urban pregnancy cohort., METHODS: Analyses included 736 full-term (>=37 wk) children. Each mother's daily PM2.5 exposure was estimated over gestation using a validated satellite-based spatiotemporal resolved model. Using distributed lag models, we examined associations between weekly averaged PM2.5 levels over pregnancy and physician-diagnosed asthma in children by age 6 years. Effect modification by sex was also examined., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Most mothers were ethnic minorities (54% Hispanic, 30% black), had 12 or fewer years of education (66%), and did not smoke in pregnancy (80%). In the sample as a whole, distributed lag models adjusting for child age, sex, and maternal factors (education, race and ethnicity, smoking, stress, atopy, prepregnancy obesity) showed that increased PM2.5 exposure levels at 16-25 weeks gestation were significantly associated with early childhood asthma development. An interaction between PM2.5 and sex was significant (P = 0.01) with sex-stratified analyses showing that the association exists only for boys., CONCLUSIONS: Higher prenatal PM2.5 exposure at midgestation was associated with asthma development by age 6 years in boys. Methods to better characterize vulnerable windows may provide insight into underlying mechanisms.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is generally considered to be the initial step of the so-called atopic march, which following steps are allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma. There are few data about the progression of AD, including factors associated with the remission of AD in Asians and further research is needed., OBJECTIVE: To study the progression and factors associated with the remission of childhood AD diagnosed by pediatric dermatologists., METHODS: This study included 303 AD patients who visited the pediatric dermatology unit at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thailand, between 2002 and 2010. An interview, performed by a physician via telephone using a preformed questionnaire, was completed for 205 children., RESULTS: A total of 205 children were observed, with a median observation time of 5.2 (3.5-8.0) years, and an initial AD severity score of mild (61.0%), moderate (29.3%) and severe (9.7%). The prevalence of AD during the first two years of life was 64.4%. AD completely disappeared in 102 cases (49.8%) by the median age of 3.5 (1.5-7.8) years. Early onset and severity of AD were major determinant of prognosis. The prevalence of AR and asthma was 36.6%, and 9.3%, respectively. The risk factors associated with respiratory allergy were the onset of AD after aged two years, a family history of atopy, increased serum IgE level, and sensitization to inhalant allergens., CONCLUSIONS: Half of AD had completely disappeared at preschool age. Good prognosis was mostly determined by early onset AD and mild severity. Late onset, family history of atopy and increased serum IgE level are associated with respiratory allergy.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Early life farm exposures have been shown to decrease the risk of allergic diseases. Dendritic cells (DCs) may mediate asthma-protective effect of farm exposures as they play an important role in the development of immunity and tolerance. Our aim was to investigate whether the numbers and phenotypes of circulating DCs at age 6 are associated with farming, asthma, and atopy in a selected sample of French and Finnish children from the PASTURE study., METHODS: We studied 82 farm and 86 nonfarm children with and without asthma. Using flow cytometry, BDCA1+ CD11c+ myeloid DC1s (mDC1), BDCA3+(high) mDC2s and BDCA2+ plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) were identified and expressions of CD86, immunoglobulin-like transcript 3 (ILT3) and ILT4 were analyzed. Questionnaires were used to assess prenatal and lifetime patterns of farm exposures and to define asthma. Atopic sensitization was defined by specific IgE measurements., RESULTS: The percentage of mDC2 cells was lower in farm children (0.033 +/- 0.001) than in nonfarm children (0.042 +/- 0.001; P = 0.008). Similar associations were found between mDC2 percentage and prenatal (P = 0.02) and lifetime exposure to farm milk (P = 0.03) and stables (P = 0.003), but these associations were not independent from farming. Asthma was positively associated with ILT4 + mDCs (P = 0.04) and negatively with CD86 + pDCs (P = 0.048) but only in nonfarm children., CONCLUSIONS: Inverse association between farm exposure and mDC2 percentage suggest that this DC subset may play a role in farm-related immunoregulation.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Asthma is a heterogeneous disorder with different phenotypes, and age at onset may define part of them. Little is known about possible association between prenatal stress and asthma phenotypes according to age at onset. We aim to investigate whether there is an association between prenatal stress and asthma, and if so, whether such an association differs according to age at asthma onset., METHODS: We carried out a cohort study based on several national registers in Denmark, including all live singletons born during 1996-2007 in Denmark (N = 750,058). We identified children born to mothers who lost a close relative (a child, partner/spouse, a parent or a sibling) 1 year prior to or during pregnancy as the bereaved group. Using Cox proportional hazards regression model, we evaluated the hazard ratios (HRs) for asthma in children of bereaved mothers, compared with children of non-bereaved mothers., RESULTS: Prenatal stress following maternal bereavement was associated with a marginally increased risk of asthma events in children aged 0-3 years [HR = 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00-1.07], while unexpected bereavement was associated with a higher risk (HR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.02-1.24). There was no association between prenatal bereavement and asthma in children aged 4-15 years (HR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.96-1.09)., CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal stress is possibly associated with asthma events in children aged 0-3 years, but not with asthma in children aged 4-15 years irrespective of age at asthma onset.

N2  - RATIONALE: The timing and duration of traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) exposure may be important for childhood wheezing and asthma development., OBJECTIVES: We examined the relationship between TRAP exposure and longitudinal wheezing phenotypes and asthma at age 7 years., METHODS: Children completed clinical examinations annually from age 1 year through age 4 years and age 7 years. Parental-reported wheezing was assessed at each age, and longitudinal wheezing phenotypes (early-transient, late-onset, persistent) and asthma were defined at age 7 years. Participants' time-weighted exposure to TRAP, from birth through age 7 years, was estimated using a land-use regression model. The relationship between TRAP exposure and wheezing phenotypes and asthma was examined., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: High TRAP exposure at birth was significantly associated with both transient and persistent wheezing phenotypes (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-2.57 and aOR = 2.31; 95% CI, 1.28-4.15, respectively); exposure from birth to age 1 year and age 1 to 2 years was also associated with persistent wheeze. Only children with high average TRAP exposure from birth through age 7 years were at significantly increased risk for asthma (aOR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.01-2.88)., CONCLUSIONS: Early-life exposure to TRAP is associated with increased risk for persistent wheezing, but only long-term exposure to high levels of TRAP throughout childhood was associated with asthma development.

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the factors associated with asthma in children., METHODS: The case-control study was conducted in the paediatrics clinic of Lyari General Hospital, Karachi, from May to October 2010. Children 1-15 years of age attending the clinic represented the cases, while the control group had children who were closely related (sibling or cousin) to the cases but did not have the symptoms of disease at the time. Data was collected through a proforma and analysed using SPSS 10., RESULTS: Of the total 346 subjects, 173(50%) each comprised the two groups. According to univariable analysis the risk factors were presence of at least one smoker (odds ratio: 3.6; 95% confidence interval: 2.3-5.8), resident of kacha house (odds ratio: 16.2; 95% confidence interval: 3.8-69.5),living in room without windows (odds ratio: 9.3; 95% confidence interval: 2.1-40.9) and living in houses without adequate sunlight (odds ratio: 1.6; 95% confidence interval: 1.2-2.4).Using multivariable modelling, family history of asthma (odds ratio: 5.9; 95% confidence interval: 3.1-11.6), presence of at least one smoker at home (odds ratio: 4.1; 95% confidence interval: 2.3-7.2), people living in a room without a window (odds ratio: 5.5; 95% confidence interval: 1.15-26.3) and people living in an area without adequate sunlight (odds ratio: 2.2; 95% confidence interval: 1.13-4.31) were found to be independent risk factors of asthma in children adjusting for age, gender and history of weaning., CONCLUSIONS: Family history of asthma, children living with at least one smoker at home, room without windows and people living in an area without sunlight were major risk factors of childhood asthma.

N2  - Adverse childhood experiences such as abuse and neglect are associated with subsequent immune dysregulation. Some studies show an association between adverse childhood experiences and asthma onset, although significant disparity in results exists in the published literature. We aimed to review available studies employing a prospective design that investigates associations between adverse childhood experience and asthma. A search protocol was developed and studies were drawn from four electronic journal databases. Studies were selected in accordance with pre-set inclusion criteria and relevant data were extracted. 12 studies, assessing data from a total of 31 524 individuals, were identified that investigate the impact of a range of adverse childhood experiences on the likelihood of developing asthma. Evidence suggests that chronic stress exposure and maternal distress in pregnancy operate synergistically with known triggers such as traffic-related air pollution to increase asthma risk. Chronic stress in early life is associated with an increased risk of asthma onset. There is evidence that adverse childhood experience increases the impact of traffic-related air pollution and inconsistent evidence that adverse childhood experience has an independent effect on asthma onset.

N2  - This review focuses on the methods available for measuring reversible airways obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) and inflammation as hallmarks of asthma, and their role in monitoring children with asthma. Persistent bronchial obstruction may occur in asymptomatic children and is considered a risk factor for severe asthma episodes and is associated with poor asthma outcome. Annual measurement of forced expiratory volume in 1 s using office based spirometry is considered useful. Other lung function measurements including the assessment of BHR may be reserved for children with possible exercise limitations, poor symptom perception and those not responding to their current treatment or with atypical asthma symptoms, and performed on a higher specialty level. To date, for most methods of measuring lung function there are no proper randomised controlled or large longitudinal studies available to establish their role in asthma management in children. Noninvasive biomarkers for monitoring inflammation in children are available, for example the measurement of exhaled nitric oxide fraction, and the assessment of induced sputum cytology or inflammatory mediators in the exhaled breath condensate. However, their role and usefulness in routine clinical practice to monitor and guide therapy remains unclear, and therefore, their use should be reserved for selected cases. Copyright ©ERS 2015.

N2  - Management-related issues are an important aspect of monitoring asthma in children in clinical practice. This review summarises the literature on practical aspects of monitoring including adherence to treatment, inhalation technique, ongoing exposure to allergens and irritants, comorbid conditions and side-effects of treatment, as agreed by the European Respiratory Society Task Force on Monitoring Asthma in Childhood. The evidence indicates that it is important to discuss adherence to treatment in a non-confrontational way at every clinic visit, and take into account a patient's illness and medication beliefs. All task force members teach inhalation techniques at least twice when introducing a new inhalation device and then at least annually. Exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke, combustion-derived air pollutants, house dust mites, fungal spores, pollens and pet dander deserve regular attention during follow-up according to most task force members. In addition, allergic rhinitis should be considered as a cause for poor asthma control. Task force members do not screen for gastro-oesophageal reflux and food allergy. Height and weight are generally measured at least annually to identify individuals who are susceptible to adrenal suppression and to calculate body mass index, even though causality between obesity and asthma has not been established. In cases of poor asthma control, before stepping up treatment the above aspects of monitoring deserve closer attention. Copyright ©ERS 2015.

N2  - Monitoring asthma in children in clinical practice is primarily performed by reviewing disease activity (daytime and night-time symptoms, use of reliever medication, exacerbations requiring frequent use of reliever medication and urgent visits to the healthcare professional) and the impact of the disease on children's daily activities, including sports and play, in a clinical interview. In such an interview, most task force members also discuss adherence to maintenance therapy and the patients' (and parents') views and beliefs on the goals of treatment and the amount of treatment required to achieve those goals. Composite asthma control and quality of life measures, although potentially useful in research, have limited value in clinical practice because they have a short recall window and do not cover the entire spectrum of asthma control. Telemonitoring of children with asthma cannot replace face-to-face follow-up and monitoring because there is no evidence that it is associated with improved health outcomes. Copyright ©ERS 2015.

N2  - The goal of asthma treatment is to obtain clinical control and reduce future risks to the patient. However, to date there is limited evidence on how to monitor patients with asthma. Childhood asthma introduces specific challenges in terms of deciding what, when, how often, by whom and in whom different assessments of asthma should be performed. The age of the child, the fluctuating course of asthma severity, variability in clinical presentation, exacerbations, comorbidities, socioeconomic and psychosocial factors, and environmental exposures may all influence disease activity and, hence, monitoring strategies. These factors will be addressed in herein. We identified large knowledge gaps in the effects of different monitoring strategies in children with asthma. Studies into monitoring strategies are urgently needed, preferably in collaborative paediatric studies across countries and healthcare systems. Copyright ©ERS 2015.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract infection (LRI) during infancy has been consistently associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma. In addition, evidence supports that this relationship is causal. However, the mechanisms through which RSV contributes to asthma development are not understood. The INSPIRE (Infant Susceptibility to Pulmonary Infections and Asthma Following RSV Exposure) study objectives are to: 1) characterize the host phenotypic response to RSV infection in infancy and the risk of recurrent wheeze and asthma, 2) identify the immune response and lung injury patterns of RSV infection that are associated with the development of early childhood wheezing illness and asthma, and 3) determine the contribution of specific RSV strains to early childhood wheezing and asthma development. This article describes the INSPIRE study, including study aims, design, recruitment results, and enrolled population characteristics., METHODS/DESIGN: The cohort is a population based longitudinal birth cohort of term healthy infants enrolled during the first months of life over a two year period. Respiratory infection surveillance was conducted from November to March of the first year of life, through surveys administered every two weeks. In-person illness visits were conducted if infants met pre-specified criteria for a respiratory illness visit. Infants will be followed annually to ages 3-4 years for assessment of the primary endpoint: wheezing illness. Nasal, urine, stool and blood samples were collected at various time points throughout the study for measurements of host and viral factors that predict wheezing illness. Nested case-control studies will additionally be used to address other primary and secondary hypotheses., DISCUSSION: In the INSPIRE study, 1952 infants (48% female) were enrolled during the two enrollment years and follow-up will continue through 2016. The mean age of enrollment was 60 days. During winter viral season, more than 14,000 surveillance surveys were carried out resulting in 2,103 respiratory illness visits on 1189 infants. First year follow-up has been completed on over 95% percent of participants from the first year of enrollment. With ongoing follow-up for wheezing and childhood asthma outcomes, the INSPIRE study will advance our understanding of the complex causal relationship between RSV infection and early childhood wheezing and asthma.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The occurrence of allergic multimorbidity (coexistence of asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema) has not been evaluated longitudinally from early childhood up to adulthood in a population-based study sample. We aimed to determine the prevalence of allergic multimorbidity up to age 20 stratified by parental allergies and sex/gender using extensive prospective follow-up data from two decades of a birth cohort study., METHODS: In 1990, we recruited 1314 healthy newborns from 6 maternity wards across Germany for the population-based MAS birth cohort study. The sample was purposely risk-enriched by increasing the proportion of children at high allergy risk (i.e. at least 2 allergic family members among parents and siblings) from 19% in the source population to 38% in the final sample. The remaining 62% of all MAS children had a low or no allergy risk. Symptoms, medication and doctor's diagnoses of allergic diseases have been assessed using standardized questionnaires including validated ISAAC questions in 19 follow-up assessments up to age 20. Allergic multimorbidity at each time point was defined as the coexistence of at least 2 of the following diseases in one participant: asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema., RESULTS: Response at age 20 was 72% (n = 942) of all recruited participants. At age 20, 18.5% (95% CI, 15.0-22.5%) of all participants with allergic parents had 2 or 3 concurrent allergies as compared to only 6.3% (95% CI, 4.3-9.0%) of those with non-allergic parents. At this age, allergic multimorbidity was similar in women and men (12.7% (95% CI, 9.7-16.2%) vs. 11.6% (95% CI, 8.9-14.8%)), whereas single allergic diseases were slightly more common in women than men (24.2% (95% CI, 20.2-28.5%) vs. 20.1% (95% CI, 16.6-24.0%)). Asthma occurred more frequently with coexisting allergic rhinitis and/or eczema than as a single entity from pre-puberty to adulthood., CONCLUSION: Having parents with allergies is not only a strong predictor to develop any allergy, but it strongly increases the risk of developing allergic multimorbidity. In males and females alike, coexisting allergies were increasingly common throughout adolescence up to adulthood. Particularly asthma occurred in both sexes more frequently with coexisting allergies than as a single entity. Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is one of the most common chronic diseases, usually starting in the first 2 decades of life. Information on predictors, risk, and protective factors is missing because of a lack of long-term prospective studies., OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to examine early-life environmental and lifestyle determinants for AR up to age 20 years., METHODS: In 1990, the Multicenter Allergy Study included 1314 newborns in 5 German cities. Children were evaluated at 19 time points. A Cox regression model examined the associations between 41 independent early-life factors and onset of AR (as the primary outcome), including sensitization against aeroallergens and the secondary outcomes of nonallergic rhinitis and AR plus asthma., RESULTS: Two hundred ninety subjects had AR within 13,179 person years observed. The risk of AR was higher with a parental history of AR (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.49; 95% CI, 1.93-3.21), urticaria (aHR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.00-1.74), or asthma (aHR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.95-1.75). Early allergic sensitization (aHR, 4.53; 95% CI, 3.25-6.32), eczema within the first 3 years of life (aHR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.38-2.42), male sex (aHR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.02-1.61), and birthday in summer or autumn (aHR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.00-1.58) were independent predictors of AR up to age 20 years. None of the other socioeconomic, environmental, lifestyle, pregnancy, and birth-related factors were associated with AR., CONCLUSION: Only nonmodifiable factors, particularly early allergic sensitization or eczema and parental AR, predicted AR up to age 20 years. No modifiable aspects of early-life environment or lifestyle were identified as targets for primary prevention. Copyright © 2015 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There has been recent interest in understanding the origins of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Epidemiological studies suggest that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease clearly has other causes apart from tobacco smoke., RECENT FINDINGS: Cross-sectional studies of adult cohorts with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease highlight that childhood asthma is a risk factor. A recent longitudinal childhood cohort study of children from childhood to the age of 50 years describes that children with severe asthma are at increased risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and that the deficit in lung function can be tracked back to early years., SUMMARY: Children with severe asthma are at increased risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The risk of asthma, specifically in former late preterm infants, has not been well defined. Covariate imbalance and lack of controlling for this has led to inconsistent results in prior studies., OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the risk of asthma in former late preterm infants using a propensity score approach., METHODS: The study was a population-based birth cohort study. Study subjects were all children born in Rochester, Minn, between 1976 and 1982. Asthma status during the first 7 years of life was assessed by applying predetermined criteria. The propensity score was formulated using 15 covariates by fitting a logistic regression model for late preterm birth versus term birth. We applied the propensity score method to match late preterm infants (34 0/7 to 36 6/7 weeks of gestation) to term infants (37 0/7 to 40 6/7 weeks of gestation) within a caliper of 0.2 standard deviation of logit of propensity score., RESULTS: Of the eligible 7040 infants, 5915 children had complete data. Before propensity score matching, late preterm infants had a higher risk of asthma (20 of 262, 7.6%) compared with full-term infants (272 of 5653, 4.8%) (P = .039). There was significant covariate imbalance between comparison groups. After matching with propensity scores, we found that former late preterm infants had a similar risk of asthma to the matched full-term infants (6.6% vs 7.7%, respectively, P = .61), and the result was consistent with covariate-adjustment Cox regression models controlling for significant covariates (P = .57)., CONCLUSION: A late preterm birth history is not independently associated with childhood asthma, as the reported risk of asthma among former late preterm infants appears to be due to covariate imbalance.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Evidence relating to the effect of asthma on puberty or height is inconclusive. We aimed to examine whether the exposure of childhood asthma, including timing and phenotypes, and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use is either cross-sectionally or longitudinally associated with the outcomes of pubertal staging or height., METHODS: This study employed data from a longitudinal, population-based cohort of Swedish children (born 1994-1996). At ages 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 years, parent-reported data on asthma and ICS use in the previous 12 months were collected. At 8 and 12 years, height was ascertained at a clinical visit, and child-reported, respectively. At 12 years, children answered puberty-related questions., RESULTS: Retention through 12 years was 82% (3366/4089). Participants without puberty data (n = 620) were excluded, yielding a study population of 2746 (67%). Asthma at 8 years, including timing of onset and phenotypes, was not statistically significantly associated with pubertal staging in adjusted models. Children with asthma averaged 0.93 cm (95% CI 0.35-1.50) shorter than children without asthma. Children with asthma using ICS were 1.28 (95% CI 0.62-1.95) shorter than those with asthma without using ICS., CONCLUSIONS: We found no consistent association between asthma and pubertal staging. Children with asthma were shorter than those without asthma. Moreover, children with asthma using ICS were shorter than those not using ICS. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure and length of stay (LOS) and other exacerbation severity indicators in children hospitalized for asthma., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review at 2 children's hospitals. Patients aged 2 to 18 hospitalized for asthma in 2012 were included. Outcome variables included LOS, PICU, magnesium, and intravenous (IV) steroids. Bivariate analysis determined differences between SHS-exposed and non-SHS-exposed groups. Geometric means were used for LOS to account for skewed distribution. Logistic and zero-truncated negative binomial regression models were used to determine the independent association between SHS exposure and hospitalization severity indicators., RESULTS: A total of 623 patients were included; 41% reported SHS exposure. Mean LOS was 47.5 hours. In the SHS-exposed group, LOS was 50.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 46.7-54.0) and in the nonexposed group it was 45.8 (95% CI 43.4-48.4) (P = .02). In regression analysis, institution modified the effect of SHS exposure on LOS. At Children's Hospital Colorado, SHS exposure was associated with a 20% increase in LOS (incidence rate ratio 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.3). At the Medical University of South Carolina, there was no significant association. SHS-exposed patients were more likely to receive IV steroids (odds ratio 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.3) CONCLUSIONS: Among children hospitalized for asthma, we identified a significant association at 1 institution between SHS exposure and LOS and found that IV steroid use was significantly associated with LOS at both institutions. Eliminating SHS exposure among children with asthma is important. Copyright © 2015 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

N2  - The relationship between coeliac disease and asthma has been scarcely investigated. Infant antibiotic exposure has been linked to both diseases. We evaluated the association between childhood coeliac disease and asthma and the role of antibiotics in the first year of life. We followed a cohort of children born in 1995-2011 in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region (Italy). Prescriptions for antibiotics in the first year of life and subsequent treated asthma were retrieved from drug prescription records; coeliac disease incident cases were identified from pathology reports, hospital discharges and exemption from prescription charges for clinical tests. We estimated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) using multivariate Poisson regression models. Among the 143,144 children, we identified 717 coeliac children and 34,969 asthmatics. Children with asthma were at increased risk of coeliac disease (IRR 1.46, 95% CI 1.25-1.67). Restricting the analysis to asthma that occurred before the diagnosis of coeliac disease, the excess risk disappeared, except for coeliac disease diagnosed after 5 years of age (IRR 1.37, 95% CI 1.09-1.71). Antibiotics were not a confounding factor in these associations. Childhood treated asthma and coeliac disease are significantly associated. This association is not confounded by antibiotic exposure in the first year of life and may be explained by other shared risk factors. Copyright ©ERS 2015.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Observationally, delivery by Caesarean section is associated with higher risk of childhood asthma and wheeze in developed Western settings, but associations are less consistent in other settings., OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of mode of delivery with hospitalizations for asthma and other wheezing disorders in a developed non-Western setting with high rates of Caesarean section., METHODS: Using Cox regression, we examined the adjusted association of mode of delivery with public hospital admissions for asthma, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Version Clinical Modification 466, 490 and 493) from 9 days to 12 years of age in a population-representative prospective birth cohort of 8327 Chinese children in Hong Kong. Confounders included sex, birth and parental characteristics, and socio-economic position (SEP)., RESULTS: Delivery by Caesarean section accounted for 27% of all births and was not clearly associated with hospitalizations for asthma and other wheezing disorders to 12 years [hazard ratio (HR) 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.36] compared to vaginal delivery. Similarly, there were no clear associations to 2 years (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.38) or 6 years (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.37), although we cannot rule out residual confounding by SEP., CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: We cannot rule out an association, but our findings suggest that the observed associations of delivery by Caesarean section with childhood wheezing disorders may vary with setting and may not be biologically mediated. Further studies with different designs are needed to clarify the role of the microbiome and mode of delivery in the aetiology of asthma and other childhood wheezing disorders.

N2  - Animal furs might represent a "proxy" for high and diverse microbial exposures within a critical time window of immune development. We assessed whether sleeping on animal fur shortly after birth is associated with asthma and atopy up to the age of 10 years. LISAplus participants (n=2441) from Munich and Leipzig, Germany, were included in the analysis. Animal fur exposure, cofactors and health outcomes were obtained periodically up to 10 years of age by parental questionnaires. Information on specific IgE to aeroallergens was available at 10 years. Cytokine-producing peripheral T-cells were assessed in a subgroup of children at 2 and 3 years. Confounder-adjusted associations were evaluated using logistic regression analyses. Sleeping on animal fur was very common (55%). In adjusted logistic regression analyses, sleeping on animal fur was inversely associated with recurrent early wheezing at 4 years (adjusted OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61-0.93) and current asthma at 6 years (adjusted OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.31-1.01). Furthermore, sleeping on animal fur during the first 3 months of life was significantly associated with a persistently stimulated interferon-gamma response until the age of 3 years. Animal fur could be an effective measure of creating environments associated with higher microbial exposure. Copyright ©ERS 2015.

N2  - BACKGROUND: While much is known about childhood atopic dermatitis, little is known about persistence of atopic dermatitis into adult life. We report, to our knowledge for the first time, the clinical course of atopic dermatitis in an unselected cohort of adolescents followed into adulthood., METHODS: The course of atopic dermatitis from adolescence to adulthood was studied prospectively in a cohort of unselected 8th-grade schoolchildren established in 1995 and followed up in 2010 with questionnaire and clinical examination., RESULTS: The lifetime prevalence of atopic dermatitis was high (34.1%), and a considerable number of adults still suffered from atopic dermatitis evaluated both by questionnaire (17.1%) and clinical examination (10.0%). Persistent atopic dermatitis was found in 50% of those diagnosed in school age, and persistent atopic dermatitis was significantly associated with early onset, childhood allergic rhinitis and hand eczema. A close association was also found with allergic contact dermatitis and increased specific IgE to Malassezia furfur, but not with filaggrin gene defect., CONCLUSION: Persistence of atopic dermatitis in adulthood is common and affects quality of life. Persistent atopic dermatitis is particularly prevalent in those with early onset, allergic rhinitis and hand eczema in childhood. It is important to recognizing atopic dermatitis as a common and disabling disease not only in children but also in adults. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

N2  - AIM: Being overweight has been associated with the risk of developing childhood asthma, but studies have produced conflicting results, for example with regard to possible links to allergic diseases. This study aimed to explore the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and school-age asthma., METHODS: Data were obtained from a prospective, longitudinal study of 5044 children born in western Sweden. The parents answered questionnaires at six months and one, four-and-a-half and eight years of age. The response rate to the final questionnaire at the age of eight was just over 80%. BMI was adjusted for age and gender, and a high BMI was defined as the 85th percentile and above., RESULTS: A multivariate analysis showed an independently increased risk of doctor-diagnosed asthma among children with a persistently high BMI, both in infancy and at school age, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 2.9 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.3-6.4. In addition, persistently high BMI was associated with an increased risk of atopic asthma (aOR 4.7, 95% CI 2.0-11.0)., CONCLUSION: A persistently high BMI during childhood increased the risk of doctor-diagnosed asthma at school age. The increased risk of atopic asthma suggests an effect mediated via the immune system. Copyright ©2015 The Authors.

N2  - The aim of this general review is to investigate the influence of active and passive smoking on the development of asthma in children and adults. Passive smoking during and after pregnancy facilitates the onset of childhood asthma and wheezing. In particular, smoking during pregnancy is associated with the occurrence of wheezing prior to the age of 4 years. In contrast, the results of studies on the relationship between parental smoking in the post-natal period and the onset of asthma or wheezing are discordant. Exposure to passive smoking during childhood facilitates the occurrence of asthma in adulthood. In adults and adolescents, active smoking appears to be a factor favoring the development of asthma. On the other hand, non-smoking adult subjects without history of asthma exposed to passive smoking have a risk of asthma. The pathophysiological mechanisms by which tobacco smoke is the cause of asthma are still poorly known. Smoking cessation is an essential component in the management of asthmatic subjects who smoke, facilitating the control of the disease. Copyright © 2014 SPLF. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence, current treatment, and clinical characteristics of asthma, as well as the risk factors for this disease, among children aged 0-14 years in 2010 in urban Zhongshan, China., METHODS: A total of 10 336 children aged 0-14 years were selected from urban Zhongshan by cluster random sampling. The Third National Childhood Asthma Epidemiological Questionnaire 2010 was used to analyze the prevalence, current treatment, and clinical characteristics of childhood asthma, as well as the risk factors for this disease., RESULTS: Asthma was diagnosed in 179 cases (1.73%). The prevalence of asthma in male children was significantly higher than that in female children (2.25% vs 1.16%; P<0.01). Of the 179 patients, severe attacks were common in 104 cases (58.1%), 110 cases (61.5%) had slow onset, 102 cases (57.0%) had gradually relieved conditions, 61 cases (34.1%) suffered from asthma during seasonal transition, and 150 cases (83.8%) developed asthma due to respiratory tract infection. Among all asthmatic children, 71.5% had been treated with inhaled corticosteroids, and 71.5% had been treated with bronchodilator. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a history of penicillin allergy, a family history of allergy, food allergy, eczema, allergic rhinitis, cesarean delivery, family mould, and perinatal passive smoking were independent risk factors for childhood asthma., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of childhood asthma in urban Zhongshan is on a high level, and is associated with gender. The treatment of asthma has been standardized, but still needs further improvement. The onset of asthma attack is influenced by various factors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Gut microbiota and intestinal inflammation regulate the development of immune-mediated diseases, such as allergies. Fecal calprotectin is a biomarker of intestinal inflammation., OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the association of early-age fecal calprotectin levels to the later development of allergic diseases in children from farming and non-farming environments and further studied the effect of gut microbiota on the fecal calprotectin levels., METHODS: Fecal calprotectin was measured from 758 infants participating in the PASTURE study at the age of 2 months using the ELISA method. Serum-specific IgE levels were measured at 6 years of age. Data of environmental factors, doctor-diagnosed atopic dermatitis (AD) and asthma were collected by questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regression models were used for analysis. The composition of fecal microbiota was analysed in a subgroup of 120 infants with 16S rRNA pyrosequencing. The effect of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on in vitro monocyte IL-10 secretion was studied by flow cytometry., RESULTS: The infants with high fecal calprotectin levels at 2 months, that is above the 90th percentile, had an increased risk of developing AD and asthma/asthmatic bronchitis by the age of 6 years (aOR 2.02 (1.06-3.85) and 2.41 (1.25-4.64), respectively). High fecal calprotectin levels correlated negatively with fecal Escherichia. LPS from E. coli stimulated production of IL-10 in monocytes., CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: High degree intestinal inflammation at 2 months of age, detected as high fecal calprotectin, predicted asthma and AD by the age of 6 years and was linked to low abundance of fecal Escherichia. Impaired IL-10 activation due to the lack of colonization with E. coli could explain the intestinal inflammation associated high fecal calprotectin and later risk of asthma and AD. Our results have implications for the design of probiotic treatments and suggest that early intestinal colonization has long-term health effects. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoke exposure has been associated with early childhood asthma symptoms. We assessed the associations of tobacco smoke exposure during pregnancy and childhood with wheezing patterns, asthma, airway interrupter resistance (Rint), and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (Feno) in school-age children and whether birth characteristics explained the associations., METHODS: This study was embedded in a population-based prospective cohort study among 6,007 children. Paternal and maternal smoking during pregnancy (never, first trimester only, continued), secondhand tobacco smoke exposure during childhood, wheezing patterns, and asthma were prospectively assessed by questionnaires. Wheezing patterns were defined as never, early (<= 3 years only), late (> 3 years only), and persistent (<= 3 and > 3 years) wheezing. Rint and Feno were measured at age 6 years. Birth characteristics were available from registries., RESULTS: Continued maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with increased risks of early and persistent wheezing (OR: 1.24 [1.01, 1.52]; 1.48 [1.13, 1.95]) and asthma (1.65 [1.07, 2.55], for at least five cigarettes per day), but not with Rint or Feno. Birth characteristics did not explain these associations. Childhood tobacco smoke exposure was associated with higher Rint (difference z score: 0.45 [0.00, 0.90]), but this effect attenuated after adjustment for birth characteristics. Maternal smoking during first trimester only or paternal smoking during pregnancy was not associated with Rint, Feno, wheezing, or asthma., CONCLUSIONS: Continued maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with increased risks of asthma outcomes in school-age children, whereas childhood tobacco smoke exposure was associated with higher Rint. Birth characteristics may explain part of these associations.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Concerns have been raised regarding cardiac side effects of continuous high-dose albuterol nebulization in status asthmaticus management. Our study goal was to determine prevalence and potential risk factors for hypotension development during continuous albuterol administration in pediatric patients., METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital from 1 January 2011 to 31 August 2012. A total of 152 patients admitted to pediatric intensive or intermediate care units who received continuous albuterol nebulization for management of status asthmaticus were analyzed., RESULTS: Diastolic hypotension, defined as a value < 50 mmHg or <5th percentile of normal for age, developed in 90% of patients and a positive correlation with increasing doses of albuterol was demonstrated. The overall median time to onset of hypotension was 4 h (interquartile range (IQR): 2-6.5) and was significantly lower among patients admitted to the intensive care unit rather than intermediate care (p = 0.005). The odds of hypotension were 82% lower among patients who received fluid boluses prior to continuous albuterol nebulization. None of the potential risk factors demonstrated statistical significance., CONCLUSIONS: Diastolic hypotension is a common occurrence among patients who receive continuous albuterol nebulization for status asthmaticus. Total albuterol dose appeared to be directly related to risk of developing diastolic hypotension. Administration of supplemental fluid boluses before continuous nebulized albuterol appeared to provide a significant protective effect. The clinical impact and the significance of diastolic hypotension and the importance of prophylactic administration of intravenous fluid boluses in patients experiencing status asthmaticus are yet to be determined.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Diminished lung function and increased prevalence of asthma have been reported in children with a history of early lower respiratory illnesses (LRIs), including pneumonia. Whether these associations persist up to adulthood has not been established., METHODS: As part of the prospective Tucson Children's Respiratory Study, LRIs during the first 3 years of life were ascertained by pediatricians. Spirometry was performed at ages 11, 16, 22, and 26 years. The occurrence of asthma/wheeze during the previous year was ascertained at ages 11, 13, 16, 18, 22, 24, 26, and 29 years. Longitudinal random effects models and generalized estimating equations were used to assess the relation of LRIs to lung function and asthma., RESULTS: Compared with participants without early-life LRIs, those with pneumonia had the most severe subsequent lung function impairment, with mean +/- SE deficits of -3.9% +/- 0.9% (P < .001) and -2.5% +/- 0.8% (P = .001) for pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV1:FVC ratio from age 11 to 26 years, respectively. Pneumonia was associated with increased risk for asthma (odds ratio [OR]: 1.95; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-3.44) and wheeze (OR: 1.94; 95% CI: 1.28-2.95) over the same age range. Early non-pneumonia LRIs were associated with mildly impaired pre-bronchodilator FEV1 (-62.8 +/- 27.9 mL, P = .024) and FEV1:FVC ratio (-1.1 +/- 0.5%, P = .018), and wheeze (OR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.09-1.72)., CONCLUSIONS: Early pneumonia is associated with asthma and impaired airway function, which is partially reversible with bronchodilators and persists into adulthood. Early pneumonia may be a major risk factor for adult chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Copyright © 2015 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Excess moisture and visible mold are associated with increased risk of asthma. Only a few studies have performed detailed home visits to characterize the extent and location of moisture damage and mold growth., METHODS: Structured home inspections were performed in a birth cohort study when the children were 5 months old (on average). Children (N = 398) were followed up to the age of 6 years. Specific immunoglobulin E concentrations were determined at 6 years., RESULTS: Moisture damage and mold at an early age in the child's main living areas (but not in bathrooms or other interior spaces) were associated with the risk of developing physician-diagnosed asthma ever, persistent asthma, and respiratory symptoms during the first 6 years. Associations with asthma ever were strongest for moisture damage with visible mold in the child's bedroom (adjusted odds ratio: 4.82 [95% confidence interval: 1.29-18.02]) and in the living room (adjusted odds ratio: 7.51 [95% confidence interval: 1.49-37.83]). Associations with asthma ever were stronger in the earlier part of the follow-up and among atopic children. No consistent associations were found between moisture damage with or without visible mold and atopic sensitization., CONCLUSIONS: Moisture damage and mold in early infancy in the child's main living areas were associated with asthma development. Atopic children may be more susceptible to the effects of moisture damage and mold. Copyright © 2015 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Sex influences the risk of wheezing illnesses and the prevalence of asthma throughout childhood., OBJECTIVE: To better understand the mechanisms of these effects, we analyzed longitudinal relationships between sex, lung physiology, and asthma in the Childhood Origins of ASThma birth cohort study., METHODS: Childhood Origins of ASThma birth cohort study children were followed prospectively from birth and assessed annually. Results of spirometry, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (Feno), mannitol provocation testing, and (3)He gas magnetic resonance imaging were assessed by sex using multivariate models including age, asthma diagnosis, and wheezing histories., RESULTS: Girls had higher prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 0.5 seconds/forced vital capacity values than did boys (mean difference, 0.017; 95% CI, 0.000-0.034; P = .05) of equivalent age. Postbronchodilator findings were more pronounced, with boys demonstrating reduced forced expiratory volume in 0.5 seconds/forced vital capacity values than did girls of equivalent age (mean difference, 0.032; 95% CI, 0.014-0.049; P = .0005). Conversely, girls were noted to have higher ventilation defects on (3)He magnetic resonance imaging than did boys (P = .01). No differences were noted in the rate of positive responses to mannitol provocation or Feno measurements., CONCLUSIONS: Lower airflow values are present by spirometry for prepubertal boys than for age-matched girls; however, greater (3)He ventilation defects were noted in girls. This could represent a greater degree of subclinical air trapping in prepubertal girls because residual volumes are not detected on standard spirometric readings. No differences were noted between the 2 sexes with airway hyperresponsiveness (mannitol provocation testing) or inflammation (Feno). Prospective peripubertal follow-up will determine whether these differences persist or change with the de novo expression and remission of asthma based on sex and age.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the association between maternal socioeconomic status (SES) during pregnancy and asthma among offspring., METHODS: A retrospective observational hospital-based birth cohort study in a university-based Obstetrics and Gynecology department in Finland. A total of 40 118 women with singleton live births between 1989 and 2007 were linked with data from the register for asthma medication for their offspring (n = 2518). Pregnancy and maternal SES factors were recorded during pregnancy and labor. SES was categorized thus: upper white-collar workers (highest SES), lower white-collar workers, blue-collar workers, others (lowest SES) and cases with missing information. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association between maternal SES and childhood asthma., RESULTS: We found no convincing evidence of a direct association between maternal SES and childhood asthma. Parental smoking was the clearest factor affecting asthma among children of lower white-collar workers. Differences in pregnancy and delivery characteristics were observed between the SES groups., CONCLUSIONS: Maternal socioeconomic status had no significant direct impact on the prevalence of asthma in this Finnish birth cohort. Finnish public health services appeared to offer equal quality services independently of SES., TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study is registered in Kuopio University Hospital register (TUTKI): ID 5302448 .

N2  - HealthNuts is a single-centre, multi-wave, population-based longitudinal study designed to assess prevalence, determinants, natural history and burden of allergy (particularly food allergy) in the early years of life. It is novel in the use of serial food challenge measures within its population frame to confirm food allergy. The cohort comprises 5276 children initially recruited at age 12 months from council-run immunization sessions across Melbourne, Australia. As well as parent-completed questionnaires and researcher-observed eczema status, all infants underwent skin-prick testing to egg, peanut, sesame and either cow's milk or shellfish, and those with detectable wheals underwent food challenges to determine clinical allergy. In wave 2, conducted at age 4 years, validated questionnaires collected data on asthma, allergic rhinitis (hay fever), eczema and food allergies. Food challenges were repeated in children previously identified as food allergic to determine resolution. In wave 3, all children (irrespective of food allergy status) were invited for clinical assessment at age 6 years, including lung function, physical measurements, skin-prick testing to foods and aeroallergens and food challenges if food sensitized. Biological specimens (blood, cheek swabs) were collected at each wave for ancillary immunological, genetic and epigenetic studies.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Growing evidence has revealed a link between autoimmune and allergic diseases. However, few studies have assessed the relationship between allergic diseases and primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), an autoimmune disease frequently occurring in children. This population-based case-control study investigated the association between common allergic diseases and the subsequent risk of developing ITP during childhood., METHODS: This study investigated 1,203 children younger than 18 y of age who were diagnosed with ITP between 1998 and 2008, as well as 4,812 frequency-matched controls. The odds ratios of the association between ITP and preexisting allergic diseases were calculated., RESULTS: Children with every type of allergic disease examined in this study (except asthma) exhibited an increased risk of developing ITP; the lowest adjusted odds ratio (aOR) was 1.39 for allergic conjunctivitis (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.09-1.79), whereas the greatest aOR was 1.84 for allergic rhinitis (95% CI = 1.49-2.27). The aORs increased with the number of concurrent allergic diseases to 2.89 (95% CI = 1.98-4.22) for children with at least three allergic diseases., CONCLUSION: Children with atopic diathesis have a greater risk of subsequently developing ITP. The fundamental determinants of this relationship warrant further study.

N2  - Previous research has generally found exclusive breastfeeding to protect against asthma in young children. However, maternal nativity in a Latina population has not been assessed as a potential confounder or effect modifier. Using cross-sectional data restricted to Latina mothers (n = 704) from a birth cohort in Los Angeles interviewed in 2003 and 2006, we estimated risk ratios (RR) for exclusive breastfeeding and asthmatic symptoms in the offspring. 56 children (8%) had asthmatic symptoms at age 3.5 years. We found a 49% reduction in risk of asthmatic symptoms with >3 months of exclusive breastfeeding (aRR 0.51, 95% CI 0.28, 0.90). Foreign-born Latinas were more likely to initiate and continue breastfeeding for at least 3 months compared with US-born Latinas. Three or more months of exclusive breastfeeding reduced the risk of asthmatic symptoms in the offspring of Latinas, and maternal nativity did not confound or modify this association.

T1  - Interventions to increase influenza vaccination rates in children with high-risk conditions--a systematic review.

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Influenza is a common cause of morbidity and mortality, especially among the elderly and those with certain chronic diseases. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for individuals in at-risk groups, but rates of vaccination are particularly low in children with high-risk conditions (HRCs)., OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of studies that have examined interventions aimed at improving influenza vaccination in children with HRCs., METHODS: Two databases - PubMed and SCOPUS - were searched (with no time or language restrictions) using a combination of keywords - Influenza AND vaccination OR immunization OR children AND asthma OR malignancy OR high-risk AND reminder. Duplicates were removed, and abstracts of relevant articles were screened using specific inclusion/exclusion criteria. Thirteen articles were selected, and five additional studies were identified following a review of the reference lists of the initial thirteen articles, bringing the total number to eighteen., RESULTS: Most studies were conducted in the United States. Among the 18 studies, there was one systematic review of a specific intervention in asthmatic children, seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs), six before-and-after studies, one non-randomized controlled trial, one retrospective cohort study, one quasi-experimental post-test study, and one letter to editors. Interventions reported include multi-component strategies, letter reminders, telephone recall, letters plus telephone calls, an asthma education tool and year-round scheduling for influenza vaccination, amongst others., CONCLUSION: There is good evidence that reminder letters will improve influenza vaccination uptake in children with HRCs, but the evidence that telephone recall or a combination of letter reminder and telephone recall will improve uptake is weak. It is not known if multiple reminder letters are more effective than single letters or if multi-component strategies are more effective than single or dual component strategies. There is a need for further research of these interventions, possibly outside the United States. Crown Copyright © 2014. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the differential impact of combinations of parental smoking behavior (indoor or outdoor smoking, or not smoking) on preventing childhood asthma. Our objective was to examine the association between parental smoking behavior and children's asthma., METHODS: A nationally representative population-based birth cohort of 40,580 babies, aged 0.5 years in 2001 (response rate, 87.8%), was studied to estimate adjusted odds ratios of combinations of maternal and paternal indoor or outdoor smoking at home for physician visits and hospitalization for childhood asthma up to 8-years-old, and population attributable fractions., RESULTS: Odds of hospitalization for asthma among children whose father alone smokes indoors at home did not largely increase (up to 20%). However, if the mother also smokes indoors at home, the odds strongly increased. After adjusting for demographic, perinatal and socioeconomic factors, the increase in odds for children whose father and mother both smoke indoors compared to children with non-smoking parents was 54% (95% confidence interval: 21-96%), 43% (8-90%) and 72% (22-143%) for children aged 0.5<-2.5, 2.5<-4.5 and 4.5<-8 years-old, respectively. The odds ratios of smoking outdoors did not largely differ from those of smoking indoors. Our estimation of population attributable fractions revealed that if all parents in Japan quit smoking, hospitalization of children for asthma could be reduced by 8.3% (2.2-14.3%), 9.3% (0.9-17.6%) and 18.2% (7.7-28.8%), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Parental indoor smoking at home increased and exacerbated children's asthma. Smoking at home, whether it is indoors or outdoors, may increase the risks for asthma attacks of their children. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Previous observational studies have claimed that birth weight and childhood wheezing disorders are associated although the results remained inconsistent. One systematic review and two systematic reviews that included meta-analyses reported inconsistent results. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate this., METHODS: An online search of published papers linking childhood asthma and wheezing disorders with birth weight up to February 2014 was carried out using EMBASE and Medline medical research databases. Summary ORs were estimated using random-effects models. Subgroup meta-analyses were performed to assess the robustness of risk associations and between-study heterogeneity., RESULTS: A total of 37 studies comprising 1,71, 737 participants were included in our meta-analysis. The unadjusted summary ORs for risk of childhood wheezing disorders associated with low birth weight (<2.5 kg) were 1.60 (95% CI 1.39 to 1.85, p<0.001) and 1.37 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.79, p=0.02) when compared with >=2.5 and 2.5-4.0 kg birthweight groups, respectively. The overall summary OR for high birth weight (>4 kg) as compared to the 2.5-4.0 kg birthweight group was 1.02 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.04, p=0.13). There was substantial heterogeneity in the unadjusted low birth weight risk estimates which was not accounted for by predefined study characteristics. There was no significant heterogeneity in the high birth weight risk estimates. There was some evidence of funnel plot asymmetry and small study effects in the low birth weight (2.5 vs >=2.5 kg and <2.5 vs 2.5-4 kg) OR estimates., CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that low birth (<2.5 kg) is an independent risk factor for wheezing disorders during childhood and adolescence although there was substantial heterogeneity among the risk estimates. However, we found no significant association of high birth weight with wheezing disorders. Copyright Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

N2  - Household crowding can place young children at risk for respiratory infections which subsequently provoke asthma symptoms. However, crowding might also protect against asthma, in accordance with the hygiene hypothesis. We tested if parent-infant bed-sharing, an important dimension of household crowding, increases or decreases the risk for asthma. In a population-based prospective cohort (N = 6160) we assessed bed-sharing at 2 and 24 months; wheezing between 1 and 6 years of age; and asthma at 6 years of age. Generalised estimating equation models were used to assess repeated measures of wheezing and asthma. We found no association between bed-sharing in early infancy and wheezing or diagnosis of asthma. By contrast, we found a positive association between bed-sharing in toddlerhood and both wheezing (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.15-1.74) and asthma (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.03-2.38). Wheezing was not associated with bed-sharing when using cross-lagged modelling. This study suggests that bed-sharing in toddlerhood is associated with an increased risk of asthma at later ages, and not vice versa. Further studies are needed to explore the underlying causal mechanisms. Copyright ©ERS 2015.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder mostly affecting young children. Although several studies aimed to identify the risk factors for asthma in AD children, many aspects still need to be clarified. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible risk factors for asthma at school age in 99 children with early-onset and IgE-mediated AD., METHODS: All children performed clinical evaluation and total and specific IgE assay for a panel of inhalant and food allergens at two different times (t1 and t2) during preschool, and asthma diagnosis was assessed at one follow-up visit (t3) at school age., RESULTS: At t3, 39% of children had developed asthma. Of the variables compared, the sensitization to more than one class of inhalant allergens at t2 (mean age = 30 months) was associated with asthma, with grass (OR = 3.24, p = 0.020) and cat sensitization (OR = 2.74, p = 0.043) as independent risk factors., CONCLUSIONS: The sensitization pattern of a child with early-onset AD, also within the first 2-3 years of life, can reflect his risk to develop asthma. Therefore, testing these children for the more common allergens during this time frame should be recommended to predict the evolution of atopic diseases.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Cross-sectional gender differences in wheeze are well documented, but few studies have examined the gender-specific risk factors for wheeze longitudinally. This study aims to identify gender- and age-specific risk factors for wheeze from birth through adolescence., METHODS: The incidence of wheeze was ascertained every 6 months through age 14 years in a birth cohort consisting of 499 children with a parental history of atopy. Gender- and age-specific risk factors were identified through generalized estimating equations., RESULTS: A total of 454 (91.0%) and 351 (70.3%) children were followed past age 7 and 13 years, respectively. Maternal asthma was a risk factor for wheeze in girls (OR = 2.05, 95% CI 1.44-2.91, P < 0.0001) and boys (OR = 1.79, 1.29-2.48, P = 0.0004) and had a similar effect on wheeze throughout the ages. Paternal asthma (OR = 1.83, 1.38-2.57, P = 0.0005) and infant bronchiolitis (OR = 2.15, 1.47-3.14, P < 0.0001) were risk factors for boys only, with similar effects throughout the ages., CONCLUSION: Using a prospective cohort, we identified gender- and age-specific risk factors for wheeze. The identification of gender-specific early life risk factors may allow for timely interventions and a more personalized approach to the treatment of asthma. Copyright © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize factors associated with readmission for acute asthma exacerbation, particularly around caregiver asthma knowledge, beliefs, and reported adherence to prescribed medication regimens., STUDY DESIGN: We enrolled 601 children (aged 1-16 years) who had been hospitalized for asthma. Caregivers completed a face-to-face survey regarding their asthma knowledge, beliefs, and medication adherence. Caregivers also reported demographic data, child's asthma severity, exposure to triggers, access to primary care, and financial strains. We prospectively identified asthma readmission events via billing data over a 1-year minimum follow-up period. We examined time to readmission with Cox proportional hazards., RESULTS: The study cohort's median age was 5 years, 53% were African American, and 57% were covered by Medicaid. At 1 year, 22% had been readmitted for asthma. In the multivariate analysis, a caregiver's demonstration of increased asthma knowledge was associated with increased readmission risk. In addition, children whose caregivers reported less-than-perfect adherence to daily medication regimens had increased readmission risk. Likewise, having previously been admitted for asthma, decreased medical home access, and black race were associated with increased readmission risk., CONCLUSION: In a multifactorial assessment of risk factors for asthma readmission, greater asthma knowledge and decreased medication adherence were associated with readmission. Inpatient efforts to prevent readmission might best target medication adherence rather than continuing to primarily provide asthma education. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Early life risk factors are previously described for childhood asthma, but less is known related to asthma in adolescence. We aimed to investigate early risk factors (before 2 years) for pubertal asthma and secondarily for pubertal asthma phenotypes based upon allergic comorbidities., METHODS: Based on data from 550 adolescents in the prospective birth cohort 'Environment and Childhood Asthma' study, subjects were categorized by recurrent bronchial obstruction (rBO) 0-2 years, asthma 2-10 years, and pubertal asthma from 10 to 16 years including incident asthma in puberty and asthma in remission from 10 to 16 years or as never rBO/asthma 0-16 years. Asthma in puberty was further classified based on the comorbidities atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis (AR) from 10 to 16 years. Twenty-three common asthma risk factors identified by 2 years of age, including frequency and persistence of bronchial obstruction (severity score), were analysed by weighted logistic regression for each phenotype., RESULTS: In adjusted models, the risk of pubertal asthma increased significantly with higher severity score, parental rhinitis, being the firstborn child, and familial stress around birth. Pubertal asthma in remission was significantly associated with severity score and number of lower respiratory tract infections and inversely associated with breastfeeding beyond 4 months. Pubertal incident asthma was more common among firstborn children. All asthma phenotypes with allergic diseases were significantly associated with severity score, whereas familial perinatal stress increased the risk of asthma only. Asthma combined with AR was associated with parental asthma and being firstborn, whereas the risk of asthma with both atopic dermatitis and AR increased with higher paternal education, atopic dermatitis, being firstborn, and familial perinatal stress., CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Important early risk factors for pubertal asthma were early airways obstruction, parental rhinitis, being the firstborn child, and perinatal familial stress.

N2  - UNLABELLED: Abstract Objective: The prevalence of asthma in children age 0-14 years in Fuzhou, a city in Southeast China, was 1.57% in 1990 and 3.28% in 2000. The aim of this study was to investigate the asthma prevalence and risk factors in children in the same city in 2010., METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study with a two-stage, clustered, stratified random sample design. Parents of 12235 children 0-14 years of age in Fuzhou were surveyed using a questionnaire. Children with history and/or symptoms of asthma were then interviewed by pediatricians in a nearby clinic to confirm the diagnosis of asthma, and a second questionnaire listing reported risk factors of asthma was completed by the parents in the clinic., RESULTS: About 11738 questionnaires were completed with a response rate of 95.9%. Among the responders, 648 children had history and/or symptoms of asthma but only 485 (4.13%) were confirmed with asthma. The prevalence was 1.83%, 7.64% and 6.27% in the age groups of 0-1 years, 3-4 years and 13-14 years, respectively. The most significant (binary logistic regression test) factors associated with asthma were presence of atopic or allergic diseases (OR=21.5, 95% CI: 12-38.5), family history of allergy or asthma (OR=29.4, 95% CI: 12.6-68.6), use of at least one course of antibiotics in the first year of life (OR=7.61, 95% CI: 3.4-17.06), supplementary protein feedings before 6 months (OR=1.90, 95% CI: 1.23-2.95). Natural ventilation at home (versus frequent use of air-conditioning) appeared to be a protective factor (OR = 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3-0.8)., CONCLUSION: The prevalence of asthma in childhood has increased significantly during the past 20 years in Fuzhou.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Asthma Predictive Index (API) has been used for predicting asthma in prospective or cross-sectional studies, not for a retrospective study. We aim to develop and validate API for a retrospective study., METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study based on a convenience sample of children who participated in a previous retrospective cohort study. API was operationalized by two or more wheezing episodes in a year during the first 3 years of life PLUS one of the major or two of the minor criteria of the original API. We assessed validity of retrospective API against Predetermined Asthma Criteria (PAC) which has been extensively used in clinical studies for asthma. We assessed criterion validity by measuring kappa and agreement rate between API and PAC and construct validity by determining associations of API with known risk factors for asthma., RESULTS: Of the eligible 105 children, 55 (52.4%) were male, 90 (85.7%) Caucasians, and the mean age (+/-SD) was 5.8 years (+/-1.5). API criteria was met by 15 (14.3%), compared to 33 (31.4%) by PAC, respectively. The agreement rate and kappa between API and definite asthma of PAC were 89.5% and 0.66 (p < 0.01). Atopic conditions, lower parental education, no history of breastfeeding and family history of asthma were significantly associated with risk of asthma by API., CONCLUSIONS: Application of API to a retrospective study for ascertaining asthma status is suitable. Our study findings need to be replicated by future studies with a larger sample size.

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - Childhood asthma prevalence worldwide has been increasing markedly over several decades. Various theories have been proposed to account for this alarming trend. The disease has a broad spectrum of potential determinants ranging from genetics to lifestyle and environmental factors. Epidemiological observations have demonstrated that several important lifestyle and environmental factors including obesity, urban living, dietary patterns such as food low in antioxidants and fast food, non-breastfeeding, gut flora imbalance, cigarette smoking, air pollution, and viral infection are associated with asthma exacerbations in children. However, only environmental tobacco smoke has been associated with the development of asthma. Despite epidemiological studies indicating that many other factors are probably associated with the development of asthma, the relationships are not considered causal due to the inadequate evidence and inconsistent results from recent studies. This may highlight that sufficient data and exact mechanisms of causality are still in need of further study. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Monitoring the level of asthma control is important in determining the effectiveness of current treatment which may decrease the frequency and intensity of symptoms and functional limitations. Uncontrolled asthma has been associated with decreased quality of life and increased health care use. The objectives of this study were to assess the level of asthma control and identify related risk factors among persons with current asthma., METHODS: Using the 2006 to 2010 BRFSS child and adult Asthma Call-back Survey, asthma control was classified as well-controlled or uncontrolled (not-well-controlled or very-poorly-controlled) using three impairment measures: daytime symptoms, night-time symptoms, and taking short-acting beta2-agonists for symptom control. Multivariate logistic regression identified predictors of asthma control., RESULTS: Fifty percent of adults and 38.4% of children with current asthma had uncontrolled asthma. About 63% of children and 53% of adults with uncontrolled asthma were on long-term asthma control medications. Among children, uncontrolled asthma was significantly associated with being younger than 5 years, having annual household income <$15,000, and reporting cost as barriers to medical care. Among adults, it was significantly associated with being 45 years or older, having annual household income of <$25,000, being "other" race, having less than a 4-year college degree, being a current or former smoker, reporting cost as barriers, being obese, and having chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or depression., CONCLUSION: Identifying and targeting modifiable predictors of uncontrolled asthma (low educational attainment, low income, cigarette smoking, and co-morbid conditions including obesity and depression) could improve asthma control.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Rhinitis affects many young adults and often shows comorbidity with asthma., OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that young adult rhinitis, like asthma, exhibits clinical heterogeneity identifiable by means of cluster analysis., METHODS: Participants in the Isle of Wight birth cohort (n = 1456) were assessed at 1, 2, 4, 10, and 18 years of age. Cluster analysis was performed on those with rhinitis at age 18 years (n = 468) by using 13 variables defining clinical characteristics., RESULTS: Four clusters were identified. Patients in cluster 1 (n = 128 [27.4%]; ie, moderate childhood-onset rhinitis) had high atopy and eczema prevalence and high total IgE levels but low asthma prevalence. They showed the best lung function at 18 years of age, with normal fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (Feno), low bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), and low bronchodilator reversibility (BDR) but high rhinitis symptoms and treatment. Patients in cluster 2 (n = 199 [42.5%]; ie, mild-adolescence-onset female rhinitis) had the lowest prevalence of comorbid atopy, asthma, and eczema. They had normal lung function and low BHR, BDR, Feno values, and total IgE levels plus low rhinitis symptoms, severity, and treatment. Patients in cluster 3 (n = 59 [12.6%]; ie, severe earliest-onset rhinitis with asthma) had the youngest rhinitis onset plus the highest comorbid asthma (of simultaneous onset) and atopy. They showed the most obstructed lung function with high BHR, BDR, and Feno values plus high rhinitis symptoms, severity, and treatment. Patient 4 in cluster 4 (n = 82 [17.5%]; ie, moderate childhood-onset male rhinitis with asthma) had high atopy, intermediate asthma, and low eczema. They had impaired lung function with high Feno values and total IgE levels but intermediate BHR and BDR. They had moderate rhinitis symptoms., CONCLUSION: Clinically distinctive adolescent rhinitis clusters are apparent with varying sex and asthma associations plus differing rhinitis severity and treatment needs.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Studies have shown an inverse association of pet ownership with allergy but inconclusive findings for asthma., OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether pet ownership during pregnancy and childhood was associated with asthma and atopy at the age of 7 in a UK population-based birth cohort., METHODS: Data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) were used to investigate associations of pet ownership at six time points from pregnancy to the age of 7 with asthma, atopy (grass, house dust mite, and cat skin prick test) and atopic vs. non-atopic asthma at the age of 7 using logistic regression models adjusted for child's sex, maternal history of asthma/atopy, maternal smoking during pregnancy, and family adversity., RESULTS: A total of 3768 children had complete data on pet ownership, asthma, and atopy. Compared with non-ownership, continuous ownership of any pet (before and after the age of 3) was associated with 52% lower odds of atopic asthma [odds ratio (OR) 0.48, 95% CI 0.34-0.68]. Pet ownership tended to be associated with increased risk of non-atopic asthma, particularly rabbits (OR 1.61, 1.04-2.51) and rodents (OR 1.86, 1.15-3.01), comparing continuous vs. non-ownership. Pet ownership was consistently associated with lower odds of sensitization to grass, house dust mite, and cat allergens, but rodent ownership was associated with higher odds of sensitization to rodent allergen. Differential effects of pet ownership on atopic vs. non-atopic asthma were evident for all pet types., CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Pet ownership during pregnancy and childhood in this birth cohort was consistently associated with a reduced risk of aeroallergen sensitization and atopic asthma at the age of 7, but tended to be associated (particularly for rabbits and rodents) with an increased risk of non-atopic asthma. The opposing effects on atopy vs. non-atopic asthma might be considered by parents when they are deciding whether to acquire a pet. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Maternal obesity has been linked to offspring asthma; however, other allergy-related diseases, as well as the association beyond early school age, are largely unstudied., OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations between maternal body mass index (BMI) in pregnancy and offspring asthma, rhinitis, eczema and sensitization up to 16 years of age., METHODS: A total of 3294 children from the Swedish birth cohort BAMSE were included in the analyses. Maternal BMI was assessed around week 10 in pregnancy. Information on asthma, rhinitis, eczema, lifestyle factors and environmental exposures was obtained by parental questionnaires at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 years. Sensitization was defined from IgE levels of inhalant allergens at 4, 8 and 16 years in a subsample of 2850 children. Generalized estimated equation models were used to analyse the associations between maternal BMI and the outcomes at 1-16 years., RESULTS: Maternal BMI was positively associated with overall risk of asthma up to age of 16 years (adj OR per 5 kg/m(2) increase: 1.23; 95% CI 1.07-1.40 for prevalent asthma) excluding underweight mothers. In contrast, no significant associations were found for rhinitis, eczema or sensitization. The association with asthma was restricted to obese, rather than overweight mothers, but was attenuated when adjusting for overweight in the offspring. A causal inference test at 16 years further indicated that the child's own overweight is a mediator in the suggested association between maternal BMI and offspring asthma at 16 years., CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Maternal BMI is associated with an increased risk of asthma, but not rhinitis, eczema or sensitization; however, overweight in the offspring seems to have a mediating role. Prevention strategies of maternal pre-pregnancy and childhood obesity might be important to reduce the prevalence of childhood asthma. Copyright 2014 The Authors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Acute airway infections, including bronchiolitis, are common causes of early childhood hospitalization. The development of later asthma may be related to early airway infections in young children. This study is to investigate the relationship between hospitalized airway infections (HAI) in young children (< 3 years old) and later childhood asthma., METHODS: Hospitalized children (< 3 years old) with bronchiolitis or other acute airway infections (other HAI group) from 1997-2000 were retrieved from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan, and compared to age- and gender-matched subjects with regards to asthma until 10 years of age; and potential comorbidities and medical care conditions., RESULTS: In total, 3,264 children (1,981 with bronchiolitis; 1,283 with other HAIs) were compared to 18,527 controls. The incidence of childhood asthma was higher in the study (16.2%) than the control (11.7%) group, and most cases were diagnosed between 3-5 years old. The hazard ratios were 1.583 (95% CI: 1.414-1.772) and 1.226 (95% CI: 1.053-1.428) for the bronchiolitis and other HAI subgroups, respectively, compared to the control group, and 1.228 (95% CI: 1.075-1.542) in the bronchiolitis subgroup compared to the other HAIs subgroup. A significantly higher odds ratio (1.973, 95% CI: 1.193-3.263) for the children with congenital heart disease (CHD) in the bronchiolitis subgroup was found at an age of 3-5 years compared to the control group., CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Young children (< 3 years old) hospitalized due to acute HAIs are at a higher risk of developing childhood asthma at age 3 to 10 years. The parents of children with HAIs at age 0 to 2 years should be informed for the higher risk of developing childhood asthma, especially in children with CHD and bronchiolitis.

N2  - Asthma is a common chronic multifactorial disease that affects >300 million people worldwide. Outdoor and indoor pollution exposure has been associated with respiratory health effects in adults and children. Smoking still represents a huge public health problem and millions of children suffer the detrimental effects of passive smoke exposure. This study was designed to review the current evidences on exposure to passive smoke as a risk factor for asthma onset in childhood. A review of the most recent studies on this topic was undertaken to provide evidence about the magnitude of the effect of passive smoking on the risk of incidence of asthma in children. The effects of passive smoking are different depending on individual and environmental factors. Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is one of the most important indoor air pollutants and can interact with other air pollutants in eliciting respiratory outcomes during childhood. The increased risk of respiratory outcomes in children exposed to prenatal and early postnatal passive smoke might be caused by an adverse effect on both the immune system and the structural and functional development of the lung; this may explain the subsequent increased risk of incident asthma. The magnitude of the exposure is quite difficult to precisely quantify because it is significantly influenced by the child's daily activities. Because exposure to ETS is a likely cause for asthma onset in childhood, there is a strong need to prevent infants and children from breathing air contaminated with tobacco smoke.

N2  - Chronic obstructive lung diseases, like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, have high prevalences and are a major public health concern. Chronic obstructive lung diseases have at least part of their origins in early life. Exposure to an adverse environment during critical periods in early life might lead to permanent developmental adaptations which results in impaired lung growth with smaller airways and lower lung volume, altered immunological responses and related inflammation, and subsequently to increased risks of chronic obstructive lung diseases throughout the life course. Various pathways leading from early life factors to respiratory health outcomes in later life have been studied, including fetal and early infant growth patterns, preterm birth, maternal obesity, diet and smoking, children's diet, allergen exposure and respiratory tract infections, and genetic susceptibility. Data on potential adverse factors in the embryonic and preconception period and respiratory health outcomes are scarce. Also, the underlying mechanisms how specific adverse exposures in the fetal and early postnatal period lead to chronic obstructive lung diseases in later life are not yet fully understood. Current studies suggest that interactions between early environmental exposures and genetic factors such as changes in DNA-methylation and RNA expression patterns may explain the early development of chronic obstructive lung diseases. New well-designed epidemiological studies are needed to identify specific critical periods and to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the development of chronic obstructive lung disease throughout the life course.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To study the epidemiological features, treatment status, and risk factors for asthma in children in Zhengzhou, China., METHODS: Questionnaires for primary screening were issued using the method of multi-stage stratified sampling. Suspected asthmatic children were given a second questionnaire, physical examination, medical history review, and auxiliary examination to confirm the diagnosis. Age- and sex-matched non-asthmatic children were randomly recruited to the control group., RESULTS: The number of valid questionnaires was 10 616 (5 444 males and 5 172 females). There were 308 confirmed asthma cases and the overall prevalence was 2.90%. The prevalence in boys was higher than that in girls (3.4% vs 2.4%). The prevalence in children under 3 years of age was 10.2%, which was higher than that in other age groups. The top three triggers for asthma attack in children were respiratory infection (94.2%), weather changes (89.0%), and exercise (35.1%). The most common asthma attack was moderate (71.8%), followed by mild (22.7%). Inhaled corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids, and antibiotics were applied to 94.8% (292 cases), 74.7% (230 cases), and 90.9% (280 cases) of all patients, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated the following major risk factors for asthma: history of allergic rhinitis (OR=150.285, 95% CI: 31.934-707.264), history of eczema (OR=10.600, 95% CI: 1.054-106.624), history of atopic dermatitis (OR=31.368, 95% CI: 3.339-294.683), food allergies (OR=27.373, 95% CI: 2.670-280.621), method of birth (OR=2.853, 95% CI: 1.311-6.208), age of first antibiotic use (OR=0.384, 95% CI: 0.172-0.857), frequency of antibiotic use within 1 year of age (OR=9.940, 95% CI: 6.246-15.820), use of wall decorating materials (OR=2.108, 95% CI: 1.464-3.036), and use of heat supply in winter (OR=6.046, 95% CI: 1.034-35.362)., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of childhood asthma is associated with age and gender in Zhengzhou. Most asthma attacks are moderate, often triggered by respiratory infection. Treatment of asthma has been standardized, but still needs further improvement. History of allergic rhinitis, eczema, atopic dermatitis and food allergies, cesarean delivery, frequent use of antibiotics within 1 year of age, use of decorating materials on the wall, and use of heating in winter may increase risk for asthma, and use of antibiotics in older age is a protective factor against asthma in children.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Adolescence is a period of change, which coincides with disease remission in a significant proportion of subjects with childhood asthma. There is incomplete understanding of the changing characteristics underlying different adolescent asthma transitions. We undertook pathophysiological characterization of transitional adolescent asthma phenotypes in a longitudinal birth cohort., METHODS: The Isle of Wight Birth Cohort (N = 1456) was reviewed at 1, 2, 4, 10 and 18-years. Characterization included questionnaires, skin tests, spirometry, exhaled nitric oxide, bronchial challenge and (in a subset of 100 at 18-years) induced sputum. Asthma groups were "never asthma" (no asthma since birth), "persistent asthma" (asthma at age 10 and 18), "remission asthma" (asthma at age 10 but not at 18) and "adolescent-onset asthma" (asthma at age 18 but not at age 10)., RESULTS: Participants whose asthma remitted during adolescence had lower bronchial reactivity (odds ratio (OR) 0.30; CI 0.10 -0.90; p = 0.03) at age 10 plus greater improvement in lung function (forced expiratory flow 25-75% gain: 1.7 L; 1.0-2.9; p = 0.04) compared to persistent asthma by age 18. Male sex (0.3; 0.1-0.7; p < 0.01) and lower acetaminophen use (0.4; 0.2-0.8; p < 0.01) independently favoured asthma remission, when compared to persistent asthma. Asthma remission had a lower total sputum cell count compared to never asthma (31.5 [25-75 centiles] 12.9-40.4) vs. 47.0 (19.5-181.3); p = 0.03). Sputum examination in adolescent-onset asthma showed eosinophilic airway inflammation (3.0%, 0.7-6.6), not seen in persistent asthma (1.0%, 0-3.9), while remission group had the lowest sputum eosinophil count (0.3%, 0-1.4) and lowest eosinophils/neutrophils ratio of 0.0 (Interquartile range: 0.1)., CONCLUSION: Asthma remission during adolescence is associated with lower initial BHR and greater gain in small airways function, while adolescent-onset asthma is primarily eosinophilic.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The Asthma Predictive Index (API) and persistent wheezing phenotypes are associated with childhood asthma, but previous studies have not assessed their ability to predict objectively confirmed asthma., OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the University of Cincinnati API Index (ucAPI) and/or persistent wheezing at age 3 can accurately predict objectively confirmed asthma at age 7., METHODS: Data from the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study, a high-risk prospective birth cohort, was used. Asthma was defined as parent-reported or physician-diagnosed asthma objectively confirmed by a change in FEV1 of >=12% after bronchodilator or a positive methacholine challenge (PC20 <= 4 mg/mL); or as prior treatment with daily asthma controller medication(s). Multivariate logistic regression was used to investigate the relationship between confirmed asthma at age 7 and a positive ucAPI (adapted and modified from prior published API definitions) and persistent wheezing at age 3., RESULTS: At age 7, 103 of 589 children (17.5%) satisfied the criteria for asthma. Confirmed asthma at age 7 was significantly associated with a positive ucAPI (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 13.3 [95% CI, 7.0-25.2]; P < .01) and the persistent wheezing phenotype (aOR 9.8 [95% CI, 4.9-19.5]; P < .01) at age 3. Allergic persistent wheezing was associated with a significantly higher risk of asthma (aOR 10.4 [95% CI, 4.1-26.0]; P < .01) than nonallergic persistent wheezing (aOR 5.4 [95% CI, 2.04-14.06]; P < .01)., CONCLUSION: Both a positive ucAPI and persistent wheeze at age 3 were associated with objectively confirmed asthma at age 7; however, the highest risk was associated with ucAPI. These results demonstrate the ucAPI as a clinically useful tool for predicting future asthma in school-age children. Copyright © 2014 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Family history of asthma and other allergic diseases have been linked to the risk of childhood asthma previously, but little is known about their effect on the age-of-onset and persistency of asthma until young adulthood., METHODS: We assessed the effect of the family history of asthma and allergic diseases on persistent vs. transient, and early- vs. late-onset persistent asthma in The Espoo Cohort Study 1991-2011, a population-based cohort study of 1623 subjects (follow-up rate 63.2%). The determinants were any family history (any parent or sibling); maternal; paternal; siblings only; parents only; and both siblings and parents. Analyses were conducted separately for asthma and allergic diseases while taking the other disease into account as a confounding factor. The outcomes were persistent, transient, early-onset persistent (<13 years) and late-onset persistent asthma. Adjusted risk ratios (RR) were calculated applying Poisson regression. Q-statistics were used to assess heterogeneity between RRs., RESULTS: Family history was associated with the different subtypes but the magnitude of effect varied quantitatively. Any family history of asthma was a stronger determinant of persistent (adjusted RR = 2.82, 95% CI 1.99-4.00) than transient asthma (1.65, 1.03-2.65) (heterogeneity: P = 0.07) and on early-onset than late-onset persistent asthma. Also any family history of allergic diseases was a stronger determinant of persistent and early-onset asthma. The impact of paternal asthma continued to young adulthood (early-onset: 3.33, 1.57-7.06 vs. late-onset 2.04, 0.75-5.52) while the influence of maternal asthma decreased with age (Early-onset 3.94, 2.11-7.36 vs. Late-onset 0.88, 0.28-2.81). Paternal allergic diseases did not follow the pattern of paternal asthma, since they showed no association with late-onset asthma. Also the effect estimates for other subtypes were lower than in other hereditary groups (persistent 1.29, 0.75-2.22 vs. transient 1.20, 0.67-2.15 and early-onset 1.86, 0.95-3.64 vs. late-onset 0.64, 0.22-1.80)., CONCLUSIONS: Family history of asthma and allergic diseases are strong determinants of asthma, but the magnitude of effect varies according to the hereditary group so that some subtypes have a stronger hereditary component, and others may be more strongly related to environmental exposures. Our results provide useful information for assessing the prognosis of asthma based on a thorough family history.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Estimated effects of breast-feeding on childhood health vary between studies, possibly due to confounding by baseline maternal and child characteristics. Possible time-dependent confounding has received little consideration. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of such confounding., METHODS: We estimated the relationship between cumulative exclusive breast-feeding up to 6 months and wheezing, rash and body mass index (BMI) at 12 months [in the Whistler cohort (n = 494) and PROBIT (n = 11,463)], and wheezing, rash, asthma, hay fever, eczema, allergy and BMI at age 6.5 years (PROBIT). We adjusted for time-dependent confounding by weight, length, rash, respiratory illness and day care attendance using marginal structural models (MSMs)., RESULTS: Weight and day care attendance appeared potential time-dependent confounders, since these predicted breast-feeding status and were influenced by previous breast-feeding. However, adjustment for time-dependent confounders did not markedly change the estimated associations. For example, in PROBIT the adjusted increase in BMI at 12 months per 1-month increase in exclusive breast-feeding was 0.04 (95% CI -0.09 to 0.01) using logistic regression and -0.06 (95% CI -0.11 to -0.01) using MSM. In Whistler, these estimates were each -0.05 (95% CI -0.10 to 0.00)., CONCLUSIONS: In two cohort studies, there was little evidence of time-dependent confounding by weight, length, rash, respiratory illness or day care attendance of the effects of breast-feeding on early childhood health.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Asthma symptoms can interrupt daily activities, disturb sleep, and increase the risk of a child having an attention deficit or irritability, which also are symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Previous studies have shown conflicting results regarding the association between ADHD and asthma. This study investigates the possible correlation between asthma and ADHD., METHODS: We retrieved data on 221,068 pediatric patients from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database in 2005, and calculated the prevalence and risk factors of allergic diseases among ADHD patients., RESULTS: The prevalence of asthma in the ADHD group, compared with the control group, was 4.3 fold higher in the age 12 to 17 subgroup (95% CI, 1.71 to 10.6), 1.5-fold higher in males (95% CI, 1.05 to 2.03), and 1.6-fold higher for children living in urban areas (95% CI, 1.12 to 2.28). Multivariate logistic regression models showed the odds ratio of asthma for children with ADHD was 1.43 (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.95) as compared with children without ADHD., CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric ADHD was associated positively with asthma, but the underlying mechanisms require further clarification.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In western countries, late-onset asthmatics are more severe than early-onset asthmatics in clinic-based studies. However, whether asthma occurrence rates were higher in late ages than in younger ages was inconclusive. This information is essentially lacking in Asian population., METHODS: The participants were schoolchildren's parents recruited from 94 elementary and middle schools in 2004. A cross-sectional self-administered questionnaire was sent through the children to their parents to survey their respiratory health. We investigated typical asthma symptoms occurring at different ages and subsequent remission or relapse after the first asthma event. Person-years of the participants from birth to the time of survey were used as the denominator., RESULTS: Among the 25,377 participants consisting of 949,807 total person-years, 860 reported ever having asthma. Highest incidences occurred at ages 0-12 and 36-40 years. The incidence of asthma was higher in males before puberty, and higher in females after puberty, with overall incidences 1.00 and 0.77 per 1000 person-years for females and males, respectively. Participants with late-onset asthma (onset age >12 years) comprised a large portion of adult current asthmatics. More than 52% of persistence or relapse was observed in early-onset asthma (onset age <=12 years). The younger birth cohort had a more prominent later peak of asthma incidence than the older one., CONCLUSIONS: In Asian population, asthma occurrence showed a U-shape age distribution with a prominent second peak in the thirties. A high proportion of early-onset asthma relapsed and most of late-onset asthma persisted or relapsed in adulthood.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There are conflicting views as to whether childhood wheezing represents several discreet entities or a single but variable disease. Classification has centered on phenotypes often derived using subjective criteria, small samples, and/or with little data for young children. This is particularly problematic as asthmatic features appear to be entrenched by age 6/7. In this paper we aim to: identify longitudinal trajectories of wheeze and other atopic symptoms in early childhood; characterize the resulting trajectories by the socio-economic background of children; and identify potentially modifiable processes in infancy correlated with these trajectories., DATA AND METHODS: The Millennium Cohort Study is a large, representative birth cohort of British children born in 2000-2002. Our analytical sample includes 11,632 children with data on key variables (wheeze in the last year; ever hay-fever and/or eczema) reported by the main carers at age 3, 5 and 7 using a validated tool, the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood module. We employ longitudinal Latent Class Analysis, a clustering methodology which identifies classes underlying the observed population heterogeneity., RESULTS: Our model distinguished four latent trajectories: a trajectory with both low levels of wheeze and other atopic symptoms (54% of the sample); a trajectory with low levels of wheeze but high prevalence of other atopic symptoms (29%); a trajectory with high prevalence of both wheeze and other atopic symptoms (9%); and a trajectory with high levels of wheeze but low levels of other atopic symptoms (8%). These groups differed in terms of socio-economic markers and potential intervenable factors, including household damp and breastfeeding initiation., CONCLUSION: Using data-driven techniques, we derived four trajectories of asthmatic symptoms in early childhood in a large, population based sample. These groups differ in terms of their socio-economic profiles. We identified correlated intervenable pathways in infancy, including household damp and breastfeeding initiation.

N2  - Local agencies that enforce housing policies can partner with the health care system to target pediatric asthma care. These agencies retain data that can be used to pinpoint potential clusters of high asthma morbidity. We sought to assess whether the density of housing code violations in census tracts-the in-tract asthma-relevant violations (such as the presence of mold or cockroaches) divided by the number of housing units-was associated with population-level asthma morbidity and could be used to predict a hospitalized patient's risk of subsequent morbidity. We found that increased density in housing code violations was associated with population-level morbidity independent of poverty, and that the density explained 22 percent of the variation in rates of asthma-related emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Children who had been hospitalized for asthma had 1.84 greater odds of a revisit to the emergency department or a rehospitalization within twelve months if they lived in the highest quartile of housing code violation tracts, compared to those living in the lowest quartile. Integrating housing and health data could highlight at-risk areas and patients for targeted interventions. Copyright Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.

N2  - It remains unclear whether the GSTM1 genotype interacts with tobacco smoke exposure (TSE) in asthma development. This study aimed to investigate the interactions among GSTM1 genotype, gender, and prenatal TSE with regard to childhood asthma development. In a longitudinal birth cohort in Taiwan, 756 newborns completed a 6-year follow-up, and 591 children with DNA samples available for GSTM1 genotyping were included in the study, and the interactive influences of gender-GSTM1 genotyping-prenatal TSE on childhood asthma development were analyzed. Among these 591 children, 138 (23.4%) had physician-diagnosed asthma at 6 years of age, and 347 (58.7%) were null-GSTM1. Prenatal TSE significantly increased the prevalence of childhood asthma in null-GSTM1 children relative to those with positive GSTM1. Further analysis showed that prenatal TSE significantly increased the risk of childhood asthma in girls with null-GSTM1. Furthermore, among the children without prenatal TSE, girls with null-GSTM1 had a significantly lower risk of developing childhood asthma and a lower total IgE level at 6 years of age than those with positive GSTM1. This study demonstrates that the GSTM1 null genotype presents a protective effect against asthma development in girls, but the risk of asthma development increases significantly under prenatal TSE.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Despite a significant rise in asthma globally as well as in Sri Lanka, data regarding allergen sensitization patterns and other risk factors for asthma are not available. Therefore, we set out to determine the allergen sensitization patterns in children with asthma in Sri Lanka., METHODS: Skin prick testing for common indoor aeroallergens (cockroach, cat, dog, house dust mite, moulds) were carried out in 156 children with bronchial asthma at Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children., RESULTS: 49.1% of the patients were sensitized to at least one allergen and 6.4% were sensitized to three or more allergens. Of the children 37.8% tested positive to house dust mite, 23.7% to cockroach, 5.8% to indoor moulds, 12.2% to cats and 8.9% to dogs. Allergen sensitization was significantly less in children aged four years or younger than in older children (p<0.0001). A family history of asthma or allergic rhinitis (AR) was a significant risk factor (p<0.0001) for allergen sensitization (OR 10.9, 95% CI 3.9 to 30.1). Frequency of symptoms was significantly higher in those who used firewood alone compared to those who used other fuels (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 5.8)., CONCLUSIONS: Sensitization to aero-allergens was seen in a majority of children with asthma. Sensitization was significantly more in children above 4 years of age. Patients with more frequent symptoms and with AR were more likely to be sensitized to allergens.

A1  - Darrow, Lyndsey A
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Infantile acute bronchiolitis (AB) is a risk factor for the development of paediatric asthma. The associations might differ according to gestational age., METHODS: Data sets of emergency department (ED) visits (January 2002 to June 2010) and livebirth records (January 2002 to December 2004) from the state of Georgia were linked for all children who survived 1 year. Exposure was an ED visit for AB during infancy, and the outcome was an ED visit for asthma after age 5 years. The risk of asthma among children with AB (n = 11 564) was compared with the risk of asthma among children who did not have an ED visit for AB but who utilised the ED for another reason during infancy (n = 131 694). Associations were estimated using log-binomial regression models that controlled for several plausible confounders. Effect measure modification of the risk ratio by gestational age was investigated., RESULTS: Unadjusted asthma risks (per 100 children) through June 2010 were 4.5 for children with AB and 2.3 for children without AB. The adjusted risk ratio for the overall association was 1.9 [95% confidence interval 1.7, 2.1]. We did not observe effect modification of the risk ratio by gestational age., CONCLUSION: A positive association was observed between ED visits for AB and subsequent asthma ED visits after age 5; associations did not vary meaningfully by gestational age. Sensitivity analyses did not suggest large biases due to differences in ED utilisation across sociodemographic groups or loss to follow-up from residential migration.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Children may have differing susceptibility to ambient air pollution concentrations depending on various background characteristics of the children., METHODS: Using emergency department (ED) data linked with birth records from Atlanta, Georgia, we identified ED visits for asthma or wheeze among children 2 to 16 years of age from 1 January 2002 through 30 June 2010 (n = 109,758). We stratified by preterm delivery, term low birth weight, maternal race, Medicaid status, maternal education, maternal smoking, delivery method, and history of a bronchiolitis ED visit. Population-weighted daily average concentrations were calculated for 1-hour maximum carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide; 8-hour maximum ozone; and 24-hour average particulate matter less than 10 microns in diameter, particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5), and the PM2.5 components sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, elemental carbon, and organic carbon, using measurements from stationary monitors. Poisson time-series models were used to estimate rate ratios for associations between 3-day moving average pollutant concentrations and daily ED visit counts and to investigate effect-measure modification by the stratification factors., RESULTS: Associations between pollutant concentrations and asthma exacerbations were larger among children born preterm and among children born to African American mothers. Stratification by race and preterm status together suggested that both factors affected susceptibility. The largest estimated effect size (for an interquartile range increase in pollution) was observed for ozone among preterm births to African American mothers: rate ratio = 1.138 (95% confidence interval = 1.077-1.203). In contrast, the rate ratio for the ozone association among full-term births to mothers of other races was 1.025 (0.970-1.083)., CONCLUSIONS: Results support the hypothesis that children vary in their susceptibility to ambient air pollutants.

N2  - Acute bronchiolitis is a common paediatric disease of infancy. Its association with subsequent asthma development has puzzled clinicians and epidemiologists for decades. This article reviews the current state of knowledge regarding the role of acute bronchiolitis in the inception of asthma. There is little doubt that acute bronchiolitis is associated with an increased risk of recurrent wheezing throughout the primary school years although the direction of causality--i.e. whether bronchiolitis in infancy leads to asthma or it merely represents the first clinical presentation of predisposition to asthma--is uncertain. Existing evidence suggests that both host factors (e.g. prematurity, atopic predisposition) and acute viral infection characteristics (e.g. type of virus, severity) are operating in this relationship, perhaps with variable involvement in different individuals. Further clarification of these issues will help paediatricians provide evidence-based information regarding the long-term prognosis of this common disease to the families, and at the same time, it will facilitate prophylactic approaches and therapeutic strategies.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between asthma and bipolar disorder has received little research. We sought to investigate this in a large national sample. Previous studies have found mood changes after prednisone use in asthma patients, and we therefore also investigated this exposure in relation to bipolar disorder., METHODS: Cases were identified from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database with a new primary diagnosis of asthma (ICD-9:493) between 2000 and 2007. Case status required the presence of any inpatient diagnosis of asthma and/or at least one year diagnosis of asthma in outpatient service. These 46,558 cases were compared to 46,558 sex-, age-, residence- and insurance premium-matched controls and both groups were followed until the end of 2008 for first diagnosis of bipolar disorder (ICD-9 codes 296.0 to 296.16, 296.4 to 296.81 and 296.89). Competing risk adjusted Cox regression analyses were applied, adjusting for sex, age, residence, insurance premium, prednisone, hyperthyroidism, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), Charlson comorbidity index, and hospital admission days for any disorder., RESULTS: Of the 93,116 subjects, 161 were ascertained as having bipolar disorder during a mean (SD) follow-up period of 5.7 (2.2) years. Asthma was an independent risk for bipolar disorder in the fully adjusted model. Higher daily dose of prednisone was a risk factor in asthma cases., LIMITATIONS: The severity of asthma and bipolar disorder, and the route/duration of prednisone treatment were not evaluated., CONCLUSIONS: Asthma was associated with increased risk of bipolar disorder. Higher daily dose of prednisone was associated with a further increased risk. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to identify the risk factors for ARI in the Australian community., METHODS: We used a national survey of 7578 randomly selected respondents in 2008-2009 to identify the risk factors of ARI. A case was defined as a person experiencing cold or flu with one or more symptoms of: fever, chills, sore throat, runny nose, or cough in the previous four weeks., RESULTS: There were 19.8% (1505/7578) of respondents who reported ARI in the four weeks prior to the survey. Age was an independent risk factor for ARI, with the risk of acquiring ARI decreasing as age increased. Respondents reporting asthma (OR 1.4, 95%CI: 1.2-1.7) or having someone in their house attending childcare (OR 1.6, 95%CI: 1.2-2.1) were more likely to report ARI., CONCLUSIONS: It is important to identify ways of interrupting transmission of ARI amongst children. Improving identification of risk factors will enable targeted interventions for this exceedingly common syndrome.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Genetic studies have revealed that the regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) -28C/G and -403G/A polymorphisms are associated with asthma risk, but contradictory findings have also been reported. Therefore, we undertook a meta-analysis on this topic., METHODS: The PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang databases were used to identify relevant studies published in the medical literature from 1990 to March 26, 2014. Nine studies (containing 2,103 cases and 2,876 controls) investigated the -28C/G polymorphism, and 11 studies (including 2,015 cases and 1,909 controls) assessed the -403G/A polymorphism., RESULTS: The pooled results demonstrated that the -28C/G polymorphism was not associated with asthma risk in the overall populations (Caucasians, Asians, and a mixed population). However, in subgroup analysis according to age, the -28G allele was associated with an increased risk of asthma in children (odds ratio [OR] 1.27, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.57, P value for heterogeneity [P het] = 0.163, P value for the overall effect [P z] = 0.028). When we further stratified the studies performed in children on the basis of ethnicity, we found that the -28G allele was associated with an increased risk of asthma in Asian children (OR 1.28, 95 % CI 1.02-1.62, P het = 0.127, P z = 0.035), but not in Caucasian children (OR 1.20, 95 % CI 0.68-2.12, P het = 0.137, P z = 0.530). In subgroup analysis by asthma phenotype, no association between either atopic or non-atopic asthma and the -28C/G polymorphism was identified. For the -403G/A polymorphism, meta-analysis showed no association with asthma risk in the overall populations (Caucasians, Asians, and black people). In subgroup analyses by age, ethnicity, and asthma phenotype, we still did not find any association between the -403G/A polymorphism and asthma., CONCLUSION: Current findings suggest an association between the -28G allele and asthma risk in Asian children but not in Caucasian children.

N2  - RATIONALE: Risk of subsequent asthma-like symptoms after early-life lower respiratory illness (LRI) caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is increased during the first decade of childhood and diminished thereafter by adolescence., OBJECTIVES: To determine the relation of early-life RSV-LRI on adult asthma-like symptoms and its interactive role with adult smoking., METHODS: A total of 1,246 nonselected infants were enrolled at birth and prospectively followed. Virologically confirmed RSV-LRIs were assessed during the first 3 years of life. At age 22, 24, 26, and 29 years, current asthma and smoking behavior were evaluated by questionnaire. Peak flow variability was assessed at age 26 and expressed as amplitude % mean. A longitudinal analysis was used to investigate the relation of RSV-LRI and active smoking to adult outcomes., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Neither RSV-LRI nor active smoking were directly associated with increased current adult asthma or peak flow variability. However, there was a significant interaction between RSV-LRI and active smoking in relation to current asthma (P for interaction = 0.004) and peak flow variability (P for interaction = 0.04). Among subjects with early RSV-LRI, those who actively smoked were 1.7 times more likely to have current asthma (95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.3; P = 0.003) and had greater amplitude % mean (10.0% vs. 6.4%; P = 0.02) than nonsmokers. Among subjects without early RSV-LRI, there was no difference in asthma risk or peak flow variability between active smokers and nonsmokers., CONCLUSIONS: Smoking is associated with increased risk of having asthma in young adults who had RSV-LRI in early life but not among subjects without these illnesses.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the prevalence and the different risk factors for asthma in children between urban and rural areas in Fuzhou, Fujian province., METHOD: The epidemiological survey of asthma in 0-14 years old children was conducted from October 2009 to October 2010 between Fuzhou urban and rural areas in Fujian province. The investigation subjects were selected in urban and rural areas by phased stratified random cluster sampling. The 2010 third national epidemiological survey questionnaire of children with asthma was used for screening for possible patients. Diagnosis of asthma was confirmed by physical examination. The children with asthma were designated as the positive cases, while non asthmatic children who were age, gender, ethnic, and living environment matched with asthmatic patients were designated as negative control. Comparison of the prevalence of asthma in children between Fuzhou urban and rural areas was performed. The influencing factors of asthma were analyzed and screened by the regression equation model of two element Logistic regression., RESULT: Totally 12 235 questionnaires of children with asthma and allergic disease screening were issued and 11 738 questionnaire were sent back (6 221 were male and 5 517 were female). The return rate was 95.9% in urban Fuzhou; 648 children were diagnosed as asthma. The prevalence of asthma in male was 6.48% and female children was 4.44% (comparison of the prevalence of gender chi(2) = 23.267, P < 0.001) in urban areas . A total of 6 000 questionnaires of children with asthma and allergic disease screening were sent out and 5 860 were responded (male children 3 228, female children 2 632). The recovery rate was 97.7% in rural Fuzhou; 135 children with asthma was diagnosed. The prevalence of asthma in male was 2.73%and female children and was 1.79%. Adding protein supplement before 6 months (OR = 1.908, 95%CI:1.233-2.959), the use of antibiotics in the treatment of asthma (OR = 14.541, 95%CI:8.920-23.705), furniture materials (non wood) (OR = 2.432, 95%CI:1.563-3.785) were the main risk factors of children with asthma in urban. Adding protein supplement before 6 months(OR = 3.021, 95%CI:1.357-6.711), the use of antibiotics in the treatment of asthma(OR = 14.784, 95%CI:3.842-56.885), the use of coal as fuel (OR = 63.339, 95% CI: 7.993-501.943), domesticated livestock (OR = 13.659, 95% CI:1.342-139.068), the family smoking before and after birth (OR = 6.226, 95%CI:2.674-14.495) and chemical fiber pillow (OR = 3.638, 95%CI:1.241-10.666) were the main risk factors of children with asthma in rural areas., CONCLUSION: The prevalence of children with asthma in urban areas was higher than that in rural areas. The prevalence of asthma in male children was higher than in female children. Adding protein food supplement before 6 months, the use of antibiotics and non solid wood furniture material were the main risk factors in children with asthma in urban areas. Adding protein supplement before 6 months, the use of antibiotics, domesticated livestock, the use of coal as fuel and the family smoking before and after birth were the main risk factor of asthma in children in rural areas.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Children with atopic eczema in infancy often develop allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma, but the term "atopic march" has been questioned as the relations between atopic disorders seem more complicated than one condition progressing into another., OBJECTIVE: In this prospective multicenter study we followed children with eczema from infancy to the age of 10 years focusing on sensitization to allergens, severity of eczema and development of allergic airway symptoms at 4.5 and 10 years of age., METHODS: On inclusion, 123 children were examined. Hanifin-Rajka criteria and SCORAD index were used to describe the eczema. Episodes of wheezing were registered, skin prick tests and IgE tests were conducted and questionnaires were filled out. Procedures were repeated at 4.5 and 10 years of age with additional examinations for ARC and asthma., RESULTS: 94 out of 123 completed the entire study. High SCORAD points on inclusion were correlated with the risk of developing ARC, (B = 9.86, P = 0.01) and asthma, (B = 10.17, P = 0.01). For infants with eczema and wheezing at the first visit, the OR for developing asthma was 4.05(P = 0.01). ARC at 4.5 years of age resulted in an OR of 11.28(P = 0.00) for asthma development at 10 years., CONCLUSION: This study indicates that infant eczema with high SCORAD points is associated with an increased risk of asthma at 10 years of age. Children with eczema and wheezing episodes during infancy are more likely to develop asthma than are infants with eczema alone. Eczema in infancy combined with early onset of ARC seems to indicate a more severe allergic disease, which often leads to asthma development. The progression from eczema in infancy to ARC at an early age and asthma later in childhood shown in this study supports the relevance of the term "atopic march", at least in more severe allergic disease.

N2  - The increased prevalence of transitions between households may have implications for child asthma morbidity. We, therefore, sought to enumerate the prevalence of regularly spending nights sleeping away from home among children admitted to the hospital for asthma and to examine the relationship of nights away to asthma-related readmission. This was a population-based, prospective cohort of 774 children, aged 1-16 years, who were admitted with asthma or bronchodilator-responsive wheezing and enrolled in the Greater Cincinnati Asthma Risks Study. The study took place at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, an urban, academic children's hospital in the Midwest. The primary exposure was regularly spending nights away from home. Selected covariates included caregiver marital status, shift work, child's race, income, psychological distress, and running out of/not having medications on hand. The primary outcome was asthma-related readmission within 12 months. A total of 19 % were readmitted within 12 months. The 33 % of children that spent >=1 night away from home per week were significantly more likely to be readmitted than those who spent no nights away (25 % vs. 16 %, p = 0.002). Spending nights away from home [adjusted relative risk (aRR) 1.5, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.2-2.0] and lower income (aRR 2.6, 95 % CI 1.1-6.4) were the strongest independent predictors of readmission after adjusting for child age, gender, and race, and caregiver marital status, shift work, risk of psychological distress, and running out of meds. Increased awareness of the multiple settings in which children with asthma live may help shape more comprehensive approaches to asthma care.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between early-life antibiotic use and the development of wheeze and asthma has been reported in several studies but might arise as a consequence of bias rather than causal relationship. We investigated the association between antibiotic prescription and subsequent development of atopy, wheeze, and asthma exacerbations, and the relation of early life antibiotic prescription with anti-infective immunity and genetic variants on asthma susceptibility locus 17q21., METHODS: Children in a population-based birth cohort were followed from birth to age 11 years. Information on antibiotic prescription, wheeze, and asthma exacerbations was extracted from medical records, and the effect of antibiotic prescription assessed with longitudinal analyses. We assessed immune responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, taken at age 11 years, to viruses (rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus; RSV) and bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae) in children who either received at least one or no antibiotic prescriptions in infancy. Finally, we assessed the association of 17q21 polymorphisms with antibiotic prescription., FINDINGS: Of 984 families who gave consent, we extracted data for 916 children. We noted significantly higher risk of physician-confirmed wheezing after antibiotic prescription (hazard ratio [HR] 1.71, 95% CI 1.32-2.23; p<0.0001) and severe wheeze or asthma exacerbation after antibiotic prescription (HR 2.26, 95% CI 1.03-4.94; p=0.041). In children who wheezed, the hazards of exacerbations (2.09, 1.51-2.90; p<0.0001) and admissions to hospital (2.64, 1.49-4.70; p=0.0009) were significantly increased in the 2 years after the first antibiotic prescription. Children who received antibiotics in infancy had significantly lower induction of cytokines, which are important in host defence against virus infections to both RSV and rhinovirus; there were no differences in antibacterial responses. Variants in 17q21 were associated with an increased risk of early life antibiotic prescription., INTERPRETATION: The association between antibiotics and asthma might arise through a complex confounding by indication. Hidden factors that may increase the likelihood of both early life antibiotic prescription and later asthma are an increased susceptibility to viral infections consequent upon impaired antiviral immunity and genetic variants on 17q21., FUNDING: Moulton Charitable Foundation and Medical Research Council.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: A case control study was designed to explore the risk factors of asthma for city children residing for more than half a year, in China., METHODS: All physician-diagnosed asthma children enrolled in the 3(rd) nationwide survey (2010) in 43 typical cities of China were selected as the cases, and non-asthmatic children in the same survey were selected as control subjects if they were matched with the cases in age and sex. A revised questionnaire on the basis of ISAAC Phase Three Environmental Questionnaire was designed to investigate the risks of asthma among city children aged 0-14 years in China. Chi square analysis and generalized linear mixed models were performed to check the exposure difference between the cases and the controls., RESULTS: 43 out of the 44 city centers were qualified according to the results after reviewing both data from the survey and management. As a result, 26 950 subjects including 12 450 asthmatic children and 14 500 control subjects were enrolled in the case-control study. Except for the children of Han ethnicity, another 5 980 children (22.2%) of ethnic minorities and 31 children (0.1%)born in foreign countries were also included as the study subjects. After controlling for city centers as random effect, age, sex, race, problems related to allergy, family history of asthma or allergy, personal medication history of antibiotics, preterm delivery, under caesarean section, baby age for introducing protein-contained foods, environmental tobacco smoking, maternal occupation, indoor plantings, room decorations, dampness, and cooking fuel were proved to be risk factors of childhood asthma. Some differences were seen in the risks of asthma between new cases and current cases. The risk for exposure to indoor plants was different between new cases (OR = 2.09, 95%CI:1.30-3.36)and current cases (OR = 0.80, 95% CI:0.74-0.86). Risks on asthma were varied by age. Allergy, inflection, odor, and preterm delivery(OR = 1.72, 95%CI:1.42-2.08) appeared to be the key risks for asthma in children younger than 3 years. Apart from the risks, specifically for children younger than 3 years, the risks on asthma for children of 3 to 5 years would also include factors as: sex (OR = 1.18, 95%CI:1.03-1.35), low birth weight (OR = 1.69, 95%CI:1.17-2.44), and caesarean section (OR = 1.26, 95%CI:1.10-2.45). Apart from risks specifically for children younger than 6 years, age (OR = 0.97, 95%CI:0.95-0.99), race (OR = 1.61, 95%CI:1.26-2.06), and emigration (OR = 1.68, 95%CI:1.39-2.03) were proved to be associated with asthma for children aged 6-14 years., CONCLUSION: Asthma risks for city children in China would include genetic factors, allergy, infection, and other environmental factors but called for further research in the country.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the predictors of eczema severity in the US population., OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the distribution and associations of childhood eczema severity in the United States., METHODS: We analyzed the data from the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health, a prospective questionnaire-based study of a nationally representative sample of 91,642 children (range, 0-17 years)., RESULTS: The prevalence of childhood eczema was 12.97% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 12.42-13.53); 67.0% (95% CI, 64.8-69.2) had mild disease, 26.0% (95% CI, 23.9-28.1) had moderate disease, and 7.0% (95% CI, 5.8-8.3) had severe disease. There was significant statewide variation of the distribution of eczema severity (Rao-Scott chi, P = 0.004), with highest rates of severe disease in Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern states. In univariate models, eczema severity was increased with older age, African American and Hispanic race/ethnicity, lower household income, oldest child in the family, home with a single mother, lower paternal/maternal education level, maternal general health, maternal/paternal emotional health, dilapidated housing, and garbage on the streets. In multivariate survey logistic regression models using stepwise and backward selection, moderate-to-severe eczema was associated with older age, lower household income, and fair or poor maternal health but inversely associated with birthplace outside the United States., CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that environmental and/or lifestyle factors play an important role in eczema severity.

N2  - Risk factors for rhinitis and asthma in the home environment were studied by a questionnaire survey. Parents of 4530 1-8 year old children (one parent per child) from randomly selected kindergartens in Chongqing, China participated. 70.4% were females; 47.1% had rhinitis symptoms in the last three months (current rhinitis, CR); 1.6% reported a history of allergic asthma (AA); 2.7% reported a history of allergic rhinitis (AR); 16.4% were current smokers; 50.8% males and 2.4% females were current smokers. Stuffy odor, unpleasant odor, tobacco smoke odor and dry air were associated with CR (adjustment for gender, current smoking and other perceptions of odor or humidity). Associations between home environment and CR, AR, and AA were studied by multiple logistic regression analyses, adjusting for gender, current smoking and other significant home factors. Living near a main road or highway was a risk factor for both CR (OR(95%CI): 1.31(1.13,1.52)) and AR (OR(95%CI): 2.44(1.48,4.03)). Other risk factors for CR included living in rural areas (OR(95%CI): 1.43(1.10,1.85)), new furniture (OR(95%CI): 1.28(1.11,1.49)), water damage (OR(95%CI): 1.68(1.29,2.18)), cockroaches (OR(95%CI): 1.46(1.23,1.73)), and keeping pets (OR(95%CI): 1.24(1.04,1.49)). Other risk factors for AR included redecoration (OR(95%CI): 2.14(1.34,3.41)), mold spots (OR(95%CI): 2.23(1.06,4.68)), window pane condensation (OR(95%CI): 2.04(1.28,3.26)). Water damage was the only home factor associated with AA (2.56(1.34,4.86)). Frequently put bedding to sunshine was protective for CR (OR(95%CI): 0.79(0.68,0.92); cleaning every day was protective for AR (OR(95%CI): 0.40(0.22,0.71)). In conclusion, parents' CR and AR were related to a number of factors of the home environment.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Oral corticosteroids are the cornerstone of acute asthma management in the emergency department. Recent evidence has raised doubts about the efficacy of this treatment in preschool-aged children with viral-induced wheezing and in smoking adults. The aims of the study were to: (1) document the magnitude of response to oral corticosteroids in children presenting to the emergency department with moderate or severe asthma; (2) quantify potential determinants of response to corticosteroids and (3) explore the role of gene polymorphisms associated with the responsiveness to corticosteroids., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The design is a prospective cohort study of 1008 children aged 1-17 years meeting a strict definition of asthma and presenting with a clinical score of >=4 on the validated Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure. All children will receive standardised severity-specific treatment with prednisone/prednisolone and cointerventions (salbutamol with/without ipratropium bromide). Determinants, namely viral aetiology, environmental tobacco smoke and single nucleotide polymorphism, will be objectively documented. The primary efficacy endpoint is the failure of emergency department (ED) management within 72 h of the ED visit. Secondary endpoints include other measures of asthma severity and time to recovery within 7 days of the index visit. The study has 80% power for detecting a risk difference of 7.5% associated with each determinant from a baseline risk of 21%, at an alpha of 0.05., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from all participating institutions. An impaired response to systemic steroids in certain subgroups will challenge the current standard of practice and call for the immediate search for better approaches. A potential host-environment interaction will broaden our understanding of corticosteroid responsiveness in children. Documentation of similar effectiveness of corticosteroids across determinants will provide the needed reassurance regarding current treatment recommendations., RESULTS: Results will be disseminated at international conferences and manuscripts targeted at emergency physicians, paediatricians, geneticists and respirologists., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: This study is registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02013076).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Allergic sensitization and filaggrin gene (FLG) variants are important risk factors for allergic disorders; however, knowledge on their individual and interactive effects on the coexistence of eczema, asthma, and rhinitis is lacking., OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at investigating the single and combined effects of allergic sensitization and FLG variants on the development of single and multiple allergic disorders., METHODS: The Isle of Wight birth cohort (n = 1456) has been examined at 1, 2, 4, 10, and 18 years of age. Repeated measurements of eczema, asthma, rhinitis, and skin prick tests were available for all follow-ups. FLG variants were genotyped in 1150 participants. Associations of allergic sensitization and FLG variants with single and multiple allergic disorders were tested in log-binomial regression analysis., RESULTS: The prevalence of eczema-, asthma-, and rhinitis-only ranged from 5.6% to 8.5%, 4.9% to 10.2%, and 2.5% to 20.4%, respectively, during the first 18 years of life. The coexistence of allergic disorders is common, with approximately 2% of the population reporting the comorbidity of 'eczema, asthma, and rhinitis' during the study period. In repeated measurement analyses, allergic sensitization and FLG variants, when analysed separately, were associated with having single and multiple allergic disorders. Of particular significance, their combined effect increased the risk of 'eczema and asthma' (RR = 13.67, 95% CI: 7.35-25.42), 'asthma and rhinitis' (RR = 7.46, 95% CI: 5.07-10.98), and 'eczema, asthma, and rhinitis' (RR = 23.44, 95% CI: 12.27-44.78)., CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The coexistence of allergic disorders is frequent, and allergic sensitization and FLG variants jointly increased risk of allergic comorbidities, which may represent more severe and complex clinical phenotypes. The interactive effect and the elevated proportion of allergic comorbidities associated with allergic sensitization and FLG variants emphasize their joint importance in the pathogenesis of allergic disorders.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Smoke-free legislation has the potential to reduce the substantive disease burden associated with second-hand smoke exposure, particularly in children. We investigated the effect of smoke-free legislation on perinatal and child health., METHODS: We searched 14 online databases from January, 1975 to May, 2013, with no language restrictions, for published studies, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for unpublished studies. Citations and reference lists of articles of interest were screened and an international expert panel was contacted to identify additional studies. We included studies undertaken with designs approved by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care that reported associations between smoking bans in workplaces, public places, or both, and one or more predefined early-life health indicator. The primary outcomes were preterm birth, low birthweight, and hospital attendances for asthma. Effect estimates were pooled with random-effects meta-analysis. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42013003522., FINDINGS: We identified 11 eligible studies (published 2008-13), involving more than 2.5 million births and 247,168 asthma exacerbations. All studies used interrupted time-series designs. Five North American studies described local bans and six European studies described national bans. Risk of bias was high for one study, moderate for six studies, and low for four studies. Smoke-free legislation was associated with reductions in preterm birth (four studies, 1,366,862 individuals; -10.4% [95% CI -18.8 to -2.0]; p=0.016) and hospital attendances for asthma (three studies, 225,753 events: -10.1% [95% CI -15.2 to -5.0]; p=0.0001). No significant effect on low birthweight was identified (six studies, >1.9 million individuals: -1.7% [95% CI -5.1 to 1.6]; p=0.31)., INTERPRETATION: Smoke-free legislation is associated with substantial reductions in preterm births and hospital attendance for asthma. Together with the health benefits in adults, this study provides strong support for WHO recommendations to create smoke-free environments., FUNDING: Thrasher Fund, Lung Foundation Netherlands, International Paediatric Research Foundation, Maastricht University, Commonwealth Fund.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To find out the prevalence of childhood (0-14 years old) asthma in Shanghai, to investigate the clinical characteristics and risk factors of asthma, and to assess the influence of asthma on patients and their families., METHOD: From September to December in 2010, 7 districts of Shanghai were selected by clustered sampling, totally 13 500 children aged 0-14 years were included in this survey. The investigation included questionnaires to parents and field survey, according to the information from questionnaires, the prevalence of asthma and clinical characteristics were analyzed, and the risk factors of asthma were evaluated by logistic regression analysis., RESULT: Totally 13 179 questionnaires were available, the response rate was 97.62%. Among them 998 (7.57%) children were diagnosed as asthma (including 895 cases of typical asthma and 103 cases of cough variant asthma), of whom 766 (76.75%) cases had asthmatic symptoms in the past 2 years, the current two year prevalence of asthma was 5.81%. The prevalence in boys was 8.48% (598/7 054) which was much higher than that in girls (6.53%, 400/6 125, chi(2) = 17.75, P < 0.001). The children aged 3-8 years had higher prevalence (10.46%), and more than half of the children (545 cases, 54.61%) had the first onset before 3 years of age. Respiratory tract infection was the most common trigger for the development of asthma (838 cases, 84.97%). Male (OR = 0.25, 95%CI: 0.12-0.45) , genetic factors (OR = 2.65, 95%CI: 1.27-5.55) , personal history of allergic diseases (OR = 9.57, 95%CI: 4.59-19.97) , and antibiotics exposure in early life (OR = 0.61, 95%CI: 0.49-0.83) would increase the risk of asthma onset. Among asthmatic children, 463 (46.39%) cases had been treated with inhaled corticosteroids, and 740 (74.15%) cases had been treated with bronchodilator. In 501 cases of school-age children's attendance time had been influenced because of their disease; 2.51% of parents could not work normally., CONCLUSION: There has been a significantly increasing trend of asthma prevalence during the past ten years, sex, family history of allergic diseases, personal history of allergic diseases and antibiotics exposure in early life are risk factors which would influence on the asthma onset. Education on and management of asthma are essential for asthma prevention.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of asthma has increased alarmingly in the past 2 to 3 decades. Increased antibiotic use in infancy has been suggested to limit exposure to gastrointestinal microbes and to predispose to asthma in later life., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between antibiotic exposure during the first year of life and the development of asthma up to the age of 7 years., METHODS: A retrospective population-based study of a cohort of children enrolled in a nationwide employer-provided health insurance plan from January 1, 1999, through December 31, 2006, in the United States (n = 62,576). We evaluated the association between antibiotic exposure during the first year of life and subsequent development of 3 asthma phenotypes: transient wheezing (began and resolved before 3 years of age), late-onset asthma (began after 3 years of age), and persistent asthma (began before 3 years of age and persisted through 4-7 years of age)., RESULTS: Antibiotic use in the first year of life was associated with the development of transient wheezing (odds ratio [OR], 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9-2.2; P < .001) and persistent asthma (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.5-1.7; P < .001). A dose-response effect was observed. When 5 or more antibiotic courses were received, the odds of persistent asthma doubled (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.5-2.6; P < .001). There is no association between antibiotic use and late-onset asthma., CONCLUSION: Antibiotic use in the first year life is associated with an increased risk of early-onset childhood asthma that began before 3 years of age. The apparent effect has a clear dose response. Heightened caution about avoiding unnecessary use of antibiotics in infants is warranted.

T1  - The global burden of respiratory disease-impact on child health.
A1  - Zar, Heather J
A1  - Ferkol, Thomas W
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Respiratory disease is the major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, with infants and young children especially susceptible. The spectrum of disease ranges from acute infections to chronic non-communicable diseases. Five respiratory conditions dominate-acute respiratory infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, tuberculosis (TB), and lung cancer. Pneumonia remains the predominant cause of childhood mortality, causing nearly 1.3 million deaths each year, most of which are preventable. Asthma is the commonest non-communicable disease in children. Pediatric TB constitutes up to 20% of the TB caseload in high incidence countries. Environmental exposures such as tobacco smoke, indoor air pollution, and poor nutrition are common risk factors for acute and chronic respiratory diseases. Pediatric and adult respiratory disease is closely linked. Early childhood respiratory infection or environmental exposures may lead to chronic disease in adulthood. Childhood immunization can effectively reduce the incidence and severity of childhood pneumonia; childhood immunization is also effective for reducing pneumonia in the elderly. The Forum of International Respiratory Societies (FIRS), representing the major respiratory societies worldwide, has produced a global roadmap of respiratory diseases, Respiratory Disease in the World: Realities of Today-Opportunities for Tomorrow. This highlights the burden of respiratory diseases globally and contains specific recommendations for effective strategies. Greater availability and upscaled implementation of effective strategies for prevention and management of respiratory diseases is needed worldwide to improve global health and diminish the current inequities in health care worldwide.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Despite a growing interest, few pediatric asthma questionnaires assess multiple dimensions of asthma morbidity, as recommended by national asthma guidelines, or use patient-reported outcomes., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a questionnaire that measures multiple dimensions of parent-reported asthma morbidity (Direction, Bother, and Risk)., METHODS: We administered the Pediatric Asthma Control and Communication Instrument (PACCI) and assessed asthma control (PACCI Control), quality of life, and lung function among children who presented for routine asthma care. The PACCI was evaluated for discriminative validity., RESULTS: A total of 317 children participated (mean age, 8.2 years; 58% boys; 44% African American). As parent-reported PACCI Direction changed from "better" to "worse," we observed poorer asthma control (P < .001), mean Pediatric Asthma Caregiver Quality of Life Questionnaire (PACQLQ) scores (P < .001), and FEV1% (P = .025). Linear regression showed that, for each change in PACCI Direction, the mean PACQLQ score decreased by -0.6 (95% CI, -0.8 to -0.4). As parent-reported PACCI Bother changed from "not bothered" to "very bothered," we observed poorer asthma control (P < .001) and lower mean PACQLQ scores (P < .001). Linear regression showed that, for each change in PACCI Bother category, the mean PACQLQ score decreased by -1.1 (95% CI, -1.3 to -0.9). Any reported PACCI Risk event (emergency department visit, hospitalization, or use of an oral corticosteroid) was associated with poorer asthma control (P < .05) and PACQLQ scores (P < .01)., CONCLUSIONS: PACCI Direction, Bother, and Risk are valid measures of parent-reported outcomes and show good discriminative validity. The PACCI is a simple clinical tool to assess multiple dimensions of parent-reported asthma morbidity, in addition to risk and control.

N2  - RATIONALE: Developmental patterns of lung function during childhood may have major implications for our understanding of the pathogenesis of respiratory disease throughout life., OBJECTIVES: To explore longitudinal trajectories of lung function during childhood and factors associated with lung function decline., METHODS: In a population-based birth cohort, specific airway resistance (sRaw) was assessed at age 3 (n = 560), 5 (n = 829), 8 (n = 786), and 11 years (n = 644). Based on prospective data (questionnaires, skin tests, IgE), children were assigned to wheeze phenotypes (no wheezing, transient, late-onset, and persistent) and atopy phenotypes (no atopy, dust mite, non-dust mite, multiple early, and multiple late). We used longitudinal linear mixed models to determine predictors of change in sRaw over time., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Contrary to the assumption that sRaw is independent of age and sex, boys had higher sRaw than girls (mean difference, 0.080; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.049-0.111; P < 0.001) and a higher rate of increase over time. For girls, sRaw increased by 0.017 kPa  s(-1) per year (95% CI, 0.011-0.023). In boys this increase was significantly greater (P = 0.012; mean between-sex difference, 0.011 kPa  s(-1); 95% CI, 0.003-0.019). Children with persistent wheeze (but not other wheeze phenotypes) had a significantly greater rate of deterioration in sRaw over time compared with never wheezers (P = 0.009). Similarly, children with multiple early, but not other atopy phenotypes had significantly poorer lung function than those without atopy (mean difference, 0.116 kPa  s(-1); 95% CI, 0.065-0.168; P < 0.001). sRaw increased progressively with the increasing number of asthma exacerbations., CONCLUSIONS: Children with persistent wheeze, frequent asthma exacerbations, and multiple early atopy have diminished lung function throughout childhood, and are at risk of a progressive loss of lung function from age 3 to 11 years. These effects are more marked in boys.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge of factors that affect relapse will allow close monitoring of patients at risk, resulting in a decreased rate of readmission to the emergency department., OBJECTIVE: To determine risk factors associated with relapse within 7 days after treatment of asthma exacerbations in children., METHODS: This was a multicenter, prospective study of children with asthma attacks. Patients between the ages of 6 months and 17 years who met the criteria between June 2009 and September 2012 were considered., RESULTS: The study included 1177 patients (775 males [65.8%]) with a mean (SD) age of 70.72 (48.24) months. Of them, 199 (16.9%) had a relapse within 1 week after being discharged from the hospital. Factors independently associated with relapse identified by a logistic regression model for the 1,177 study visits were having taken a short-acting inhaled beta2-agonist within 6 hours before admission (odds ratio [OR], 2.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.728-3.426; P = .001), presence of retraction on physical examination (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.123-2.774; P = .01), no prescription for high-dose inhaled steroids on release (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.370-3.002; P < .001), and not being given a written instructional plan (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.080-2.226; P = .02)., CONCLUSION: Whereas having taken short-acting beta2-agonists within 6 hours before admission and the presence of retractions on physical examination increased the risk of relapse after treatment of the acute attack, being given high-dose inhaled steroids and a written instructional plan when being sent home reduced the risk.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest that birth weight is related to later risk of asthma. However, few meta-analyses have investigated these associations. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis with different classifications to further validate the relationship between birth weight and asthma., METHODS: PubMed (1990-2013), ScienceDirect (1990-2013), EMBASE(1990-2013),EBSCO (1990-2013) and Springer (1990-2013) were searched for articles. The following MeSH terms were used: "birth weight", "fetal growth retardation", "intrauterine growth restriction", "asthma", "wheezing"., RESULTS: We included 18 studies with data from a total of over 90,000 children and adults. (1) Low birth weight (<2,500g) as compared with BW>2,500g and BW=2500-4000g was associated with increased risk of asthma (Children: OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.09-1.50, P<0.05; OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.13-1.60, P<0.05, Adults: OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.12-1.39, P<0.05; OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.12-1.40, P<0.05). (2) High birth weight (>4,000g) was not associated with the risk of asthma when BW<4,000g and BW=2500-4000g were used as the reference., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that low birth weight (<2,500g) is associated with increased risk of asthma both in children and adults and may serve as a mediator between prenatal influences and later disease risk; but high birth weight (>4,000g) was not associated with increased risk of asthma.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Asthma severity is a key indicator to assess asthma care and management. Severity status may vary over time. Assessing asthma severity periodically is important for monitoring the health and well-being of people with asthma., OBJECTIVE: To assess population-based asthma severity and to identify related-risk factors among children and adults with asthma., METHODS: We used the 2006-2010 BRFSS child and adult Asthma Call-back Survey. Asthma severity was classified as intermittent or persistent. We performed multivariate logistic regression to identify related-risk factors., RESULTS: Overall, 63.8% of persons with asthma had persistent asthma. Persistent asthma was more prevalent among children aged 0-4 years (71.8%; prevalence rate ratio [PR] = 1.3). Among adults with current asthma, persistent asthma was more prevalent among those who were 45 years or older (aged 45-54: 69.4%; PR = 1.1, aged 55-64: 72.6%; PR = 1.2, and aged 65+: 77.8%; PR = 1.3); annual household incomes of <$15 000 (74.1%; PR = 1.1); and first diagnosed at age 55 years or older (first diagnosed at age 55-64: 80.4%; PR = 1.1, at age 65 + : 81.5%; PR = 1.1). The prevalence of persistent asthma was also higher among current smokers who were also exposed to secondhand smoke (SHS) (74.7%; PR = 1.1); and among those with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) (77.1%; PR = 1.2)., CONCLUSIONS: Nearly two-thirds of children and adults with asthma had persistent asthma. Identifying related-risk factors could help improve targeted interventions or strategies to reduce modifiable predictors (low income, smoking, and SHS) of increased asthma severity. Such strategies could improve asthma care and quality of life.

N2  - BACKGROUND: A setting-specific asthma prediction score for preschool children with wheezing and/or dyspnoea presenting in primary healthcare is needed since existing indices are mainly based on general populations., AIMS: To find an optimally informative yet practical set of predictors for the prediction of asthma in preschool children at high risk who present in primary healthcare., METHODS: A total of 771 Dutch preschool children at high risk of asthma were followed prospectively until the age of six years. Data on asthma symptoms and environmental conditions were obtained using validated questionnaires and specific IgE was measured. At the age of six years the presence of asthma was assessed based on asthma symptoms, medication, and bronchial hyper-responsiveness. A clinical asthma prediction score (CAPS) was developed using bootstrapped multivariable regression methods., RESULTS: In all, 438 children (56.8%) completed the study; the asthma prevalence at six years was 42.7%. Five parameters optimally predicted asthma: age, family history of asthma or allergy, wheezing-induced sleep disturbances, wheezing in the absence of common colds, and specific IgE. CAPS scores range from 0 to 11 points; scores <3 signified a negative predictive value of 78.4% while scores of >7 signified a positive predictive value of 74.3%., CONCLUSIONS: We have developed an easy-to-use CAPS for preschool children with symptoms suggesting asthma who present in primary healthcare. After suitable validation, the CAPS may assist in guiding shared decision-making to tailor the need for medical or non-medical interventions. External validation of the CAPS is needed.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence implicates early life factors in the aetiology of non-communicable diseases, including asthma/wheezing disorders. We undertook a systematic review investigating risks of asthma/wheezing disorders in children born preterm, including the increasing numbers who, as a result of advances in neonatal care, now survive very preterm birth., METHODS AND FINDINGS: Two reviewers independently searched seven online databases for contemporaneous (1 January 1995-23 September 2013) epidemiological studies investigating the association between preterm birth and asthma/wheezing disorders. Additional studies were identified through reference and citation searches, and contacting international experts. Quality appraisal was undertaken using the Effective Public Health Practice Project instrument. We pooled unadjusted and adjusted effect estimates using random-effects meta-analysis, investigated "dose-response" associations, and undertook subgroup, sensitivity, and meta-regression analyses to assess the robustness of associations. We identified 42 eligible studies from six continents. Twelve were excluded for population overlap, leaving 30 unique studies involving 1,543,639 children. Preterm birth was associated with an increased risk of wheezing disorders in unadjusted (13.7% versus 8.3%; odds ratio [OR] 1.71, 95% CI 1.57-1.87; 26 studies including 1,500,916 children) and adjusted analyses (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.29-1.65; 17 studies including 874,710 children). The risk was particularly high among children born very preterm (<32 wk gestation; unadjusted: OR 3.00, 95% CI 2.61-3.44; adjusted: OR 2.81, 95% CI 2.55-3.12). Findings were most pronounced for studies with low risk of bias and were consistent across sensitivity analyses. The estimated population-attributable risk of preterm birth for childhood wheezing disorders was >=3.1%. Key limitations related to the paucity of data from low- and middle-income countries, and risk of residual confounding., CONCLUSIONS: There is compelling evidence that preterm birth-particularly very preterm birth-increases the risk of asthma. Given the projected global increases in children surviving preterm births, research now needs to focus on understanding underlying mechanisms, and then to translate these insights into the development of preventive interventions., REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42013004965.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The lack of longitudinal data analyses from birth to adulthood is hampering long-term asthma prevention strategies., OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine early-life predictors of asthma incidence up to age 20 years in a birth cohort study by applying time-to-event analysis., METHODS: In 1990, the Multicenter Allergy Study included 1314 newborns in 5 German cities. Children were evaluated from birth to age 20 years at 19 time points. Using a Cox regression model, we examined the associations between 36 early-life factors and onset of asthma based on a doctor's diagnosis or asthma medication (primary outcome), typical asthma symptoms, or allergic asthma (including positive IgE measurements)., RESULTS: Response at 20 years was 71.6%. Two hundred eighteen subjects met the primary outcome criteria within 16,257 person years observed. Asthma incidence was lower in participants who were vaccinated (measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine/tick-borne encephalitis vaccine/BCG vaccine: adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.66 [95% CI, 0.47-0.93]). Up to age 20 years, asthma incidence was higher in subjects who had parents with allergic rhinitis (adjusted HR, 2.24 [95% CI, 1.67-3.02]), started day care early or late (before 18 months: adjusted HR, 1.79 [95% CI, 1.03-3.10]; after 3 years: adjusted HR, 1.64 [95% CI, 0.96-2.79]), had mothers who smoked during pregnancy (adjusted HR, 1.79 [95% CI, 1.20-2.67]), had poor parents (adjusted HR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.09-2.22]), and had parents with asthma (adjusted HR, 1.65 [95% CI, 1.17-2.31]). Not associated with asthma were aspects of diet and breast-feeding, pet ownership, presence of older siblings, and passive smoking., CONCLUSION: Parental asthma and nasal allergy increase asthma incidence in offspring up to adulthood. Avoiding tobacco smoke exposure during pregnancy, receiving vaccinations in early childhood, and starting day care between 1.5 and 3 years of age might prevent or delay the development of asthma.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Many women drink during pregnancy and lactation despite recommendations to abstain. In animals, alcohol exposure during pregnancy and lactation influences lung and immune development, plausibly increasing risk of asthma and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). Studies in humans are few., METHODS: In the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, we examined maternal alcohol intake during pregnancy and lactation in relation to risk of current asthma at 36 months (49,138 children), recurrent LRTIs by 36 months (39,791 children), and current asthma at 7 years (13,253 children). Mothers reported frequency and amount of alcohol intake each trimester and the first 3 months following delivery. We calculated adjusted relative risk (aRR), comparing children of drinkers to nondrinkers, using Generalized Linear Models., RESULTS: A total of 31.8% of mothers consumed alcohol during first trimester, 9.7% during second trimester, and 15.6% during third trimester. Infrequent and low-dose prenatal alcohol exposure showed a modest statistically significant inverse association with current asthma at 36 months (aRRs ~ 0.85). No association was seen with the highest alcohol intakes during the first trimester when alcohol consumption was most common. RRs of maternal alcohol intake during pregnancy with recurrent LRTIs were ~1, with sporadic differences in risk for some metrics of intake, but without any consistent pattern. For current asthma at 7 years, similar inverse associations were seen as with current asthma at 36 months but were not statistically significant. Among children breastfed throughout the first 3 months of life, maternal alcohol intake during this time was not significantly associated with any of the 3 outcomes., CONCLUSIONS: The low levels of alcohol exposure during pregnancy or lactation observed in this cohort were not associated with increased risk of asthma or recurrent LRTIs. The slight inverse associations of infrequent or low-dose prenatal alcohol exposure with asthma may not be causal. Copyright © 2014 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between breastfeeding and snoring in childhood., METHODS: In a cohort of children with a family history of asthma who were recruited antenatally we prospectively recorded data on infant feeding practices throughout the first year of life. Snoring status and witnessed sleep apnea were measured at age 8 years by parent-completed questionnaire. Associations were estimated by logistic regression with, and without, adjustment for sets of confounders designed to exclude biasing effects., RESULTS: Habitual snoring was reported in 18.8% of the sample, and witnessed apnea in 2.7%. Any breastfeeding for longer than one month was associated with a reduced risk of habitual snoring at age 8 (adjusted OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.81) and duration of breastfeeding was inversely associated with the prevalence of habitual snoring (adjusted OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.00). Any breastfeeding for longer than 1 month was associated with a lower risk of witnessed sleep apnea (adjusted OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.71). The protective associations were not mediated by BMI, current asthma, atopy or rhinitis at age 8 years., CONCLUSIONS: Breastfeeding for longer than one month decreases the risk of habitual snoring and witnessed apneas in this cohort of children with a family history of asthma. The underlying mechanism remains unclear but the finding would be consistent with a beneficial effect of the breast in the mouth on oropharyngeal development with consequent protection against upper airway dysfunction causing sleep-disordered breathing.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Low total diversity of the gut microbiota during the first year of life is associated with allergic diseases in infancy, but little is known how early microbial diversity is related to allergic disease later in school age., OBJECTIVE: To assess microbial diversity and characterize the dominant bacteria in stool during the first year of life in relation to the prevalence of different allergic diseases in school age, such as asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC) and eczema., METHODS: The microbial diversity and composition was analysed with barcoded 16S rDNA 454 pyrosequencing in stool samples at 1 week, 1 month and 12 months of age in 47 infants which were subsequently assessed for allergic disease and skin prick test reactivity at 7 years of age (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT01285830)., RESULTS: Children developing asthma (n = 8) had a lower diversity of the total microbiota than non-asthmatic children at 1 week (P = 0.04) and 1 month (P = 0.003) of age, whereas allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (n = 13), eczema (n = 12) and positive skin prick reactivity (n = 14) at 7 years of age did not associate with the gut microbiota diversity. Neither was asthma associated with the microbiota composition later in infancy (at 12 months). Children having IgE-associated eczema in infancy and subsequently developing asthma had lower microbial diversity than those that did not. There were no significant differences, however, in relative abundance of bacterial phyla and genera between children with or without allergic disease., CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Low total diversity of the gut microbiota during the first month of life was associated with asthma but not ARC in children at 7 years of age. Measures affecting microbial colonization of the infant during the first month of life may impact asthma development in childhood. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Asthma phenotyping can facilitate understanding of disease pathogenesis and potential targeted therapies., OBJECTIVE: To further characterize the distinguishing features of phenotypic groups in difficult-to-treat asthma., METHODS: Children ages 6-11 years (n = 518) and adolescents and adults ages >=12 years (n = 3612) with severe or difficult-to-treat asthma from The Epidemiology and Natural History of Asthma: Outcomes and Treatment Regimens (TENOR) study were evaluated in this post hoc cluster analysis. Analyzed variables included sex, race, atopy, age of asthma onset, smoking (adolescents and adults), passive smoke exposure (children), obesity, and aspirin sensitivity. Cluster analysis used the hierarchical clustering algorithm with the Ward minimum variance method. The results were compared among clusters by chi(2) analysis; variables with significant (P < .05) differences among clusters were considered as distinguishing feature candidates. Associations among clusters and asthma-related health outcomes were assessed in multivariable analyses by adjusting for socioeconomic status, environmental exposures, and intensity of therapy., RESULTS: Five clusters were identified in each age stratum. Sex, atopic status, and nonwhite race were distinguishing variables in both strata; passive smoke exposure was distinguishing in children and aspirin sensitivity in adolescents and adults. Clusters were not related to outcomes in children, but 2 adult and adolescent clusters distinguished by nonwhite race and aspirin sensitivity manifested poorer quality of life (P < .0001), and the aspirin-sensitive cluster experienced more frequent asthma exacerbations (P < .0001)., CONCLUSION: Distinct phenotypes appear to exist in patients with severe or difficult-to-treat asthma, which is related to outcomes in adolescents and adults but not in children. The study of the therapeutic implications of these phenotypes is warranted. Copyright © 2013 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Published by Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - RATIONALE: Clinical and epidemiologic approaches have identified two distinct sets of classifications for asthma and wheeze phenotypes., OBJECTIVES: To compare epidemiologic phenotype definitions identified by latent class analysis (LCA) with clinical phenotypes based on patient histories, diagnostic work-up, and treatment responses. To relate phenotypes to genetic and environmental determinants as well as diagnostic and treatment-related parameters., METHODS: LCA was performed in an international multicenter birth cohort based on yearly questions about current wheeze until age 6 years. Associations of wheeze classes and clinical phenotypes with asthma-related characteristics such as atopy, lung function, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide, and medication use were calculated using regression models., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: LCA identified five classes, which verified the clinically defined wheeze phenotypes with high sensitivity and specificity; the respective receiver operating characteristics curves displayed an area under the curve ranging from 84% (frequent wheeze) to 85% (asthma diagnosis) and 87% (unremitting wheeze) to 97% (recurrent unremitting wheeze). Recurrent unremitting wheeze was the most specific and unremitting wheeze at least once the most sensitive definition. The latter identified a subgroup of children with decreased lung function, increased genetic risk, and in utero smoke exposure (ODDS RATIO, 2.03; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, 1.12-3.68; P = 0.0191), but without established asthma diagnosis and treatment., CONCLUSIONS: Clinical phenotypes were well supported by LCA analysis. The hypothesis-free LCA phenotypes were a useful reference for comparing clinical phenotypes. Thereby, we identified children with clinically conspicuous but undiagnosed disease. Because of their high area under the curve values, clinical phenotypes such as (recurrent) unremitting wheeze emerged as promising alternative asthma definitions for epidemiologic studies.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Ambient air pollution has been associated with asthma-related hospital admissions and emergency department visits (hospital encounters). We hypothesized that higher individual exposure to residential traffic-related air pollutants would enhance these associations., METHODS: We studied 11,390 asthma-related hospital encounters among 7492 subjects 0-18 years of age living in Orange County, California. Ambient exposures were measured at regional air monitoring stations. Seasonal average traffic-related exposures (PM2.5, ultrafine particles, NOx, and CO) were estimated near subjects' geocoded residences for 6-month warm and cool seasonal periods, using dispersion models based on local traffic within 500 m radii. Associations were tested in case-crossover conditional logistic regression models adjusted for temperature and humidity. We assessed effect modification by seasonal residential traffic-related air pollution exposures above and below median dispersion-modeled exposures. Secondary analyses considered effect modification by traffic exposures within race/ethnicity and insurance group strata., RESULTS: Asthma morbidity was positively associated with daily ambient O3 and PM2.5 in warm seasons and with CO, NOx, and PM2.5 in cool seasons. Associations with CO, NOx, and PM2.5 were stronger among subjects living at residences with above-median traffic-related exposures, especially in cool seasons. Secondary analyses showed no consistent differences in association, and 95% confidence intervals were wide, indicating a lack of precision for estimating these highly stratified associations., CONCLUSIONS: Associations of asthma with ambient air pollution were enhanced among subjects living in homes with high traffic-related air pollution. This may be because of increased susceptibility (greater asthma severity) or increased vulnerability (meteorologic amplification of local vs. correlated ambient exposures).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Prospective studies investigating the role of serum vitamin E concentrations during early life in the development of childhood allergies and asthma are limited., OBJECTIVE: To study the associations between serum vitamin E concentrations at first year of life and longitudinal development of atopy, atopic dermatitis, wheeze, and asthma up to 6 years of age., METHODS: The setting was the PASTURE study, a multicenter prospective birth cohort study in five European rural settings. Children of 1133 mothers recruited during pregnancy were followed from birth with measurement of serum vitamin E levels at year 1 and repeated assessments of serum immunoglobulin E antibodies (year 1, 4.5, 6), atopic dermatitis, wheezing symptoms, and asthma (year 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)., RESULTS: At 6 years of age, 66% and 82% of the original 1133 subjects underwent blood test for IgE and answered the questionnaire, respectively. We did not observe any statistically significant associations between serum vitamin E concentrations at year 1 and the endpoints, but borderline inverse associations between alpha tocopherol and wheezing without cold (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.19-1.09) and any wheezing symptom (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.27-1.02)., CONCLUSIONS: Serum vitamin E concentrations at year 1 were not associated with allergies or asthma by 6 years of age. While further prospective studies with repeated assessments of vitamin E during early life may clarify its putative role in the development of the diseases, it is also possible that the antioxidant hypothesis in the development of allergies and asthma does not hold.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between weight gain in the first two years of life and the occurrence of wheezing, asthma, serum IgE, skin reactivity and pulmonary function., DESIGN: Cohort study., SETTING: The metropolitan region of Salvador, Bahia, Brazil., SUBJECTS: The association was studied between 1997 and 2005 in 669 children up to 11 years of age. Data were collected on asthma and risk factors, both current factors and those present in the first years of life. Weight gain was considered fast when the Z-score was >0.67. Poisson regression was used in the multivariate statistical analysis., RESULTS: Wheezing was reported in 25.6 % of the children. Weight gain was considered fast (Z-score >0.67) in 29.6 % of the children and slow (Z-score <-0.67) in 13.9 %. Children in the slow weight gain group had 36 % fewer symptoms of asthma (prevalence ratio = 0.65; 95 % CI 0.42, 0.99)., CONCLUSIONS: Slower weight gain in the early years of life may constitute a protective factor against symptoms of asthma. The relevance of this finding for public health is not yet certain, since it is known that children with slow and fast weight gain may be more likely to develop adverse health consequences related to both these situations.

N2  - This study determined the influence of various meteorological variables and air pollutants on airway disorders in general, and asthma and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in particular, in Munich, Bavaria, during 2006 and 2007. This was achieved through an evaluation of the daily frequency of calls to medical and emergency call centres, ambulatory medical care visits at general practitioners, and prescriptions of antibiotics for respiratory diseases. Meteorological parameters were extracted from data supplied by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecast. Data on air pollutant levels were extracted from the air quality database of the European Environmental Agency for different measurement sites. In addition to descriptive analyses, a backward elimination procedure was performed to identify variables associated with medical outcome variables. Afterwards, generalised additive models (GAM) were used to verify whether the selected variables had a linear or nonlinear impact on the medical outcomes. The analyses demonstrated associations between environmental parameters and daily frequencies of different medical outcomes, such as visits at GPs and air pressure (-27 % per 10 hPa change) or ozone (-24 % per 10 mug/m(3) change). The results of the GAM indicated that the effects of some covariates, such as carbon monoxide on consultations at GPs, or humidity on medical calls in general, were nonlinear, while the type of association varied between medical outcomes. These data suggest that the multiple, complex effect of environmental factors on medical outcomes should not be assumed homogeneous or linear a priori and that different settings might be associated with different types of associations.

N1  - Comment in (CIN)
N2  - Previous studies have suggested that variants in the protocadherin-1 (PCDH1) gene, which is important for cell-cell adhesion, are associated with asthma, bronchial, hyperresponsiveness and atopic dermatitis in school children. Our aim was to associate common variants of the PCDH1 gene with longitudinally assessed asthma phenotypes and atopic dermatitis in early childhood. We analysed eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms in PCDH1 from 411 children born to asthmatic mothers from the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood birth cohort. Asthma and atopic dermatitis were diagnosed prospectively to the age of 7 years and asthma was categorised by temporal pattern: transient early respiratory symptoms, persistent symptoms and late-onset symptoms. Bronchial responsiveness was measured at age 6 years. We used additive genetic models. Kaplan-Meier plots revealed early onset in hetero- and homozygotes for the rs10063472-T allele. Significant association was observed between the transient early phenotype and rs10063472-T (transient early versus all: OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.21-3.01, p=0.0058; transient early versus asymptomatic: OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.23-3.25, p=0.0053). No association was observed for other symptom patterns or bronchial responsiveness. Significant association was observed for atopic dermatitis and rs11167761-A (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.24-2.75, p=0.0026). Common variations in PCDH1 increase the risk of developing both transient early asthma and atopic dermatitis in early childhood.

N2  - Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a highly malignant tumor of developing muscle that can occur anywhere in the body. Due to its rarity, relatively little is known about the epidemiology of RMS. Atopic disease is hypothesized to be protective against several malignancies; however, to our knowledge, there have been no assessments of atopy and childhood RMS. Therefore, we explored this association in a case-control study of 322 childhood RMS cases and 322 pair-matched controls. Cases were enrolled in a trial run by the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group. Controls were matched to cases on race, sex and age. The following atopic conditions were assessed: allergies, asthma, eczema and hives; in addition, we examined other immune-related factors: birth order, day-care attendance and breastfeeding. Conditional logistic-regression models were used to calculate an odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each exposure, adjusted for age, race, sex, household income and parental education. As the two most common histologic types of RMS are embryonal (n=215) and alveolar (n=66), we evaluated effect heterogeneity of these exposures. Allergies (OR=0.60, 95% CI: 0.41-0.87), hives (OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.38-0.97), day-care attendance (OR=0.48, 95% CI: 0.32-0.71) and breastfeeding for >= 12 months (OR=0.36, 95% CI: 0.18-0.70) were inversely associated with childhood RMS. These exposures did not display significant effect heterogeneity between histologic types (p>0.52 for all exposures). This is the first study indicating that atopic exposures may be protective against childhood RMS, suggesting additional studies are needed to evaluate the immune system's role in the development of this tumor.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Undernutrition during critical periods of growth and development may permanently affect lung physiology and function., OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether acute undernutrition in childhood or young adulthood increases the risk of later hospitalization for obstructive airways disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or asthma., METHODS: We studied 7,841 women from Prospect-EPIC who experienced the 1944-45 Dutch famine between ages 0 and 21. Pulmonary outcomes were measured by registered hospital admissions and exposure-blinded computed tomography (CT) in a subgroup of 295 women. With Cox proportional hazard regression we explored effects of famine exposure on risk of hospitalization for obstructive airways disease, COPD, and asthma. With logistic regression we explored effects of famine on risk of CT evidence of pulmonary disease., RESULTS: Risks of hospitalization for obstructive airways disease, copd, and asthma were increased after moderate famine exposure, and significantly increased after severe famine exposure: hazard ratios for obstructive airways disease were 1.31 (95% CI: 0.97 to 1.77) and 1.57 (95% CI: 1.10 to 2.23) respectively. Associations between famine exposure and hospitalization for COPD were stronger in ever-smokers than in never-smokers., CONCLUSIONS: Acute undernutrition in childhood or young adulthood is associated with an increased risk of later COPD and asthma hospitalization, possibly through increased sensitivity for tobacco smoke.

T1  - Respiratory syncytial virus and reactive airway disease.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Reactive airway disease (RAD) is a general term for respiratory illnesses manifested by wheezing. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) results in wheezing, either by causing bronchiolitis or by inducing acute exacerbations of asthma. There has been a long-standing interest in whether severe RSV bronchiolitis in infancy is a risk factor for the development of asthma later in childhood. While epidemiologic studies have suggested that such a link exists, a very recent study suggests that infants with greater airways responsiveness to methacholine instead have an increased prevalence of severe RSV bronchiolitis. Increased airways responsiveness to methacholine has been implicated as a key factor for loss of lung function in asthmatic subjects, suggesting that instead of being causal, severe RSV infection may instead be a marker of a predisposing factor for asthma. In this chapter, we will explore the evidence that RSV infection leads to RAD in infants and adults, and how these different forms of RAD may be linked.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - On the basis of strong research evidence and consensus, (1) (2) (3) (4) human metapneumovirus is a leading cause of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children. On the basis of research evidence and consensus, (3) (5) (6) (7) the clinical features of MPV-associated disease are similar to those of RSV. MPV is an important cause of asthma exacerbations, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. Bacterial superinfection can occur.On the basis of research evidence and consensus, (2) (3) (8) the mean age of infection is 6 to 12 months, and nearly all school-age children are seropositive. However, infection can recur, likely in part due to impaired CD8+ T-cell response. On the basis of research evidence and consensus, (9) (10) (11) morbidity and mortality are the highest in patients who are premature, are immunosuppressed, or have underlying cardiopulmonary abnormalities. On the basis of research evidence and consensus, (2) commercially available diagnostic tests exist, and reverse transcriptase-PCR is the most commonly used. On the basis of consensus, because of a lack of relevant clinical studies, recombinant virus vaccines and monoclonal antibodies may be useful as prophylactics or therapeutics. (10)

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence, epidemiological characteristics, and risk factors for childhood asthma in Yichang City, China and to collect evidence for the early diagnosis and preventive treatment of asthma., METHODS: Preliminary screening questionnaires were distributed to more than 90% of children in 5 kindergartens, 10 primary and secondary schools, and 5 communities in Yichang City to detect children with suspected asthma. These surveyed children were selected by cluster random sampling. A further questionnaire survey was conducted for suspected cases. Meanwhile, a similar number of sex- and age-matched non-asthmatic children were selected for the case-control study. Information from returned questionnaires was entered into a database for statistical analysis., RESULTS: A total of 11 000 questionnaires were distributed, and 10 456 (95.1%) questionnaires were returned. The prevalence rate of asthma among children in Yichang was 3.47%, significantly higher in boys than in girls (P<0.05). A total of 107 out of 363 children with asthma had a history of drug allergy, and 152 cases had a family history of allergy. The majority of asthmatic children had irregular onset-prone seasons and hours. Respiratory tract infections were the most common trigger of asthma attacks, accounting for 93.1% of all onsets; family history of allergy, history of early use of antibiotics, history of housing renovation, and history of passive smoking were the major risk factors for asthma., CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of respiratory tract infections may reduce the frequency of asthma attacks; reducing the use of antibiotics during early childhood, decreasing the frequency of housing renovation, and advocating for smoking cessation among parents have preventive effects on asthma.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The exposure to air pollution has negative effects on human health, increasing the risk of respiratory diseases, such as asthma. Few data are yet available on the epidemiology of childhood asthma in some areas of Italy. The aim of the study was to estimate asthma prevalence and related risk factors in children and adolescents residents around the industrial area of Termoli, Molise region, Central-South Italy., METHODS: Prevalence was assessed through the administration of modified ISAAC questionnaires filled out by parents of 89 children and adolescents for the identification of confirmed and probable cases, and by analyzing pediatricians' databases on drug prescriptions for symptoms control and treatment of assisted population in the study area (n = 1,004), compared to a control area (n = 920) with lower industrialization. The association of asthma with risk factors was evaluated by univariate (Chi-square or Fisher's Exact test) and regression logistic analysis., RESULTS: A total of 22 (24.7%) asthmatics were identified, including both confirmed (n = 7; 7.9%) and probable cases (n = 15; 16.8%), most of them (n = 17; 77.3%) resident of Termoli town. All asthma cases were georeferenced based on the residence, however clusters were not found. Using drug prescriptions analysis, a higher prevalence (n = 138; 13.7%) of diagnosed cases was found. Lifetime history of both atopic dermatitis and bronchitis were significantly relateds to asthma cases, as well as an elevated body mass index, whose association is consistent with prevalence data of overweight/obese children living in the study area. Moreover, being resident of the town of Termoli was associated to the occurrence of cases., CONCLUSIONS: Although our data indicated a prevalence concordance with previous national studies in pediatric population, a definitive correlation with environmental industrial factors present in the study area was not established. However, asthma outcome was significantly associated to individuals living in the town of Termoli that, despite the industrial/manufacturing activities, is also subjected to a higher environmental pressure due to the presence of toll road, state highway, railroad, and seaport which may cause air pollution from motor vehicle traffic and increase asthma induction. This study provides hitherto unavailable data on asthma in childhood population living in an industrialized area which was never investigated before, could be part of a systematic review or meta-analysis procedure, might suggest significant findings for larger observational studies, and contribute to complete the frame of disease epidemiology in Italy.

N2  - BACKGROUND: It has been hypothesized that changes in diet during early life may have contributed to the increase in childhood asthma and atopy. The long-term effect of the timing and content of infant feeding on the incidence of asthma and atopic diseases in children is unclear., OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations between duration of breastfeeding and the timing of introduction of complementary foods during the first 6 months and parental-reported asthma, wheeze and atopic eczema up to 10 years of age., METHODS: Infant feeding practices (breastfeeding and introduction of complementary foods) of 1924 singleton children participating in the Study of Eczema and Asthma To Observe the influence of Nutrition (SEATON) birth cohort were prospectively collected up to 6 months with outcomes (wheeze, atopic eczema and asthma) being assessed at 1, 2, 5 and 10 years. Data were analysed using generalized estimating equations and discrete hazards models with adjustment for confounders., RESULTS: By 6 months, 59% and 35% of mothers had stopped exclusive and total breastfeeding, respectively. Although formula feeding was adversely associated with wheeze in the past 12 months (adjusted OR for no formula feeding: 070, 95% CI 0.50-0.97), and the introduction of biscuits/bread after 5 months of age adversely associated with atopic eczema (adjusted OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.06-1.69), these results lost their statistical significance after adjustment for multiple testing. Stratification of the results by the presence of eczema by 6 months of age and family atopic history did not substantially differ from the results of the whole study population., CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our results suggest that the nature of infant feeding during the first 6 months seems not to substantially influence the long-term risk of asthma and atopic diseases in children, nor in children at high risk of atopic disease because of a family history of atopic disease.

N2  - BACKGROUND: We hypothesize that perinatal exposures, in particular the human microbiome and maternal nutrition during pregnancy, interact with the genetic predisposition to cause an abnormal immune modulation in early life towards a trajectory to chronic inflammatory diseases such as asthma and others., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore these interactions by conducting a longitudinal study in an unselected cohort of pregnant women and their offspring with emphasis on deep clinical phenotyping, exposure assessment, and biobanking. Exposure assessments focus on the human microbiome. Nutritional intervention during pregnancy in randomized controlled trials are included in the study to prevent disease and to be able to establish causal relationships., METHODS: Pregnant women from eastern Denmark were invited during 2008-2010 to a novel unselected 'COPSAC2010 ' cohort. The women visited the clinic during pregnancy weeks 24 and 36. Their children were followed at the clinic with deep phenotyping and collection of biological samples at nine regular visits until the age of 3 and at acute symptoms. Randomized controlled trials of high-dose vitamin D and fish oil supplements were conducted during pregnancy, and a trial of azithromycin for acute lung symptoms was conducted in the children with recurrent wheeze., RESULTS: Seven hundred and thirty-eight mothers were recruited from week 24 of gestation, and 700 of their children were included in the birth cohort. The cohort has an over-representation of atopic parents. The participant satisfaction was high and the adherence equally high with 685 children (98%) attending the 1 year clinic visit and 667 children (95%) attending the 2 year clinic visit., CONCLUSIONS: The COPSAC2010 birth cohort study provides longitudinal clinical follow-up with highly specific end-points, exposure assessments, and biobanking. The cohort has a high adherence rate promising strong data to elucidate the interaction between genomics and the exposome in perinatal life leading to lifestyle-related chronic inflammatory disorders such as asthma.

N2  - Wheezing and asthma are significant clinical problems for infants and young children, particularly following premature birth. Recurrent wheezing in infants can progress to persistent asthma. As in adults, altered airway structure (remodeling) and function (increased bronchoconstriction) are also important in neonatal and pediatric airway diseases. Accumulating evidence suggests that airway disease in children is influenced by perinatal factors including perturbations in normal fetal lung development, postnatal interventions in the intensive care unit (ICU) and environmental and other insults in the neonatal period. Here, in addition to genetics, maternal health, environmental processes, innate immunity and impaired lung development/function can all influence pathogenesis of airway disease in children. We summarize current understanding of how prenatal and postnatal factors can contribute to development of airway diseases in neonates and children. Understanding these mechanisms will help identify and develop novel therapies for childhood airway diseases.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy (PIAMA) risk score predicts the probability of having asthma at school age among preschool children with suggestive symptoms., OBJECTIVE: We sought to externally validate the PIAMA risk score at different ages and in ethnic and socioeconomic subgroups of children in addition to updating it., METHODS: We studied 2877 children with preschool asthma-like symptoms participating in the multiethnic, prospective, population-based cohort study Generation R. The PIAMA risk score was assessed at preschool age, and asthma was predicted at age 6 years. Discrimination (concordance index [C-index]) and calibration were calculated. The PIAMA risk score was updated, and its performance was similarly analyzed., RESULTS: At age 6 years, 6% (168/2877) of the children had asthma. The discriminative ability of the original PIAMA risk score to predict asthma in Generation R was similar compared with that in the PIAMA cohort (C-index = 0.74 vs 0.71). The predicted risks by using the original PIAMA risk score for having asthma at the age of 6 years tended to be slightly higher than the observed risks (8% vs 6%). No differences in discriminative ability were found at different ages or in ethnic and socioeconomic subgroups (P > .05). The updated PIAMA risk score had a C-index of 0.75., CONCLUSIONS: The PIAMA risk score showed good external validity. The discriminative ability was similar at different ages and in ethnic and socioeconomic subgroups of preschool children, which suggests good generalizability. Further studies are needed to reproduce the predictive performance of the updated PIAMA risk score in other populations and settings and to assess its clinical relevance.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Maternal asthma is a common pregnancy complication, with adverse short-term effects for the offspring. The objective was to determine whether asthma during pregnancy is a risk factor of offspring diseases., METHODS: We studied pregnant women from the Danish National Birth Cohort (births: 1996-2002; prospective data) giving birth to live singletons (n = 66 712 mother-child pairs), with 4145 (6.2%) women suffering from asthma during pregnancy. We estimated the associations between asthma during pregnancy and offspring diseases (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision diagnoses from national registries), controlling for potential confounders and validating findings by secondary analyses., RESULTS: Offspring median age at end of follow-up was 6.2 (3.6-8.9) years. Asthma was associated with an increased offspring risk of infectious and parasitic diseases (hazard ratio [HR] 1.34; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-1.46), diseases of the nervous system (HR 1.43; CI 1.18-1.73), ear (HR 1.33; CI 1.19-1.48), respiratory system (HR 1.43; CI 1.34-1.52), and skin (HR 1.39; CI 1.20-1.60), and potentially (not confirmed in secondary analyses) of endocrine and metabolic disorders (HR 1.26; CI 1.02-1.55), diseases of the digestive system (HR 1.17; CI 1.04-1.32), and malformations (odds ratio 1.13; CI 1.01-1.26), but not of neoplasms, mental disorders, or diseases of the blood and immune system, circulatory system, musculoskeletal system, and genitourinary system., CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of the associations between asthma during pregnancy and a wide spectrum of offspring diseases. In line with previous data on selected outcomes, asthma during pregnancy may be a risk factor for numerous offspring diseases, suggesting that careful monitoring of women with asthma during pregnancy and their offspring is important.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Difficult airway (DA), including difficult bag-mask ventilation (DBMV), and difficult intubation (DI) is an important challenge for the pediatric anesthesiologist. While expected DBMV can be successfully managed with appropriate equipment and personnel, unexpected DBMV relies on the resources available and the experience of the anesthesiologist at the time of the emergency. The incidence and risk factors of unexpected DA in otherwise healthy children, including DBMV among pediatric patients are not known. The aim of this study was to expand the scientific knowledge of unexpected DBMV among pediatric patients., METHODS: Patients between the ages of 0 and 8 years, undergoing elective surgery requiring bag-mask ventilation BMV and intubation at the Montreal Children's Hospital were recruited in this prospective observational study. Data on the incidence of DBMV and risk factors were collected over a 3-year period., RESULTS: In a sample of 484 children, the incidence of unexpected difficult BMV was 6.6% (95% CI [4.6, 9.2]). The incidence of expected DA among the screened patients (N = 4865) was 0.5% (95% CI [0.3, 0.7]). In a logistic regression analysis, age (OR 0.98; 95%CI [0.97, 0.99]), undergoing otolaryngology (ENT) surgery (OR 2.92; 95% CI [1.08, 7.95]) and use of neuromuscular blocking agents (OR 3.49; 95%CI [1.50-8.11]) were independently associated with DBMV. The incidence of DI was 1.2%. No association between DBMV and DI was found (Fisher's exact test, P = 1.0)., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first published report of the incidence of unexpected DBMV among healthy pediatric patients.

The objective of this study was to define the risk factors associated with readmission following acute asthmatic attacks in children., METHODS: This is a retrospective case-control study in children who were admitted because of acute asthmatic attacks at the Department of Pediatrics, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. The admissions were classified into 2 groups, admission and readmission within one-month to one-year after the first admission. The medical records were reviewed and the factors that might affect readmission were evaluated., RESULTS: Seventy six children, 49 males and 27 females, were included. There were 56 children who were admitted only once and 20 children who were readmitted. The 1-year readmission rate for children with asthma was 26.3 %. The risk factors which made readmission more likely were a parental history of allergic disease (Odd Ratio, OR, = 3.17; 95% CI 1.10-9.10), a history of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission (OR 29.62; 95% CI 3.35-262.18), methylprednisolone usage during the 1st admission (OR 8.33; 95% CI 2.46-28.19) and the level of asthma control. Increased risk of readmission was found in partly controlled asthma (OR 4.83; 95% CI 1.24-18.88) and uncontrolled asthma (OR 29; 95% CI 2.25-373.77). The factor that decreased the chances of readmission was a history of influenza vaccination (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.16-0.36)., CONCLUSION: A history of ICU admission at the first admission and the level of asthma control (partly controlled and uncontrolled according to Global of Initiative for Asthma guideline) increased the chances of readmission while influenza vaccination reduced the chances of readmission.

N2  - BACKGROUND: It has been proposed that maternal obesity during pregnancy may increase the risk that the child develops allergic disease and asthma, although the mechanisms underpinning this relationship are currently unclear. We sought to assess if this association may be due to confounding by genetic or environmental risk factors that are common to maternal obesity and childhood asthma, using a sibling pair analysis., METHODS: The study population comprised a Swedish national cohort of term children born between 1992 and 2008 to native Swedish parents. Maternal body mass index (BMI) was measured at 8-10 weeks gestation. Unconditional logistic regression models were used to determine if maternal obesity was associated with increased risk of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) in 431,718 first-born children, while adjusting for potential confounders. An age-matched discordant sib-pair analysis was performed, taking into account shared genetic and environmental risk factors., RESULTS: Maternal over-weight and obesity were associated with increased risk that the child would require ICS (for BMI>=35 kg/m(2), aOR = 1.30, 95%CI = 1.10-1.52 compared with normal weight mothers) in children aged 6-12 years. Similar effects were seen in younger children, but in children aged 13-16 years, maternal obesity (BMI>=30) was related to increased risk of ICS use in girls (aOR = 1.28, 95%CI = 1.07-1.53) but not boys (OR = 1.05, 95%CI = 0.87-1.26). The sib-pair analysis, which included 2,034 sib-pairs older than six years who were discordant for both ICS use and maternal BMI category, failed to find any evidence that increasing maternal weight was related to increased risk of ICS use., CONCLUSION: Maternal obesity is associated with increased risk of childhood ICS use up to approximately 12 years of age, but only in girls after this age. These effects could not be confirmed in a sib pair analysis, suggesting either limited statistical power, or the effects of maternal BMI may be due to shared genetic or environmental risk factors.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Prospective studies on increased risk of childhood asthma due to exposure to paracetamol and antibiotics in early life have yielded contradictory results. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the association between administration of paracetamol and antibiotics in the first 12 months of life and delayed asthma symptoms later in childhood. This is a cross-sectional study that included 1,063 children from the primary schools in Coimbra, Portugal. ISAAC-based environmental and core asthma and rhinitis questionnaires were used to obtain information about children's respiratory health and administration of paracetamol and antibiotics. We found that early paracetamol use significantly increased the risk of asthma ever (at least one episode in life) (OR = 2.9; 95 %CI:1.8-4.5), current asthma (OR = 2.4; 95 %CI:1.5-3.6), wheezing ever (OR = 2.5; 95 %CI:1.8-3.4), rhinitis ever (OR = 2.4; 95 %CI:1.7-3.3), and current rhinitis (OR = 2.8; 95 %CI:2.0-3.9). Antibiotic exposure showed a similar effect with the risk for current asthma (OR = 1.6; 95 %CI:1.0-2.5), asthma ever (OR = 2.0; 95 %CI:1.3-3.1), wheeze ever (OR = 2.3; 95 %CI:1.7-3.2), and rhinitis symptoms (OR = 1.8; 95 %CI:1.3-2.6, OR = 1.8; 95 %CI:1.3-2.6, OR = 1.9; 95 %CI:1.2-3.0 for rhinitis ever, current rhinitis, and tearing, respectively). We further found that increased frequency of paracetamol use during the last 12 months preceding the study facilitated the appearance of allergic symptoms, suggesting a dose-dependent associations. In conclusion, the study shows a significant association between exposure to paracetamol and antibiotics in the first 12 months of life and both prevalence and severity of asthma and rhinitis symptoms in children 5-9 years old.

T1  - Association between severe eczema in children and multiple comorbid conditions and increased healthcare utilization.
A1  - Silverberg, Jonathan I

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is associated with multiple comorbid conditions, such as asthma and food allergy. We sought to determine the impact of eczema severity on the development of these disorders and other non-atopic comorbidities in AD., METHODS: We used the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health, a prospective questionnaire-based study of a nationally representative sample of 91,642 children aged 0-17 yr. Prevalence and severity of eczema, asthma, hay fever and food allergy, sleep impairment, healthcare utilization, recurrent ear infections, and visual and dental problems were determined., RESULTS: In general, more severe eczema is correlated with poorer overall health, impaired sleep, and increased healthcare utilization, including seeing a specialist, compared with children with mild or moderate disease (Rao-Scott chi-squared test, p < 0.0001). Severe eczema was associated with a higher prevalence of comorbid chronic health disorders, including asthma, hay fever, and food allergies (p < 0.0001). In addition, the severity of eczema was directly related to the severity of the comorbidities. These associations remained significant in multivariate logistic regression models that included age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Severe eczema was also associated with recent dental problems, including bleeding gums (p < 0.0001), toothache (p = 0.0004), but not broken teeth (p = 0.04) or tooth decay (p = 0.13)., CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that severe eczema is associated with multiple comorbid chronic health disorders, impaired overall health, and increased healthcare utilization. Further, these data suggest that children with eczema are at risk of decreased oral health. Future studies are warranted to verify this novel association. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Singapore had its first case of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 on 26 May 2009. As of 3 August 2009, 440 children with confirmed H1N1were admitted to KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective case control study of children admitted from 26 May 2009 to 19 July 2009 with H1N1infection. Cases and controls were first differentiated by whether they were complicated or non-complicated in nature, and subsequently analysed with regards to possible independent risk factors., RESULTS: We analysed 143 admitted children; 48 cases and 95 controls (1: 2 ratio). Significant comorbidity was found in 20.3% (n = 29) of patients with the majority having asthma (n = 18, 12.6 %) followed by obesity (n = 7, 4.9%). Binary logistic regression analysis showed risk factors for complicated disease were comorbidity (adjusted OR 6.0, 95% CI, 2.5 to 14.6, P < 0.0001) and age <2 years (adjusted OR 9.8, 95% CI, 2.4 to 40, P = 0.001). Age less than 5 years was not found to be a risk factor., CONCLUSION: In the early stages of an evolving influenza epidemic when oseltamivir stocks are low, oseltamivir treatment for influenza can be streamlined and offered to those at highest risk who are under 2 years old or have significant comorbidity to prevent complicated disease.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Canada was one of the first countries affected by the 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic with two waves - one from May to June and one from October to December. The 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic had many unique features when compared with seasonal influenza, including the following: more than half of the affected people were children; asthma was the most significant risk factor for hospital admission; and Aboriginal and pregnant women had a higher risk of hospital admission and complications. Antiviral therapy was widely used but data did not show any effect on the pediatric population. Outbreak spread was possibly promoted from child-child and child-adult contact, and therefore the vaccination campaign targeted the pediatric population and achieved good coverage among young children (57%). Vaccination efficacy was difficult to test because of the vaccination delay. Improvement in models of prevention and treatment are urgently needed to prepare for the possible future pandemics.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Previous cross-sectional studies have suggested an association between asthma and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but the temporal relationship was not determined. Using a nationwide population-based prospective case-control cohort study (1:4, age-/gender-matched), we hypothesized that asthma in infanthood or early childhood would increase the risk of ADHD in later life., METHODS: In all, 2,294 children with asthma and 9,176 controls aged between 0 and 3 years in 2000 were included in our study. Cases of ADHD that occurred to the end of follow-up (31 December 2010) were identified., RESULTS: Children with asthma had a higher incidence of developing ADHD (7% vs. 4.6%, p < .001) than control cohort during the follow-up period. After adjusting for age at enrollment, gender, level of urbanization, and comorbid allergic diseases (allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis), children with asthma had an elevated risk (HR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.07-1.59) of developing ADHD compared with control group., DISCUSSION: Our prospective study supported a temporal relationship between asthma and ADHD. Asthma in very early life increased the risk of developing ADHD during the school years. Further studies are required to investigate whether the prompt treatment of asthma and comorbid allergic diseases could prevent the development of ADHD or decrease ADHD symptoms.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk factors for asthma in children in Hefei, China and to provide a strategy for asthma control in this region., METHODS: A total of 400 children with a confirmed diagnosis of asthma, as well as 400 children of comparable age, sex, living environment, and family background, who had no respiratory diseases, were selected for a case-control study. A survey questionnaire survey was completed for all children. The obtained data were subjected to univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine the risk factors for asthma., RESULTS: The logistic regression analysis showed that a family history of allergy, allergic rhinitis, infantile eczema, no breastfeeding, air-conditioning and passive smoking were the risk factors for asthma in children, with odds ratios of 9.63, 7.56, 4.58, 2.16, 1.73, and 1.55 respectively., CONCLUSIONS: In order to reduce the incidence of asthma, we should advocate breast feeding, promote outdoor activities, keep ventilation natural, prevent passive smoking and cure allergic rhinitis.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although atopic sensitization is one of the strongest risk factors for asthma, its relationship with asthma is poorly understood. We hypothesize that 'atopy' encompasses multiple sub-phenotypes that relate to asthma in different ways., METHODS: In two population-based birth cohorts (Manchester and Isle of Wight - IoW), we used a machine learning approach to independently cluster children into different classes of atopic sensitization in an unsupervised manner, based on skin prick and sIgE tests taken throughout childhood and adolescence. We examined the qualitative cluster properties and their relationship to asthma and lung function., RESULTS: A five-class solution best described the data in both cohorts, with striking similarity between the classes across the two populations. Compared with nonsensitized class, children in the class with sensitivity to a wide variety of allergens (~1/3 of children atopic by conventional definition) were much more likely to have asthma (aOR [95% CI0; 20.1 [10.9-40.2] in Manchester and 11.9 [7.3-19.4] in IoW). The relationship between asthma and conventional atopy was much weaker (5.5 [3.4-8.8] in Manchester and 5.8 [4.1-8.3] in IoW). In both cohorts, children in this class had significantly poorer lung function (FEV1 /FVC lower by 4.4% in Manchester and 2.6% in IoW; P < 0.001), most reactive airways, highest eNO and most hospital admissions for asthma (P < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: By adopting a machine learning approach to longitudinal data on allergic sensitization from two independent unselected birth cohorts, we identified latent classes with strikingly similar patterns of atopic response and association with clinical outcomes, suggesting the existence of multiple atopy phenotypes.

N2  - RATIONALE: Innate immune responses marked by increases in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha have been associated with asthma but whether such alterations are evident before symptoms is not yet clear., OBJECTIVES: To determine if prevalence of childhood asthma or asthma-related traits is predicted by perinatal innate immune status and if maternal factors related to pregnancy influence asthma prevalence and innate immune status., METHODS: In the Tucson Infant Immune Study (a nonselected birth cohort), presence of eczema and wheezing in the child's first year and physician-diagnosed asthma through age 9 and asthma in the parents was obtained from parent-completed questionnaires. TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-12 were measured in supernatants of LPS-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells at birth and 3 months as was TNF-alpha in plasma. TNF-alpha single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped by Sequenom. Percent predicted FEV1/FVC was measured at age 9. Maternal weight gain during pregnancy and prepregnancy weight were ascertained from medical records., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Infants with persistently elevated LPS-induced TNF-alpha at birth and 3 months were at increased risk for childhood asthma (odds ratio [OR], 4.1; confidence interval [CI], 1.9-8.8; n = 233; P = 0.0003) and had decreased FEV1/FVC ratios at age 9. Children with mothers in the top tertile for pregnancy weight gain had increased risk for asthma (OR, 3.4; CI, 1.7-6.9; n = 225; P = 0.001) and persistently elevated TNF-alpha in early life (OR, 2.9; CI, 1.4-8.2; n = 195; P = 0.013). These relations were independent of maternal asthma and rhinitis., CONCLUSIONS: Persistently elevated LPS-induced TNF-alpha production early in life acts as a predictive biomarker for childhood asthma, and excess pregnancy weight gain in the mother seems to contribute to both.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk of herpes zoster (HZ) in children with and without asthma., STUDY DESIGN: This study was designed as a population-based case-control study. We examined all children (aged <18 years) with possible HZ in Olmsted County, Minnesota, between 1996 and 2001 (n = 306; identified by International Classification of Diseases, Eighth Revision codes and predetermined criteria for HZ) to identify true cases. To determine the association between asthma and HZ, we compared the frequency of asthma among children with HZ with that among age- and sex-matched corresponding controls (1:1 matching) who resided in Olmsted County, Minnesota, during the study period. Asthma was ascertained based on predetermined criteria. A conditional logistic regression model was used to calculate ORs and 95% CIs., RESULTS: We identified 277 eligible patients with HZ, 63 (23%) of whom had a history of asthma before the index date of HZ, compared with 35 of 277 (12.6%) matched controls (aOR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.24-3.52; P = .006), adjusting for varicella vaccination and atopy status. The population-attributable risk percentage was 12%. Controlling for asthma and atopy status, varicella vaccination was associated with reduced risk of HZ (aOR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.21-0.92; P = .028)., CONCLUSION: Asthma may be an unrecognized risk factor for reactivation of a non-airway-related latent infection such as HZ in children.

N2  - AIM: To provide a comprehensive integration of contemporary studies focusing on the relationship between obesity and asthma in paediatric populations., BACKGROUND: The simultaneous increase in asthma and obesity prevalence has been widely discussed over the past 20 years. Although studies have discovered a positive correlation between the two, evidence-based findings are needed to develop nursing interventions., DESIGN: A quantitative systematic review on the literature was conducted from June-December 2011., DATA SOURCES: An electronic database search was conducted for studies published between January 1966-May 2011. Additional articles were identified through the reference lists of reviewed papers., REVIEW METHODS: Inclusion/exclusion criteria and quality appraisal were applied to ensure research primarily designed to study the relationship between obesity and asthma in children was included., RESULTS: The majority of studies support a positive association between obesity and asthma in children. Among correlates recognized as important effect modifiers, gender was the most prominent, with obese girls more likely to have asthma diagnoses than obese boys. Scrutinization of covariates in selected studies revealed that most related to children's demographic characteristics and were inconsistent across the studies., CONCLUSIONS: This review was designed to integrate contemporary scientific findings on the association between obesity and asthma by including a large number of studies with variant research designs. To identify high-risk groups and develop nursing interventions to help children affected by both epidemics, more interdisciplinary and well-designed investigations focusing on an expanded spectrum of correlates including demographic and behavioural factors are warranted.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The risk of allergic diseases among Kawasaki disease (KD) patients relative to the general population is not known. The aim of this study was to perform a population-based cohort study to investigate the risk of allergic diseases among children after KD in Taiwan- a country with the third highest incidence of KD in the world., METHODS: Data were obtained from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. In total, 253 patients who were 5 years of age or younger and had a first-time hospitalization with a diagnosis of KD between 1997 and 2005 were included as the study cohort and 1,012 non-KD patients matched for age and sex were included as comparison cohort. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to adjust for confounding and to compare the 6-year allergic-free survival rate between these two cohorts., RESULTS: The incidence rate of allergic diseases (184.66 per 1000 person-year) was significantly higher in the KD cohort than in the control cohort (124.99 per 1000 person-years). After adjusting for potential confounders, the adjusted hazard ratios of asthma and allergic rhinitis were 1.51 (95% confidence interval = 1.17-1.95) and 1.30 (95% confidence interval = 1.04-1.62), respectively., CONCLUSION: We conclude that KD patients were at an increased risk for allergic diseases compared with the comparison cohort.

N2  - Incidence and prevalence rates of asthma can vary greatly according to population and location. The National Heart and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health defines asthma as a common chronic disorder of the airways that involves a complex interaction of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and an underlying inflammation. This article uses the most common definitions and diagnostic methods for asthma. In 2009 there were 2.1 million asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits. ED visits lend an opportunity for providers to identify and intervene in the care of patients whose asthma is poorly controlled. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - According to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) classification, mild asthma includes intermittent and mild persistent asthma. It represents more than 75% of asthmatic children. The symptoms and functional impact are well described. Mild asthma can lead to severe exacerbations. Progression to more severe disease may occur. Consequently, it is important to diagnose mild asthma, to initiate the appropriate treatment early, and to identify the risk factors for aggravation. Nevertheless, mild asthma is under-diagnosed and under-treated. Bronchial inflammation and remodeling are observed in mild asthma. A daily low-dose of inhaled corticosteroids is the reference treatment for mild persistent asthma. Intermittent inhaled corticosteroids cannot be recommended in children with mild persistent asthma.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the influence of socioeconomic status (SES) on hospital admissions for respiratory conditions associated with ambient particulate matter that is 2.5 micrometers or less in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) in children aged 1 to 9 years in 12 California counties, from 2000 to 2005., METHODS: We linked daily hospital admissions for respiratory conditions (acute respiratory infections, pneumonia, and asthma) to meteorological, air pollution, and census data., RESULTS: In San Diego, San Bernardino, Riverside, and Los Angeles counties, the admission rates for children associated with PM2.5 ranged from 1.03 to 1.07 for combined respiratory conditions and 1.03 to 1.08 for asthma in regions with lower SES. We observed 2 distinct patterns of the influence of the composite SES Townsend index. In lower-SES South Coast areas, PM2.5-associated hospital admission rates for all respiratory outcomes were predominantly positive whereas results in the Central Valley were variable, often tending toward the null., CONCLUSIONS: These distinct patterns could be attributed to the heterogeneity of regional confounders as well as the seasonal variation of emission sources of PM2.5. Composite SES is one potential factor for increasing susceptibility to air pollution.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The causal link between body mass index (BMI) or obesity and asthma in children is still being debated. Analyses of large longitudinal studies with a sufficient number of incident cases and in which the time-dependent processes of both excess weight and asthma development can be validly analyzed are lacking., OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate whether the course of BMI predicts incident asthma in childhood., METHODS: Data from 12,050 subjects of 8 European birth cohorts on asthma and allergies were combined. BMI and doctor-diagnosed asthma were modeled during the first 6 years of life with latent growth mixture modeling and discrete time hazard models. Subpopulations of children were identified with similar standardized BMI trajectories according to age- and sex-specific "World Health Organization (WHO) child growth standards" and "WHO growth standards for school aged children and adolescents" for children up to age 5 years and older than 5 years, respectively (BMI-SDS). These types of growth profiles were analyzed as predictors for incident asthma., RESULTS: Children with a rapid BMI-SDS gain in the first 2 years of life had a higher risk for incident asthma up to age 6 years than children with a less pronounced weight gain slope in early childhood. The hazard ratio was 1.3 (95% CI, 1.1-1.5) after adjustment for birth weight, weight-for-length at birth, gestational age, sex, maternal smoking in pregnancy, breast-feeding, and family history of asthma or allergies. A rapid BMI gain at 2 to 6 years of age in addition to rapid gain in the first 2 years of life did not significantly enhance the risk of asthma., CONCLUSION: Rapid growth in BMI during the first 2 years of life increases the risk of asthma up to age 6 years.

T1  - Impact of single nucleotide polymorphism in tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene 308G/A in Egyptian asthmatic children and wheezing infants.

N2  - Bronchial asthma is a common disease with multiple determinants that include genetic variation. Although tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is a major pro-inflammatory cytokine, the functions of genetic polymorphisms in this cytokine has not been thoroughly examined in the context of asthma pathology. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in TNF-alpha is associated with asthma and wheezing and whether the association is related to the severity of the disease and other epidemiological factors. Frequencies of TNF-alpha-308G/A polymorphism were compared in 100 asthmatic children, 100 wheezy infants and 100 age and gender matched controls. Genotype frequencies for TNF-alpha-308G/A were significantly higher in asthmatic children (60%) and wheezy infants (68%) than the control group (30%). Higher serum levels of TNF-alpha were observed in genotypes G/A and G/G of asthmatic children and wheezy infants than in controls. No association was found between the G/A polymorphism and the severity of the disease, the total eosinophil count and IgE levels in both groups. We can conclude that genetic variation in TNF-alpha-308G/A may contribute to childhood asthma and wheezing. These findings could be helpful for future early intervention studies which may have a potential impact on family counseling and management.

N2  - BACKGROUND: It has been hypothesised that postnatal weight and length/height gain are variously related to wheeze, asthma and atopy; however, supporting evidence is limited and inconsistent., METHODS: Weights and lengths/heights of 12,171 term infants were measured from birth to 12 months and at 6.5 yr and extracted from polyclinic records prospectively obtained between 12 and 60 months. Atopic phenotypes were ascertained at 6.5 yr with the International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood questionnaire and skin prick tests. Logistic regression models investigated whether rates of weight and length/height gain from infancy to mid-childhood were associated with atopy phenotypes that have occurred ever or in the last 12 months., RESULTS: After controlling for confounders and prior weight and length/height gain, all weight gain variables except birth weight were positively associated with ever having wheezed (p < 0.1). A one s.d. increase in weight gain rate between 0 and 3 months was associated with a 12% increase (2-23%) in allergic rhinitis ever. No other consistent patterns of association were found for weight gain or length/height gain rate between 0 and 60 months with atopic outcomes at 6.5 yr. In contrast, all atopy outcomes except for ever having asthma were associated with current weight and height, even after controlling for prior growth., CONCLUSION: Current height and weight are more strongly associated with the development of atopic phenotypes in childhood than patterns of infant and early childhood growth, which may well reflect reverse causality (atopy effects on growth) or residual confounding by an unknown common cause of growth and atopy.

Data from a historical cohort of children followed from birth to 6 years (SLAM cohort) were used. Wheezing episodes until 36 months and asthma at 6 years were both recorded by a doctor. Monthly mean incidence rate of wheezing and rate ratio were calculated. Joinpoint regression models were built to identify breakpoints in the risk of wheeze. Complete information was available for 3739 children. Wheezing in the first 36 months was more frequent in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic children (rate ratio 2.62, 95% CI 1.81-3.78). Differences were appreciable within the first months and increased steadily thereafter because of a persistently high rate in asthmatic children. No breakpoint in the rate ratio could be identified. Asthmatic children exhibited a one-phase curve of incidence and nonasthmatic children exhibited a two-phase curve. However, children with allergic asthma also displayed a two-phase curve. There is no identifiable breakpoint during the first 36 months of life at which the incidence of wheezing in asthmatic children begins to stand out.

N2  - Over the last decades many epidemiologic studies considered the morbidity patterns for respiratory diseases and lung function of children in the context of ambient air pollution usually measured in the postnatal period. The main purpose of this study is to assess the impact of prenatal exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on the recurrent broncho-pulmonary infections in early childhood. The study included 214 children who had measurements of personal prenatal PM2.5 exposure and regularly collected data on the occurrence of acute bronchitis and pneumonia diagnosed by a physician from birth over the seven-year follow-up. The effect of prenatal exposure to PM2.5 was adjusted in the multivariable logistic models for potential confounders, such as prenatal and postnatal ETS (environmental tobacco smoke), city residence area as a proxy of postnatal urban exposure, children's sensitization to domestic aeroallergens, and asthma. In the subgroup of children with available PM2.5 indoor levels, the effect of prenatal exposure was additionally adjusted for indoor exposure as well. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for incidence of recurrent broncho-pulmonary infections (five or more spells of bronchitis and/or pneumonia) recorded in the follow-up significantly correlated in a dose-response manner with the prenatal PM2.5 level (OR=2.44, 95%CI: 1.12-5.36). In conclusion, the study suggests that prenatal exposure to PM2.5 increases susceptibility to respiratory infections and may program respiratory morbidity in early childhood. The study also provides evidence that the target value of 20mug/m(3) for the 24-h mean level of PM2.5 protects unborn babies better than earlier established EPA guidelines.

N2  - Data on baseline characteristics of children with asthma to predict individual treatment responses are lacking. We aimed to set up a data-collection system which can easily fill this gap in clinical practice.A web-based application was developed, named 'Portal for children with respiratory and allergic symptoms', hereafter called Electronic Portal (EP). It contains health- and disease-related questionnaires on respiratory- and allergic diseases. All patients, 1-18 years of age, with respiratory- and/or allergic complaints are invited to enter the EP before their first visit. By using the EP large amounts of data, gathered during routine patient care can be used for research purposes. This may help to further investigate the different treatment related asthma phenotypes and will be helpful to monitor risk factors for other atopic diseases and respiratory infections.

N2  - We identified a total of 595 Finnish children born in 1994-2008 and diagnosed as having inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by October 2010 from the National Reimbursement Register (based on certificates including the diagnostic criteria) to determine whether the presence of cow's milk allergy (CMA) or asthma is associated with the risk of contracting IBD (altogether 2380 matched controls). A diagnosis of CMA in infancy was associated with Crohn disease (odds ratio [OR] 1.92, confidence interval [CI] 1.09-3.36, P < 0.05) and ulcerative colitis (OR 1.71, CI 1.04-2.83, P < 0.05), but childhood asthma only with Crohn disease (OR 2.33, CI 1.41-3.86, P = 0.001). Thus, CMA in infants is a risk factor for contracting pediatric IBD and accordingly, asthma for Crohn disease.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Obesity and asthma have increased in westernised countries. Maternal obesity may increase childhood asthma risk. If this relation is causal, it may be mediated through factors associated with maternal adiposity, such as fetal development, pregnancy complications or infant adiposity. We investigated the relationships of maternal body mass index (BMI) and fat mass with childhood wheeze, and examined the influences of infant weight gain and childhood obesity., METHODS: Maternal prepregnancy BMI and estimated fat mass (from skinfold thicknesses) were related to asthma, wheeze and atopy in 940 children. Transient or persistent/late wheeze was classified using questionnaire data collected at ages 6, 12, 24 and 36 months and 6 years. At 6 years, skin-prick testing was conducted and exhaled nitric oxide and spirometry measured. Infant adiposity gain was calculated from skinfold thickness at birth and 6 months., RESULTS: Greater maternal BMI and fat mass were associated with increased childhood wheeze (relative risk (RR) 1.08 per 5 kg/m(2), p=0.006; RR 1.09 per 10 kg, p=0.003); these reflected associations with transient wheeze (RR 1.11, p=0.003; RR 1.13, p=0.002, respectively), but not with persistent wheeze or asthma. Infant adiposity gain was associated with persistent wheeze, but not significantly. Adjusting for infant adiposity gain or BMI at 3 or 6 years did not reduce the association between maternal adiposity and transient wheeze. Maternal adiposity was not associated with offspring atopy, exhaled nitric oxide, or spirometry., DISCUSSION: Greater maternal adiposity is associated with transient wheeze but not asthma or atopy, suggesting effects upon airway structure/function but not allergic predisposition.

N2  - Severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in infancy is associated with substantial morbidity worldwide; whether it is a risk factor for childhood asthma is contentious. A systematic review of 28 articles was conducted, summarizing estimates of asthma risk after RSV hospitalization during infancy. Prevalence estimates of asthma, among those hospitalized for RSV in infancy, were from 8% to 63%, 10% to 92%, and 37%, at ages <5, 5 to 11, and >= 12 years, respectively. These rates were higher than those among non-hospitalized comparisons. The attributable risk of asthma due to RSV ranged from 13% to 22% and from 11% to 27% among children aged <= 5 and aged 5 to 11, respectively, and was 32% among children >= 12 years of age. Overall, 59% of asthma prevalence estimates from those previously hospitalized for RSV exceeded 20%, compared to only 6% of non-hospitalized comparison estimates. Despite variability in asthma prevalence estimates after RSV-related hospitalization, available data suggest a link between severe RSV infection in infancy and childhood asthma.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is commonly associated with asthma and other atopic disorders in childhood., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the natural history of AD and its association with other allergic outcomes in a high-risk cohort through the age of 7 years., METHODS: A total of 373 high-risk infants, who had undergone a randomized controlled trial with intervention measures for primary prevention of asthma applied during the first year of life, were assessed for asthma, AD, and allergic sensitization at 1, 2, and 7 years., RESULTS: The multifaceted intervention program did not reduce AD despite reducing the prevalence of asthma significantly. Sixty-two children (16.6%) had AD during the first 2 years (early-onset AD); of these, 26 continue to have AD at the age of 7 years (persistent), whereas 36 no longer had the disease (nonpersistent) at the age of 7 years. Twenty-three children (6.2%) developed AD only after the age of 2 years (late-onset AD). Early-onset AD, persistent or nonpersistent, was associated with increased risk of allergic sensitization to food allergens within the first 2 years of life and asthma diagnosis at year 7. However, only persistent AD was associated with an increased risk of other atopic diseases and allergic sensitization to food and aeroallergens at year 7. Late-onset AD was not associated with atopic diseases or allergic sensitization at year 7 with the exception of Alternaria alternans., CONCLUSION: In this cohort of infants at high risk of asthma, early-onset persistent AD, which was highly associated with atopic sensitization, increased the risk of atopic diseases in later childhood and thus appears to be part of the atopic march.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The medical home likely has a positive effect on outpatient outcomes for children with asthma. However, no information is available regarding the impact of medical home quality on health care utilization after hospitalizations. We sought to explore the relationship between medical home quality and readmission risk in children hospitalized for asthma exacerbations., METHODS: We enrolled 601 children, aged 1 to 16 years, hospitalized for an acute asthma exacerbation at a single pediatric facility that captures >85% of all asthma admissions in an 8-county area. Caregivers completed the Parent's Perception of Primary Care (P3C), a Likert-based, validated survey. The P3C yields a total score of medical home quality and 6 subscale scores assessing continuity, access, contextual knowledge, comprehensiveness, communication, and coordination. Asthma readmission events were prospectively collected via billing data. Hazards of readmission were calculated by using Cox proportional hazards adjusting for chronic asthma severity and key measures of socioeconomic status., RESULTS: Overall P3C score was not associated with readmission. Among the subscale comparisons, only children with lowest access had a statistically increased readmission risk compared with children with the best access. Subgroup analysis revealed that children with private insurance and good access had the lowest rates of readmission within a year compared with other combinations of insurance and access., CONCLUSIONS: Among measured aspects of medical home in a cohort of hospitalized children with asthma, having poor access to a medical home was the only measure associated with increased readmission. Improving physician access for children with asthma may lower hospital readmission.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There are limited prospective data on long-term exposure to air pollution and effects on childhood respiratory morbidity. We investigated the development of asthma and related symptoms longitudinally over the first 12 years of life in relation to air pollution from road traffic., METHODS: The Swedish birth cohort BAMSE (Children, Allergy, Milieu, Stockholm, Epidemiological Survey) includes 4089 children who were followed up with repeated questionnaires and blood samples for up to 12 years of age. Residential, daycare, and school addresses, time-activity patterns, emission databases, and dispersion models were used to estimate individual exposure to particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <10 mum (PM10) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from traffic., RESULTS: Overall, the data suggested possible associations between exposure to air pollution during the first year of life and asthma and wheezing in children up to 12 years of age. Asthma risks seemed to be particularly increased in children age 8 to 12 years; the overall odds ratio was 2.0 (95% confidence interval = 1.1-3.5), and for nonallergic asthma, the odds ratio was 3.8 (0.9-16.2) for a 5th to 95th percentile increase in time-weighted average exposure to PM10 (corresponding to 7.2 micro g/m). Results were similar using exposure to traffic-NOx., CONCLUSIONS: We found modest positive associations between air pollution exposure from traffic during infancy and asthma in children during the first 12 years of life, with stronger effects suggested for nonallergic asthma.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between maternal fecundity factors and time to pregnancy and risk of asthma in offspring., DESIGN: Retrospective observational hospital-based birth cohort study., SETTING: A university-based obstetrics and gynecology department., PATIENT(S): A total of 40,914 women, who delivered between 1989 and 2007, were linked with the register for asthma reimbursement (n = 2,577) for their offspring. Fecundity factors were recorded during pregnancy. Logistic regression analyses were used., INTERVENTION(S): None., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Asthma among offspring., RESULT(S): The risk of asthma was significantly increased if the mother had any infertility problems (adjusted odds ratio [adjusted OR] 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19-1.63), medical infertility treatment (aOR 1.43, 95% CI 1.13-1.80), or any infertility treatment (aOR 1.50, 95% CI 1.26-1.79). The risk of asthma among offspring was also higher among mothers who had more than two miscarriages (aOR 1.25, 95% CI 1.04-1.51) and time to pregnancy over 3 months (aOR 1.25, 95% CI 1.07-1.45)., CONCLUSION(S): These findings suggest that maternal subfertility exposes offspring to an increased risk of asthma., CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: The study is registered in Kuopio University Hospital register (TUTKI): ID 5302448.

N2  - Bronchiolitis in infancy is a risk factor for development of asthma in the first decades of life, although the majority may be asymptomatic at school age. Respiratory symptoms are common in early life, and prediction of later asthma may be challenging. We aimed to study if simple clinical variables assessed at 2 years of age could predict asthma at 11 years of age and thereby provide a basis for follow-up and treatment after bronchiolitis in infancy. The study included 105 children hospitalized for bronchiolitis during their first year of life. Of these, 101 (96.2%) participated in the first follow-up at 2 years of age and 93 (88.6%) in the second follow-up at age 11. The overall prevalence of asthma at 11 years of age was 22.6%. Among the risk factors assessed at 2 years of age, recurrent wheeze appeared most important (odds ratio for later asthma: 7.2; 95% confidence interval: 1.3, 41.6; P = 0.015). Tested separately, recurrent wheeze had high sensitivity (90.5%), but low specificity (58.3%), low negative likelihood ratio (LR) (0.2) and low negative post-test probability (4.5%); indicating that absence of recurrent wheeze was better suited to exclude than to predict asthma at 11 years of age. Combining recurrent wheeze with either parental atopy, parental asthma or atopic dermatitis improved the specificity (>80), positive LR (>3) and positive post-test probability (~50%), rendering the combinations more appropriate for the prediction of later asthma. In conclusion, after bronchiolitis in infancy, simple clinical non-invasive variables assessed at 2 years of age could predict asthma at 11 years of age with reasonable accuracy. However, the data were better suited to exclude than to predict later asthma. Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the association of ethnicity with objectively, electronically measured adherence to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in a multicultural population of children with asthma in the city of Amsterdam., METHODS: The study was designed as a prospective, observational multicenter study in which adherence to ICS and potential risk factors for adherence to ICS were measured in a cohort of Moroccan and native Dutch children with asthma. Electronic adherence measurements were performed for 3 months per patient using a Real Time Medication Monitoring (RTMM) system. Ethnicity and other potential risk factors, such as socio-economic status, asthma control and parental medication beliefs, were extracted from medical records or parent interviews. The association between adherence and ethnicity was analysed using multivariate linear regression analysis., RESULTS: A total of 90 children (aged 1-11 years) were included in the study and data of 87 children were used for analysis. Average adherence to ICS was 49.3 %. Native Dutch children showed higher adherence to ICS than Moroccan children (55.9 vs. 42.5 %, respectively; p = 0.044, univariate analysis). After correction for confounders (>3 annual visits to the paediatric outpatient clinic, regular use of a spacer during inhalation), the final regression model showed that ethnicity was independently associated with adherence (p = 0.028)., CONCLUSIONS: In our Western European population of inner city children with asthma, poor adherence to ICS was a serious problem, and even somewhat more so in ethnic minorities. Paediatricians involved in asthma treatment should be aware of these cultural differences in medication-taking behaviour, but further studies are needed to elucidate the causal mechanism.

N2  - Asthmatics hospitalised because of influenza A infection are less likely to require intensive care or die compared with nonasthmatics. The reasons for this are unknown. We performed a retrospective analysis of data on 1520 patients admitted to 75 UK hospitals with confirmed influenza A/H1N1 2009 infection. A multivariable model was used to investigate reasons for the association between asthma and severe outcomes (intensive care unit support or death). Asthmatics were less likely than nonasthmatics to have severe outcome (11.2% versus 19.8%, unadjusted OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.36-0.72) despite a greater proportion requiring oxygen on admission (36.4% versus 26%, unadjusted OR 1.63) and similar rates of pneumonia (17.1% versus 16.6%, unadjusted OR 1.04). The results of multivariable logistic regression suggest the association of asthma with outcome (adjusted OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.36-1.05; p=0.075) are explained by pre-admission inhaled corticosteroid use (adjusted OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.18-0.66) and earlier admission (<= 4 days from symptom onset) (adjusted OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38-0.94). In asthmatics, systemic corticosteroids were associated with a decreased likelihood of severe outcomes (adjusted OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.18-0.72). Corticosteroid use and earlier hospital admission explained the association of asthma with less severe outcomes in hospitalised patients.

N2  - An association between preterm birth and an increased risk of childhood asthma has been demonstrated, but the importance of intrauterine growth retardation on asthma risk is unclear. Using data from Swedish health registers, infant characteristics and childhood asthma were studied. Analyses were made using Mantel-Haenszel methodology with adjustment for year of birth, maternal age, parity, smoking in early pregnancy and maternal body mass index. Preterm birth, birth weight and birth weight for gestational week were analysed and childhood asthma was evaluated from prescriptions of anti-asthmatic drugs. Neonatal respiratory problems and treatment for them were studied as mediating factors. Both short gestational duration and intrauterine growth retardation appeared to be risk factors and seemed to act separately. The largest effect was seen from short gestational duration. Use of mechanical ventilation in the newborn period and bronchopulmonary dysplasia were strong risk factors. A moderately increased risk was also seen in infants born large for gestational age. We conclude that preterm birth is a stronger risk factor for childhood asthma than intrauterine growth disturbances; however, the latter also affects the risk, and is also seen in infants born at term.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence rate and risk factors for asthma in children from the Futian District of Shenzhen, China who were aged from 0-14 years between 2010 and 2011, and to provide scientific evidence for the prevention and treatment of childhood asthma., METHODS: A multistage stratified cluster sampling survey of 7168 children aged 0-14 years from the Futian District of Shenzhen was conducted using the Third National Childhood Asthma Epidemiological Questionnaire 2010, to investigate the prevalence rate of childhood asthma. A case-control study (1:1) and logistic regression analysis were used to investigate the risk factors for childhood asthma., RESULTS: Of the 7168 children surveyed, 169 were diagnosed with asthma, with a total prevalence rate of 2.36%. The prevalence rate was higher in males than in females (3.06% vs 1.55%, P<0.01). Of the 169 cases, 115 (68.1%) had their first asthma attack before the age of 3 years, 95 (56.2%) had moderate attacks, 159 (94.1%) had sudden attacks, 86 (50.9%) suffered from asthma during periods of seasonal change, 97 (57.4%) had attacks before going to bed, 157 (92.9%) suffered from asthma caused by respiratory infection, and 159 (94.1%) had sneezing as the sign of oncoming attack. The case-control study (including the 169 asthma cases and 169 healthy children) and logistic regression analysis both showed that the independent risk factors for asthma in children were a personal history of drug allergy (OR=3.431, 95%CI: 1.240-9.496, P=0.018), a history of food allergy (OR=4.043, 95%CI: 1.669-9.795, P= 0.002), allergic rhinitis (OR=9.686, 95%CI: 5.137-18.263, P<0.001), and a family history of allergy (OR=4.059, 95%CI: 2.054-8.018, P<0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence rate of asthma was 2.36% in children aged 0-14 years in the Futian District of Shenzhen between 2010 and 2011. The prevalence rate had not increased when compared with the rate in this region 10 years earlier (2.39%). The prevalence rate of childhood asthma is higher in males than in females. Personal history of drug allergy, food allergy, allergic rhinitis and a family history of allergy are the independent risk factors for childhood asthma in this region.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The use of biomarkers has expanded considerably, as an alternative to questionnaire-based metrics of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS); few studies have assessed the affect of such alternative metrics on diverse respiratory outcomes in children, and we aimed to do so., METHODS: We evaluated various measures of birth-year ETS, in association with multiple respiratory endpoints early years of life, in the novel context of a birth cohort at high risk for asthma. We administered questionnaires to parents, both at the end of pregnancy and at one year of life, and measured cotinine in cord blood (CCot; in 275 children) and in urine (UCot; obtained at 12 months in 365 children), each by radioimmunoassay. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the association of the various metrics with recurrent wheeze at age 2 and with bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) and asthma at age 7., RESULTS: Self-reported 3rd trimester maternal smoking was associated with significantly increased risk for recurrent wheeze at age 2 (odds ratio 3.5 [95% confidence interval = 1.2,10.7]); the risks associated with CCot and 3rd trimester smoking in any family member were similar (OR 2.9 [1.2,7.0] and 2.6 [1.0,6.5], respectively). No metric of maternal smoking at 12 months appeared to significantly influence the risk of recurrent wheeze at age 2, and no metric of ETS at any time appeared to significantly influence risk of asthma or BHR at age 7., CONCLUSIONS: Biomarker- and questionnaire-based assessment of ETS in early life lead to similar estimates of ETS-associated risk of recurrent wheeze and asthma.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Studies based on the ISAAC questionnaire suggest a correlation between the use of antibiotics and the prevalence of asthma and allergy in children aged 6-7 years. The number of courses of antibiotic therapy is an important factor., OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between the use of antibiotics during the first years of life and the prevalence of allergy and asthma among children (aged 6-8 years) in the urban population of Poland., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey-based study with a self-completed questionnaire. The respondents were parents of children aged 6-8 years living in Warszawa, Poland. 1461 completed questionnaires were collected., RESULTS: Asthma was declared in 4.3% of the children. Wheezing and/or sibilant rhonchi within 12 months before the study was observed in 13.5% of the cases. Asthma medication was taken by 21.8% of the children. Allergic rhinitis was declared in 18.7% of the children. Problems with sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion not associated with cold or fever were observed in 40.7% of the children. The analysis of the odds ratios between the use of antibiotics and the symptoms of allergic diseases revealed a clear correlation. The highest odds ratio was observed between the completion of over three courses of antibiotic therapy prior to the age of 12 months and the declaration of one of the following: asthma (OR = 5.59, 95% CI: 2.6-12.01), wheezing and/or sibilant rhonchi (OR = 4.68, 95% CI: 3.01-7.27) and taking medicines for breathlessness (OR = 5.12, 95% CI: 3.42-7.68)., CONCLUSIONS: There is a direct relationship between antibiotic use in the first 3 years of life and asthma and allergy symptoms in children aged 6-8 years old.

N2  - The objective of the evidence-based guidelines 'Asthma in children (ages 0-19)' for youth healthcare (CHC) is the prevention and reduction of asthma symptoms. The guidelines contain a lot of recommendations that apply to all disciplines in healthcare that deal with children. Primary prevention (preventing asthma): the main proven effective intervention is no smoking, neither passive nor active. Breastfeeding has a small protective effect. Starting at the first home visit at two weeks, the CHC nurse advises no smoking and to breastfeed. Secondary prevention (early detection): at all routine check-ups, the professional at CHC should inquire about signs of dyspnoea and wheezing. Patients suspected of having asthma should be referred to the GP. Tertiary prevention (reducing symptoms in children with asthma): the main advice is no smoking (neither passive nor active) and to follow the advice of the treating physician.

N2  - Asthma is a complex condition where genetic and environmental interactions occur at critical periods in development. The focus of this review was the role of environmental exposures on asthma causation. Selected studies published in 2010 and 2011 were reviewed to illustrate the challenge in relating environmental exposure(s) on asthma causation and also to focus on some exposures currently thought to be important to asthma pathogenesis. Challenges in understanding how environmental exposures may translate into asthma causation are summarised. Inhaled and ingested exposures are described, including microbial products, swimming pools, diet and antenatal tobacco exposure. A final synthesis summarises what is currently understood about childhood asthma causation and what advice might be given to parents and governments interested in reducing asthma risk.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In well-child care it is difficult to determine whether preschool children with asthma symptoms actually have or will develop asthma at school age. The PIAMA (Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy) Risk Score has been proposed as an instrument that predicts asthma at school age, using eight easy obtainable parameters, assessed at the time of first asthma symptoms at preschool age. The aim of this study is to present the rationale and design of a study 1) to externally validate and update the PIAMA Risk Score, 2) to develop an Asthma Risk Appraisal Tool to predict asthma at school age in (specific subgroups of) preschool children with asthma symptoms and 3) to test implementation of the Asthma Risk Appraisal Tool in well-child care., METHODS AND DESIGN: The study will be performed within the framework of Generation R, a prospective multi-ethnic cohort study. In total, consent for postnatal follow-up was obtained from 7893 children, born between 2002 and 2006. At preschool age the PIAMA Risk Score will be assessed and used to predict asthma at school age. Discrimination (C-index) and calibration will be assessed for the external validation. We will study whether the predictive ability of the PIAMA Risk Score can be improved by removing or adding predictors (e.g. preterm birth). The (updated) PIAMA Risk Score will be converted to the Asthma Risk Appraisal Tool- to predict asthma at school age in preschool children with asthma symptoms. Additionally, we will conduct a pilot study to test implementation of the Asthma Risk Appraisal Tool in well-child care., DISCUSSION: Application of the Asthma Risk Appraisal Tool in well-child care will help to distinguish preschool children at high- and low-risk of developing asthma at school age when asthma symptoms appear.This study will increase knowledge about the validity of the PIAMA risk score and might improve risk assessment of developing asthma at school age in (specific subgroups of) preschool children, who present with asthma symptoms at well-child care.

N2  - Allergies are multifactorial diseases the onset of which depends also on genetic and environmental factors in early life. Thus, environmental factors can affect the immune response and modify lung development, thereby leading to asthma. The role of the factors used to date to predict asthma development is modest, and clinical criteria should always be considered in association with familiarity for atopy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the risk of asthma in a population with positive skin prick test (SPT) (which is a reliable marker of atopy) to food allergens, regardless of clinical manifestations in the early years of life. The cohort of children enrolled in our study who had a positive SPT to food in the first three years of life had a prevalence of asthma after 7-14 years, double that of the general pediatric population. This prevalence increased significantly in patients with SPT positivity for food and inhalant allergens. We identified a correlation between the sensitization profile in children under the age of 36 months and the development of asthma during a period of 7-14 years. This study confirms that early sensitization is an important risk factor for the development of asthma, particularly in association with sensitization to inhalants, and that the persistence of food sensitization in school-age children and adolescents is associated to more severe asthma.

N2  - Variation in exposure to polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) might influence the development of atopy, asthma, and wheeze. This study aimed to determine whether differences in PUFA concentrations in maternal plasma phosphatidylcholine are associated with the risk of childhood wheeze or atopy. For 865 term-born children, we measured phosphatidylcholine fatty acid composition in maternal plasma collected at 34 weeks' gestation. Wheezing was classified using questionnaires at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months and 6 years. At age of 6 years, the children underwent skin prick testing, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) measurement, and spirometry. Maternal n-6 fatty acids and the ratio of n-3 to n-6 fatty acids were not associated with childhood wheeze. However, higher maternal eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and total n-3 fatty acids were associated with reduced risk of non-atopic persistent/late wheeze (RR 0.57, 0.67 and 0.69, resp. P = 0.01, 0.015, and 0.021, resp.). Maternal arachidonic acid was positively associated with FENO (P = 0.024). A higher ratio of linoleic acid to its unsaturated metabolic products was associated with reduced risk of skin sensitisation (RR 0.82, P = 0.013). These associations provide some support for the hypothesis that variation in exposure to n-6 and n-3 fatty acids during pregnancy influences the risk of childhood wheeze and atopy.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Few recent estimates of childhood asthma incidence exist in the literature, although the importance of incidence surveillance for understanding asthma risk factors has been recognized. Asthma prevalence, morbidity, and mortality reports have repeatedly shown that low-income children are disproportionately impacted by the disease. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the utility of Medicaid claims data for providing statewide estimates of asthma incidence. Medicaid analytic extract (MAX) data for Texas children aged 0-17 years enrolled in Medicaid between 2004 and 2007 were used to estimate incidence overall and by age group, gender, race, and county of residence. A >=13-month period of continuous enrollment was required in order to distinguish incident from prevalent cases identified in the claims data. The age-adjusted incidence of asthma was 4.26/100 person-years during 2005-2007, higher than reported in other populations. Incidence rates decreased with age, were higher for males than females, differed by race, and tended to be higher in rural than urban areas. This study demonstrates the utility of Medicaid analytic extract data for estimating asthma incidence and describes the methodology required for a population with unstable enrollment.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The atopic march hypothesis proposes that eczema precedes the development of asthma and allergic rhinitis., OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the evidence for a causal effect of infantile eczema on childhood hay fever, asthma, or both., METHODS: We used parental reports on infantile eczema and childhood asthma and hay fever for 3778 pairs of 7-year-olds matched to their sibling closest in age within 2 years from the Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study. We analyzed paired sibling data using a logistic regression model that allowed inference about a causal effect of a familial predictor on a child's outcome by examining the change in association with their cosibling's predictor after adjusting for their own predictor status., RESULTS: Siblings were concordant for infantile eczema (tetrachoric correlation, 0.40). For having both hay fever and asthma by age 7 years, the association with cosibling's eczema was an odds ratio (OR) of 1.98 (95% CI, 1.37-2.86), which reduced after adjusting for own eczema to an OR of 1.65 (95% CI, 1.17-2.34). For having hay fever only, the association with cosibling's eczema was an OR of 1.68 (95% CI, 1.22-2.31) before and an OR of 1.59 (95% CI, 1.19-2.14) after adjusting for own eczema. There was no association between having asthma only and cosibling's eczema (OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.77-1.30)., CONCLUSIONS: Eczema in infancy might have a causal effect on hay fever in children with and perhaps without asthma. The association of infantile eczema on asthma in children without hay fever, which might be early transient wheeze, is unlikely to be causal or familial. These findings have implications for hay fever prevention. Copyright © 2012 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Published by Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

T1  - Otitis media in infancy and the development of asthma and atopic disease.
A1  - MacIntyre, Elaina A

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Otitis media is a frequent respiratory infection of early childhood and it is important to fully understand the long-term complications and sequelae. Literature examining otitis media in early childhood and subsequent development of atopic disease is sparse despite there being vast literature on the association between respiratory infections and atopic disease. Current data support the hypothesis that otitis media infections in early life, especially frequent or severe infections, influence the developing immune system, resulting in increased risk for asthma. Recent findings have also reported an association between otitis media and eczema. Atopic children and those with a family history of atopy appear to be at greater risk. Future work should investigate the specific mechanisms involved. It is possible that vaccines and preventive strategies aimed at reducing the burden of otitis media could also reduce the burden of childhood asthma and atopic disease.

N2  - To assess the associations between a doctor diagnosis of asthma and wheezing (independent of a diagnosis of asthma) with sickle cell disease (SCD) morbidity, we conducted a retrospective review of Emergency Department (ED) visits to the Mount Sinai Medical Center for SCD between 1 January 2007 and 1 January 2011. Outcomes were ED visits for pain and acute chest syndrome. The cohort included 262 individuals, median age 23.8 years, (range: 6 months to 67.5 years). At least one episode of wheezing recorded on a physical examination was present in 18.7% (49 of 262). Asthma and wheezing did not overlap completely, 53.1% of patients with wheezing did not carry a diagnosis of asthma. Wheezing was associated with a 118% increase in ED visits for pain (95% confidence interval [CI]: 56-205%) and a 158% increase in ED visits for acute chest syndrome (95% CI: 11-498%). A diagnosis of asthma was associated with a 44% increase in ED utilization for pain (95% CI: 2-104%) and no increase in ED utilization for acute chest syndrome (rate ratio 1.00, 95%CI 0.41-2.47). In conclusion, asthma and wheezing are independent risk factors for increased painful episodes in individuals with SCD. Only wheezing was associated with more acute chest syndrome.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The association between neonatal jaundice and childhood asthma is a new finding of two reports. The purpose of the study was to verify their results., METHODS: Data from 11,321 children were collected from the National Health Insurance Research Database. Their claims data were evaluated from birth to 10 yr old. Children were analyzed as case (those with neonatal jaundice) and controls (those without neonatal jaundice). The diagnostic criteria for asthma were as follows: at least four asthma diagnoses at outpatient services and emergency department (ED), or one asthma diagnosis during an admission. In children fitting the asthma criteria, those with no asthma diagnosis after 1 yr of age were excluded. Mantel-Haenszel's odds ratios were calculated after adjustment for the following confounders: preterm/low birth weight, neonatal infection, other respiratory conditions, other birth conditions, and gender. Asthma rate, onset time, the use of drugs, upper respiratory infection and lower respiratory infection (LRI) rates, hospital admission/ED visit rates, and the effect of phototherapy were evaluated., RESULTS: After adjustment for the confounding factors, the rate of asthma was higher in icteric children (OR: 1.64, 95% CI 1.36-1.98, p < 0.001), and the influence in females was stronger. There still was an association between neonatal jaundice and late onset asthma (asthma onset after 3 yr of age). In asthmatic children, those with neonatal jaundice have increased asthma onset rate before age 6, increased use of inhalant steroids, LRI rates, and ED visits for respiratory disease., CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal jaundice increased the rate and severity of childhood asthma in subjects aged up to 10 yr and may be a risk factor for childhood asthma.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The literature is contradictory concerning pet exposure and risk of allergic disease in childhood especially among those with a family history of allergy., OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between cat and dog exposure at birth and allergic outcomes over the first 12 years in a birth cohort selected for familial allergy., METHODS: A prospective birth cohort of 620 infants with a family history of allergic diseases was recruited. Data on pet keeping, family demographics and cord blood samples were collected at birth. Information on childhood wheeze, eczema and hay fever was collected 18 times in the first 2 years, at 7 years and at 12 years. Skin prick tests were conducted at 2, 7 and 12 years, and in parents. Regression analyses were used to investigate the relevant associations while adjusting for potential confounders., RESULTS: Exposure to cats or dogs at birth showed a moderate reduction in risk of wheeze (aOR = 0.76; 95% CI 0.53, 1.09) and hay fever (aOR = 0.71; 0.49, 1.02) after 7 years of age. Protective effects were stronger in children of non-sensitized fathers (aOR wheeze 0.55; 0.31, 0.98; aOR hay fever 0.33; 0.15, 0.77 on exposure to cats alone, or cats or dogs at birth). Pet keeping was not related to cord blood IgE or sensitization from 2 to 12 years., CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Pets at birth either decreased or had no effect on allergic disease up to age 12. We found no evidence that exposure to cats or dogs at birth increases the risk of allergic disease in high-risk children. Copyright © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Asthma is the most common chronic respiratory disease seriously endangering the health of children. But disease awareness and self-management skills are relatively poor in children; parents play an important role in the control of childhood asthma., OBJECTIVE: To investigate the status of asthma control and severity of asthma in children and to identify impact factors., METHODS: We studied 1 tertiary hospital in each of the 29 provinces. A total of 2,960 parents with children with asthma who visited those hospitals were selected for the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) questionnaire survey, and separated into the controlled asthma group and uncontrolled asthma group according to children's asthma conditions in the past 12 months. Multivariate analysis was carried out based on the answers to 28 tested factors., RESULTS: In the past 12 months, 66.0% of children with asthma had asthma attacks, 26.8% visited an emergency room, and 16.2% were hospitalized. The total cost for asthma was significantly higher in the uncontrolled group than controlled group (chi(2) = 23.14, P < .01). Twelve protective factors of asthma control were founded, such as older age of children, long disease course, high KAP scores of parents, compliance with using nasal steroids, and knowledge of "3 or more times recurrent wheezing suggesting asthma." The risk factors were eczema and family history of asthma., CONCLUSION: Children's asthma is poorly controlled. The cost of asthma is significantly higher in uncontrolled asthma than in controlled. The age of children, course of asthma, personal history of allergy, family history of asthma, parents' education level, and parents' KAP are factors that affect asthma control.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate risk influencing factors of asthma for children in Suzhou City, China., METHODS: A survey of asthma was conducted on children aged 0 - 14 with or without asthma from September 2010 to April 2011 in Pingjiang district of Suzhou city. A total of 271 children diagnosed with asthma were considered as a case group, and 271 non-asthmatic children with the same age, sex and living region formed the control group. Risk factors were analyzed with chi(2) test and logistic regression analysis., RESULTS: All children were Han. The case group was composed of 165 boys and 106 girls, so was the case group. The average age was (7.5 +/- 2.3) years for the case group and (7.8 +/- 2.9) years for the control group, which did not showed any significant difference (P > 0.05). Family history of allergy (OR = 10.624, 95%CI: 6.294 - 18.623), history of children's eczema (OR = 4.403, 95%CI: 8.627 - 29.632), history of allergic rhinitis (OR = 6.871, 95%CI: 7.658 - 31.871), passive smoking when baby was born (OR = 3.323, 95%CI: 3.541 - 11.634), mold contamination (OR = 1.837, 95%CI: 1.531 - 4.926) were the risk factors, and breast-feeding (OR = 0.513, 95%CI: 0.418 - 0.914) was the protective factor., CONCLUSION: Family history of allergy, history of children's eczema, history of allergic rhinitis, passive smoking, and old contamination are the risk factors, and breast-feeding is the protective factor.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Asthma is a chronic disease that often starts in childhood. The key risk factors are a child's environment and their genetic characteristics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of environmental modification in the first 12 months of life on the prevalence of asthma in high-risk individuals., METHODS: Children (n=120) considered at high risk of allergic disorders (either dual heredity or single heredity and a high cord total IgE), were enrolled in a single-blinded, randomised controlled trial. Infants in the intervention arm were either breast fed with the mother on a low allergen diet or given an extensively hydrolysed formula. Exposure to house dust mite allergen was reduced. The control group followed standard advice. Children were assessed at ages 1, 2, 4, 8 and 18 years for the presence of asthma and atopy., RESULTS: At 18 years of age, there was a significantly lower prevalence of asthma in the prevention group compared with the control group (OR: 0.23, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.70, p=0.01), primarily due to asthma that developed during childhood but persisted until age 18 years. Repeated-measure analysis showed that there was an overall reduction in asthma prevalence from 1 to 18 years (OR: 0.51, CI 0.32 to 0.81, p=0.04). Prevalence of atopy was not significantly different between the two groups at age 18., CONCLUSION: Comprehensive allergen avoidance in the first year of life is effective in preventing asthma onset in individuals considered at high risk due to heredity. The effect occurs in the early years, but persists through to adulthood.

T1  - Anaphylaxis in children: current understanding and key issues in diagnosis and treatment.
A1  - Dinakar, Chitra
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. Since it is unpredictable and potentially fatal, prompt recognition and treatment are vital to maximize a positive outcome. The occurrence of anaphylaxis is increasing across all ages in the United States, with increased risk of worse outcome in teenagers/young adults and in those with comorbid conditions such as asthma. Gaps in the assessment of patient-specific risk factors, identification and prevention of triggers, recognition of signs/symptoms, and pharmacologic treatment of anaphylaxis have been identified at the physician and caregiver/patient level. A PubMed literature search (January 2000-December 2011) was conducted to identify publications on childhood anaphylaxis using the following terms: food allergy, food allergens, food hypersensitivity, epinephrine, epinephrine auto-injectors, anaphylactic triggers, and anaphylaxis. This review will critically appraise these key issues and highlight strategies that might result in improved management of anaphylaxis in children.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of asthma in young children is difficult and based on clinical assessment of symptoms and results of physical examination. Respiratory wheeze has traditionally been used to define asthma in young children., OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare the qualitative diagnosis of wheeze with a quantitative global assessment of significant troublesome lung symptoms during the first 3 years of life as a predictor of asthma by age 7 years., METHODS: Children born to asthmatic mothers (n= 411) were followed prospectively to age 7 years. Parents were instructed to visit the research clinic during the first 3 years of life each time the child had significant troublesome lung symptoms for 3 days. At the clinic, a research physician performed a physical examination, including auscultation for wheeze and excluding differential diagnoses. We tested whether wheeze was independently associated with asthma at age 7 years after adjusting for the total number of episodes., RESULTS: Three hundred thirteen children had full follow-up by age 7 years. In a multivariable analysis the total number of acute clinic visits for asthma symptom was significantly associated with later asthma (P< .0001), whereas the presence of wheeze at these visits was not (P= .5). The total number of acute clinic visits for significant troublesome lung symptoms was also significantly associated with later asthma in children who had never presented with any wheeze (P= .03)., CONCLUSION: A quantitative global assessment of significant troublesome lung symptoms in the first 3 years of life is a better predictor of asthma than assessment of wheeze. Doctor-diagnosed wheeze is not a prerequisite for the diagnosis of asthma, and relying on the symptom of wheeze will likely be an important cause of undertreatment.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Studies exploring the relationship between prenatal vitamin D exposure and childhood asthma have yielded conflicting results. Higher vitamin D intake during pregnancy has been shown to lower the risk of childhood wheeze, yet a study of maternal late-pregnancy serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D suggested higher serum concentrations may be associated with increased childhood asthma., OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between mothers' serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D status and asthma and wheeze phenotypes in their children at age 6 years. Also to explore the relationship between maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D status and objective measures of childhood atopy and lung function., METHODS: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was measured at 34 weeks' gestation in the mothers of 860 children born at term. Wheeze was classified as either transient or persistent/late using questionnaire data collated from 6, 12, 24 and 36 months and 6 years. At 6 years spirometry was performed and atopic status was determined by skin prick testing, exhaled nitric oxide was measured in 451 children and bronchial hyperresponsiveness in 216 children., RESULTS: There were no significant associations between maternal late-pregnancy 25-hydroxyvitamin D status and either asthma or wheeze at age 6 years. Maternal vitamin D status was not associated with transient or persistent/late wheeze; no significant association was found between persistent/late wheeze when subdivided according to atopic status. No associations were found with skin sensitisation or lung function., CONCLUSIONS: This study provides no evidence that exposure to higher concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in maternal serum during late pregnancy increases the risk of childhood asthma, wheeze or atopy.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the risk factors for persistent asthma among common environmental exposures, like ambient air pollutants and second hand smoke, animals, place of residence, decreased ventilation, dust, as well as history of allergic conditions like rhinitis, dermatitis and family history of asthma in children., METHODS: This hospital-based, cross-sectional study was conducted after institutional ethical clearance. Children aged 1-12 y with asthma were recruited after parental consent. Children were classified into asthma severity categories according to GINA 2002 and level of control categories according to GINA 2009 guidelines. Adjusted logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with persistent asthma., RESULTS: From August 2008 through October 2010, 205 asthmatic children were recruited of which 73 (35.60 %) had intermittent and 132 (64.40 %) had persistent asthma. Asthma was controlled in 19 (9.26 %), partly controlled in 90 (43.90 %) and uncontrolled in 96 (46.82 %). Patients with persistent asthma were more likely to have uncontrolled asthma (OR = 8.28; 95 % CI: 2.43-31.01; p < 0.001). Adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status and place of residence, persistent asthma was associated with residence within 1.5 km from heavy traffic (OR = 4.58; 95%CI: 2.18-9.59; p < 0.001) and father smoking indoors >5 cigarettes or "bidi"/day (OR = 17.76; 95 % CI: 1.85-170.76; p = 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: Since patients with persistent asthma are more likely to have uncontrolled asthma and since persistent asthma is associated with residence closer to heavy traffic and exposure to second hand smoke, minimizing exposures to these may help in better asthma control.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have demonstrated an association between the exposure to indoor air pollution (IAP) and childhood asthma. Evidence is suggesting that several air pollutants may contribute to both exacerbation and development of asthma, but some uncertainty remains concerning the specific causative role of IAP. This paper reports an epidemiologic study aiming to reduce the existing lacks on the association between long-term exposure to pollution mixtures and the development and exacerbation of childhood asthma., METHODS/DESIGN: Based on the implementation of the study in 8 nurseries and 8 primary schools, from which, 2 nurseries and 2 primary schools in sites influenced by traffic and other 2 nurseries and 2 primary schools in background sites at urban and rural areas, the study will analyse the exposure to both urban and rural pollution as well as to traffic emissions (some homes of the children will be included in the study). Furthermore, based on the answers to validated questionnaires (as those used in the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood - ISAAC) filled in by the parents and on medical exams, the study will assess the prevalence, incidence and exacerbation of asthma, thus considering both short and long-term effects. The approximate number of children in the study will never be less than 600, guaranteeing 80% of study power (significant at a 5% level)., DISCUSSION: This study intends to contribute for the understanding of the role of environmental factors, namely indoor air pollution, on asthma considering a risk group of different ages, and for the development of preventive measures, which are considered priority issues by the European Commission, according to the European Environmental Agency and the World Health Organization.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Associations of emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions for asthma in children with demographics and area socio-economic status (SES) were examined to evaluate long-term trends and identify vulnerable populations., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective population-based trend and cross-sectional analyses., METHODS: Asthma hospital admissions (2000-2007) and ED visits (2005-2007) for children aged 0-14 years living in Orange County, California were linked with zip-code-level SES data (2000 US Census). Annual population estimates were obtained to calculate age-specific admissions and ED visit rates. Average annual percentage changes (AAPC) were calculated with joinpoint analyses. The risks of ED visits and hospital admissions were estimated from SES indicators with negative binomial regression., RESULTS: Rates of asthma hospital admissions and ED visits were highest among children aged 0-4 years, males and African Americans, and lowest among Asian/Pacific Islanders. African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos were more likely to be uninsured. Asthma admissions decreased significantly for all age groups over the study period. The greatest declines per 100,000 were among children aged 0-4 years (AAPC: -15.3%, 95% confidence interval -17.0% to -13.4%). Rates of hospital admissions and ED visits were significantly higher in low-SES groups. Hospital admission rates were 30-60% higher and ED visits were 80-90% higher in zip codes in the lowest tertile of median household income compared with the highest tertile of median household income., CONCLUSIONS: Paediatric asthma hospitalizations and ED visit rates are declining in Orange County. However, certain groups are disproportionately affected, including those living in areas with low SES. This information will help in targeting intervention strategies to children at highest risk for severe asthma episodes. Copyright © 2012 The Royal Society for Public Health.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Damp and mould in homes have been established as risk factors for respiratory health. There is a need for a relatively straightforward assessment of the home that quantifies this risk., METHODS: Using data from 891 New Zealand houses, the utility of a Respiratory Hazard Index quantifying key attributes related to damp and mould was tested by studying its associations with self-reported respiratory symptoms., RESULTS: A dose-response relationship was found whereby each unit increase in the Respiratory Hazard Index was associated with an 11% increase in the odds of at least one episode of wheezing/whistling in the chest over the last 12 months (relative odds of 1.11 with a 95% CI 1.04%-1.20%). An 11% increase in the odds of an asthma attack over the last 12 months was estimated (relative odds of 1.11 with a 95% CI 1.01%-1.22%). These estimates were adjusted for household crowding levels, age, sex and smoking status. There was suggestive evidence of more steeply increasing odds of respiratory symptoms with increasing levels of the Respiratory Hazard Index for children aged under 7. In the worst performing houses according to the Index, a 33% reduction in the number of people experiencing respiratory symptoms (relative risk 0.67 with 95% CI 0.53 to 0.85) could be expected if people were housed in the best performing houses., CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that increased evidence of housing conditions supporting dampness and mould was associated with increased odds of respiratory symptoms. A valid housing assessment tool can provide a rational basis for investment in improved housing quality to improve respiratory health.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Exposure to traffic-related air pollutants plays a role in several health outcomes. A large body of evidence tends to link asthma in children with traffic exposure. Increasing asthma prevalence and incidence in children in Canadian cities has been of concern for public health authorities. The following study focuses on estimating the risk of asthma prevalence attributable to residing in proximity to major roads on the Island of Montreal, Canada., METHODS: Risk functions pertaining to asthma in children and residential proximity to major roads were selected from the literature and applied to Montreal. Asthma prevalence was taken from population-based studies. Population data were retrieved from Canadian census. Exposure was estimated using the proximity to major road and highway category of the Desktop Mapping Technologies Inc. database (DMTI Spatial Inc.)., RESULTS: Based on different studies, the percentage of prevalent asthma cases attributable to residing within 50 metres of a major road or highway for children aged 2, 4 and 6 years varied between 2.4% (0-4.3), 5.6% (0.1-8.6) and 5.9% (0.1-9.0). For the 5-7 year age group residing within 75 m of a major road or highway, the percent of cases was 6.4% (2.6-9.3). For children aged 8 to 10 residing within 75 m of a highway only, the percent of cases was 0.7% (0.2-0.9)., CONCLUSION: These numbers represent the best crude estimates and are an indication of a possible range of cases linked to residential proximity to major roads. As there are uncertainties linked to the application of exposure-response functions, these estimates will be reassessed as new evidence is gathered through further research.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a component of innate immunity and has been linked with the pathogenesis of asthma. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association of MBL genotypes with preschool asthma and allergy in children with bronchiolitis in early infancy., METHODS: In all, 205 infants were hospitalized for bronchiolitis at <6 months of age. Asthma and allergy were studied from a total of 166 children at 6.4 years (mean). A total of 141 (85%) frozen whole blood samples were available for MBL genotyping and MBL2 gene mutations were determined on pyrosequencing for detection of three single-nucleotide polymorphisms., RESULTS: Ninety-five children (67.4%) had the wild-type MBL genotype A/A and 46 had A/O or O/O genotypes. Asthma was present in 16 children (11.3%) at 5-7 years of age. Nine children (19.6%) with non-AA genotype had asthma (vs 7.4% of those with genotype AA, P= 0.03). The result remained significant after adjustment for age, gender and atopy. There were no significant associations between MBL genotypes and asthma at any age before the study. Atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis or paternal and/or maternal asthma had no significant associations with MBL genotypes., CONCLUSIONS: The variant non-A/A MBL genotype is associated with asthma after bronchiolitis in infancy, but not earlier than at 5-7 years of age.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The development of asthma after respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis has been demonstrated in case-control studies, although the determinants of post-RSV asthma remain undefined., OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate the potential determinants of physician-diagnosed asthma after severe RSV bronchiolitis during infancy., METHODS: We enrolled 206 children during an initial episode of severe RSV bronchiolitis at 12 months of age or less in a prospective cohort study and followed these children for up to 6 years. In a subset of 81 children, we analyzed CCL5 (RANTES) mRNA expression in upper airway epithelial cells., RESULTS: Forty-eight percent of children had physician-diagnosed asthma before the seventh birthday. Independent determinants significantly associated with increased risk for physician-diagnosed asthma by the seventh birthday included maternal asthma (odds ratio [OR], 5.2; 95% CI, 1.7-15.9; P = .004), exposure to high levels of dog allergen (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.3-7.7; P = .012), aeroallergen sensitivity at age 3 years (OR, 10.7; 95% CI, 2.1-55.0; P = .005), recurrent wheezing during the first 3 years of life (OR, 7.3; 95% CI, 1.2-43.3; P = .028), and CCL5 expression in nasal epithelia during acute RSV infection (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.4; P < .001). White children (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.04-0.93; P = .041) and children attending day care (OR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.04-0.84; P = .029) had a decreased risk of physician-diagnosed asthma., CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 50% of children who experience severe RSV bronchiolitis have a subsequent asthma diagnosis. The presence of increased CCL5 levels in nasal epithelia at the time of bronchiolitis or the development of allergic sensitization by age 3 years are associated with increased likelihood of subsequent asthma.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may activate the immune system and cause asthma., AIM: To investigate the association of prenatal exposure to PPIs and histamine 2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) with risk of asthma., METHODS: In this cohort study, 197,060 singletons born between 1996 and 2008 in northern Denmark were followed until the end of 2009. Data were obtained through Danish medical registries. Asthma in offspring was defined as at least two prescriptions of both a beta-agonist and an inhaled glucocorticoid and/or a hospital diagnosis of asthma during the follow-up. Cox proportional-hazard regression was used to compute incidence rate ratios, adjusting for covariates., RESULTS: A total of 2238 (1.1%) children were prenatally exposed to PPIs and 24,506 (12.4%) children developed asthma during follow-up (median follow-up = 6.8 years). The adjusted IRR (aIRR) of asthma associated with prenatal exposure to PPIs was 1.41 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.27-1.56), compared with those unexposed. The association did not vary by trimester of exposure, and prenatal exposure to H2RAs was associated with similar increase in risk. The aIRR for maternal PPI and H2RA use in the year after, but not during pregnancy was 1.32 (95% CI: 1.20-1.46) and 1.13 (0.93-1.36), respectively, compared with non-use during and in the year after pregnancy., CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal exposure to both PPIs and H2RAs was associated with an increased risk of asthma in our study. Because the observed association is not drug specific and also observed for maternal postnatal use it may be explained by a 'class effect' or maternal underlying condition.

N2  - Maltese children are frequently exposed to tobacco smoke through passive and personal smoking. In the phase 3 ISAAC study questionnaire, we enquired about passive smoking to the parents of 3816 (80% response rate) 5- to 8-yr-old children and about passive and personal smoking to 4139 (90% response rate) 13- to 15-yr-old participating children. Thirty-one percent of 5- to 8-yr olds were passive smokers with their father more likely to be the smoker (p < 0.0001). Maternal smoking in the first year of the child's life resulted in the children having an increased chance of wheezing 'ever' (p < 0.001), exercise-induced wheezing (p < 0.05) and being diagnosed with asthma (p < 0.0001). Current smoking by the mother also led to the child having current rhinitis (p < 0.001). Fifty-one percent of 13- to 15-yr olds were passive smokers again with the father more likely to be the smoker (p < 0.0001). Maternal (p < 0.0001) and paternal smoking (p < 0.05) resulted in the children having an increased chance of wheezing sometime in their life, exercise-induced wheezing, nocturnal cough, and being diagnosed with asthma. Current smoking by the mother was more common in children having current rhinitis (p < 0.05), while current smoking by both mother and/or father led to itchy/watery eyes accompanying rhinitis (p < 0.05). Recurrent itchy rashes were also more likely in passive smokers (p < 0.001). Personal smoking by the 13- to 15-yr olds (8.15% boys vs. 8.8% girls ns ) resulted in a higher cumulative prevalence of wheezing (p < 0.0001), rhinitis (p < 0.05), and recurrent itchy rash (p < 0.001) but only affected current prevalence of wheezing (p < 0.0001). These smokers were more likely to experience exercise-induced wheezing (p < 0.0001), nocturnal cough (p < 0.0001), and being diagnosed with asthma (p < 0.05) and eczema (p < 0.001). Children smoking more than 10 cigarettes/day persisted with wheezing (p = 0.04) had more frequent episodes of exercise-induced wheeze (p = 0.04), nocturnal cough (p < 0.0001), and rhinoconjunctivitis (p = 0.02) than milder smokers. Smoking seems to be affecting childhood allergies in Maltese children quite significantly. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

N2  - Asthma is one of the most common chronic inflammatory disorders in children. Nonadherence to medical therapy is a major cause of poor clinical outcome the objective of this study was evaluating factors, which are resulted in nonadherence to medical therapy in children with asthma.In this descriptive study, 150 children with asthma and nonadherent to medication therapy were enrolled. General information and probable causes of nonadherence were recorded in self-report questionnaire and data were analyzed. In our study, 57.3% of children were male. Approximately 43%of children belonged to age group 6-9 years old. Prevalence of probable causes of nonadherence to treatment were concern about treatment expenses(34.7%) ,fear of cardiac complications(34.7%), concern about drug dependency(38.7%), belief to growth inhibition(30.7%) and fear of osteopenia (32%). There was statistically significant reverse association between treatment with multi-drug regimens and concern about bone mineral abnormalities, cardiac complications and drug dependency (p=0.0001, 0.014 and 0.012 respectively). In addition, there was a significant association between mild asthma and fear about drug dependency (p=0.001).According to our results, factors such as prolonged duration of treatment, various therapeutic regimens, and receiving multiple drugs before diagnosis of asthma pose the highest frequencies for nonadherence.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - The definition of persistent asthma in longitudinal studies reflects symptoms reported at every assessment with no substantive asymptomatic periods. Early-childhood wheezing may be transient, especially if it is of viral etiology. Longitudinal studies provide greater opportunity to confirm the diagnosis by variability of symptoms, objective measurements, and therapeutic responses. Several clinical phenotypes of childhood asthma have been identified, with general consistency between cohorts. Persistent wheezing is often associated with loss of lung function, which is evident from early-childhood and related to persistent inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. Female sex, atopy, airway responsiveness, and personal smoking, but not exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, are risk factors for persistence of childhood asthma into adulthood. The effect of breastfeeding remains controversial, but gene-environment interactions may partly explain outcomes. Understanding the natural history and underlying causes of asthma may lead to development of strategies for primary prevention.

N2  - In this study, associations between current asthma and possible determinants were studied using data of the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents ("Studie zur Gesundheit von Kindern und Jugendlichen in Deutschland," KiGGS). In this nationwide cross-sectional survey, 17,461 subjects aged 0-17 years were examined between 2003 and 2006. Data collection included a medical examination of the child, an interview of the parents, and written questionnaires. Apart from prevalence estimates, multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Increasing age and male sex, previous atopic diseases of the child, a positive family history of allergic diseases and low birth weight were significant risk factors of asthma, as were overweight and moldy walls in the residence. Breast feeding was not associated with a reduced risk of asthma. Low age at delivery of the mother and living in rural or provincial regions were shown to be protected. Overall, this study suggests that allergies of the parents and previous atopic disease of the child are the strongest determinants of asthma. However, environmental factors (mold on walls, living in rural and provincial towns) and lifestyle factors could also modify asthma risk.

T1  - Asthma and risk of brain cancer in children.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - PURPOSE: Little is known about the causes of central nervous system tumors in children. An inverse association between asthma and brain cancer was found in adults, but there is a dearth of studies in children. The goal of this study was to evaluate the association between asthma and brain cancer in children., METHODS: Two hundred and seventy-two cases of children with brain tumor diagnosed between 0 and 14 years of age in the Province of Quebec, Canada, between 1980 and 1999 and 272 incidence density-matched controls were included in the study. The parents of cases and controls were interviewed by phone using structured questionnaires. Besides asthma in children, family history of asthma, the presence of other atopies, and medication intake were also investigated. Conditional logistic regression was used to analyze the data., RESULTS: Brain tumor risk was decreased in children with asthma (OR, 0.55; CI 95%, 0.33-0.93), with eczema (OR, 0.52; CI 95%, 0.17-1.57), and with both asthma and eczema (OR, 0.76; CI 95%, 0.18-3.2). Maternal or sibling asthma did not modify the effect of asthma on central nervous system (CNS) tumors, while father's asthma seemed to increase the risk, but numbers were small. Antiasthma medications such as inhaled corticosteroid and beta agonists seemed to increase the risk of CNS tumors (OR for steroids, 2.55; CI 95%, 0.79-8.20 and OR for inhaled beta agonist, 1.62; CI 95%, 0.57-4.63)., CONCLUSIONS: This study strengthens the hypothesis of inverse association between asthma and brain cancer in children, but family history and medications for asthma need further investigation.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Severe acute asthma in children is associated with substantial morbidity and may require pediatric ICU (PICU) admission. The aim of the study was to determine risk factors for PICU admission., METHODS: The study used a retrospective multicenter case-control design. The cases included children admitted to the PICU because of severe acute asthma and a history of out-patient treatment by pediatricians or pediatric pulmonologists. Controls were children with asthma without a PICU admission for severe acute asthma. The children were matched for sex, age, hospital, and time elapsed since the diagnosis of asthma. Fourteen possible risk factors were analyzed., RESULTS: Sixty-six cases were matched to 164 controls. In univariate analysis, all but one of the analyzed variables were significantly associated with PICU-hospitalization. After multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis, 4 risk factors remained significant. These included active or passive smoking, allergies, earlier hospitalization for asthma, and non-sanitized home., CONCLUSIONS: Physicians and parents should be aware of these risk factors, and efforts should be made to counteract them.

N2  - This study aimed to examine the association between the length of use of feeding bottles or pacifiers during childhood and the prevalence of respiratory and allergic morbidities. A large-scale questionnaire survey was performed in day care centers and kindergartens (with children's ages ranging from 2 to 7 years) in southern Taiwan, and a total of 14,862 questionnaires completed by parents were finally recruited for data analysis. Effects of using feeding bottles on children's wheezing/asthma (adjusted OR: 1.05, 95% CI 1.00-1.09), allergic rhinitis (adjusted OR: 1.04, 95% CI 1.00-1.08), and eczema (adjusted OR: 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.2) were found. Moreover, significant dose-dependent relationships were further established after an adjustment for confounders was performed that included children's ages, gender, gestational age, birth weight, length of breastfeeding, the age when first given infant formula or complementary foods, family history, parental educational levels, and smoking status, as well as the problem of indoor water damage. This study was the first to reveal the potential risk of using plastic consumer products such as feeding bottles on the reported health status of preschool children in Asian countries.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of breastfeeding on wheezing and current asthma in children 2 to 6 years of age., STUDY DESIGN: Infants (n=1105) were enrolled in a prospective birth cohort in New Zealand. Detailed information about infant feeding was collected using questionnaires administered at birth and at 3, 6, and 15 months. From this, durations of exclusive and any breastfeeding were calculated. Information about wheezing and current asthma was collected at 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 years. Logistic regression was used to model associations between breastfeeding and outcomes with and without adjustment for confounders., RESULTS: After adjustment for confounders, each month of exclusive breastfeeding was associated with significant reductions in current asthma from 2 to 6 years (all, P<.03). Current asthma at 2, 3, and 4 years was also reduced by each month of any breastfeeding (all, P<.005). In atopic children, exclusive breastfeeding for >= 3 months reduced current asthma at ages 4, 5, and 6 by 62%, 55%, and 59%, respectively., CONCLUSION: Breastfeeding, particularly exclusive breastfeeding, protects against current asthma up to 6 years. Although exclusive breastfeeding reduced risk of current asthma in all children to age 6, the degree of protection beyond 3 years was more pronounced in atopic children. Copyright © 2012 Mosby, Inc.

N2  - Allergic diseases have been increasing during the last three decades, and exact reasons for this are still debated. Despite intense ongoing research, a lot of aspects of allergic diseases are still poorly understood, resulting in limitations in current therapeutic approach to allergies. In this viewpoint, important unanswered research questions are raised mainly on novel therapeutic approaches to allergic children, and suggestions for future research are raised. Three aspects of pediatric allergy are distinguished: the prevention, control, and cure. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

T1  - Vitamin D deficiency as a risk factor for childhood allergic disease and asthma.
A1  - Litonjua, Augusto A
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Over the past 2 years, the number of studies relating vitamin D deficiency and asthma and allergies has increased significantly. The purpose of this review is to update the last review in this journal and examine the evidence of the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and childhood asthma and allergies., RECENT FINDINGS: In the past 2 years since the last review, there have been many studies, both cross-sectional and prospective, that have investigated the effects of vitamin D on the inception and severity of asthma and allergies. Most, but not all, studies have shown that low vitamin D levels increase the risk for asthma and allergies, but a few suggest an increased risk with high levels. Results from small trials of short duration suggest that vitamin D supplementation decreases severity of eczema and decreases the risk for asthma exacerbations., SUMMARY: Data that vitamin D deficiency results in increased risks for asthma and allergies continues to accumulate. However, the optimal level of vitamin D that decreases both the risk for development and severity of these disorders remains elusive. Results of ongoing clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation will be needed before recommendations can be firmly established.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to examine the associations between high BMI and changes in BMI status during the first 7 years of life and asthma and allergic sensitization at age 8 years., METHODS: A birth cohort of newborn infants was followed for 8 years. Repeated parental questionnaires provided information on environmental exposures and health outcomes. Information on height and weight during childhood was retrieved from preschool and school health care records. The analyses included the 2075 children for whom information was available on weight and height, as well as on asthma, at age 8 years., RESULTS: A high BMI (>=85th percentile) at age 1, 4, and/or 7 years was associated with an increased risk of asthma at age 8 years. However, no significant association was observed among children with high BMI at age 12 and/or 18 months (early age) or at age 4 years who developed a normal BMI by age 7 years. The risk was increased among children with high BMI at age 7 years, regardless of their earlier weight. Moreover, we observed an increased risk of sensitization to inhalant allergens among children with high BMI at age 7 years., CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that high BMI during the first 4 years does not increase the risk of asthma at school age among children who have developed a normal weight by age 7 years. However, high BMI at age 7 years is associated with an increased risk of asthma and sensitization to inhalant allergens.

T1  - Effect of photochemical smog associated with synoptic weather patterns on cardiovascular and respiratory hospital admissions in metropolitan Taipei.
A1  - Lai, Li-Wei
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - This study focuses on the relationship between photochemical smog (PS) (hourly ozone conc. >100 ppb), PS-related diseases, and the synoptic weather patterns during 2005-2009 in metropolitan Taipei. The results show that compared to respiratory ailments (ICD code 460-519) and asthma (ICD code 493), cardiovascular ailments (ICD code 390-459) were more clearly influenced by PS events. On the PS event day, the number of admissions of babies, children, and adults increased by 0.04 [95% CI 0.01-0.06], 0.03 [95% CI 0.00-0.07], and 1.12 [95% CI 0.36-1.89] (P < 0.05), respectively. The investigation showed that more than 70% of the PS events were associated primarily with the peripheral circulation of typhoons, Pacific pressure, and discrete Pacific pressure. PS events are a threat to public health. To avoid the ill effects of air pollution, residents should be informed about the daily weather patterns and air quality.

N2  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Parasitic helminth infections can suppress symptoms of allergy, type 1 diabetes, arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease in animal models. We analyzed data from a large, population-based cohort study to determine whether common childhood enterobiasis protects against these diseases., METHODS: We collected information on individual prescriptions filled for the drug mebendazole against Enterobius vermicularis for all children born in Denmark 1995-2008 from the National Register of Medicinal Product Statistics (n = 924,749; age 0-14 years); 132,383 of these children (14%) filled a prescription for mebendazole, 102,482 of the children (11%) had a household peer who was registered with a filled mebendazole prescription, and the remaining 689,884 children (75%) comprised the reference group. Children diagnosed with asthma, type 1 diabetes, juvenile arthritis, ulcerative colitis, or Crohn's disease were identified from the National Patient Registry. We used Poisson regression to estimate confounder-adjusted incidence rate ratios for first in- or outpatient hospital diagnosis of chronic inflammatory disease according to history of mebendazole treatment prescribed to children in the study., RESULTS: Chronic inflammatory disease was diagnosed in 10,352 children during 6.4 million person-years of follow-up. The incidence rate ratios was 1.07 for asthma (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-1.13), 1.05 for type 1 diabetes (95% CI: 0.79-1.12), 1.13 for juvenile arthritis (95% CI: 0.94-1.37), 0.77 for ulcerative colitis (95% CI: 0.41-1.46), and 1.44 for Crohn's disease (95% CI: 0.82-2.53). Results were not modified by number of treatments or age at treatment., CONCLUSIONS: Based on a population-based analysis, enterobiasis does not reduce risk for asthma, type 1 diabetes, arthritis, or inflammatory bowel disease.

N2  - Severe viral respiratory illnesses and atopy are risk factors for childhood wheezing and asthma. The aim of this study was to explore associations between severe respiratory infections and atopy in early childhood with wheeze and asthma persisting into later childhood. 147 children at high atopic risk were followed from birth to age 10 yrs. Data on all respiratory infections occurring in infancy were collected prospectively and viral aetiology ascertained. Atopy was measured by skin prick tests at 6 months, and 2 and 5 yrs. History of wheeze and doctor-diagnosed eczema and asthma was collected regularly until 10 yrs of age. At 10 yrs, 60% of the cohort was atopic, 25.9% had current eczema, 18.4% current asthma and 20.4% persistent wheeze. 35.8% experienced at least one lower respiratory infection (LRI) associated with fever and/or wheeze in first year of life. Children who had wheezy or, in particular, febrile LRI in infancy and were atopic by 2 yrs, were significantly more likely to have persistent wheeze (RR 3.51, 95% CI 1.83-6.70; p<0.001) and current asthma (RR 4.92, 95% CI 2.59-9.36; p<0.001) at 10 yrs. Severe viral respiratory infections in infancy and early atopy are risk factors for persistent wheeze and asthma. The strongest marker of the asthmatogenic potential of early life infections was concurrent fever. The occurrence of fever during respiratory illnesses is an important marker of risk for wheeze and asthma later in childhood, suggesting it should be measured in prospective studies of asthma aetiology.

N2  - The aim of our study was to investigate the association between rapid weight gain in the first 3 months of life and the prevalence of wheeze in the first years of life and lung function at 5 yrs of age. The infants selected were participating in an ongoing birth cohort. Information on growth and respiratory symptoms was collected during the first year of life, and on primary care consultations during total follow-up. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) and forced expiratory flow at 25-75% of forced vital capacity (FEF(25-75%)) were measured at 5 yrs of age. Information on growth and respiratory symptoms was obtained for 1,431 infants, out of whom 235 children had already had 5 yrs of follow-up. Every one-point z-score increase in weight gain resulted in a 37% increase in days with wheeze (incidence rate ratio 1.37, 95% CI 1.27-1.47; p<0.001) and in associated consultations by 16% (incidence rate ratio 1.16, 95% CI 1.01-1.34; p=0.04). Children with rapid weight gain reported significantly more physician-diagnosed asthma. FEV(1) and FEF(25-75%) were reduced by 34 mL (adjusted regression coefficient -0.034, 95% CI -0.056- -0.013; p=0.002) and 82 mL (adjusted regression coefficient -0.082, 95% CI -0.140- -0.024; p=0.006) per every one-point z-score increase in weight gain, respectively. These associations were independent of birthweight. Rapid early weight gain is a risk factor for clinically relevant wheezing illnesses in the first years of life and lower lung function in childhood.

N2  - AIM: Increasing evidence suggests that overweight children are at increased risk of asthma. The association between weight gain and allergy is more complex. The aim was to evaluate the association between overweight or obesity and asthma, allergy, bronchial reactivity or atopic sensitization at school age in children with bronchiolitis in infancy., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Eighty-one children hospitalized for bronchiolitis at <24 months of age attended control visits at 7.2 and 12.3 years of ages. The visits consisted of medical examinations, weight and height measurements, body mass index (BMI) calculations, skin prick tests and exercise challenge tests. BMI >1.3 SD from age- and gender-specific references meant overweight and BMI >2.0 SD obesity., RESULTS: Current or previous overweight or obesity did not increase the risk of asthma, allergy, bronchial reactivity or atopic sensitization at 7.2 or 12.3 years of age. Previous and current obesity decreased the risk of atopic dermatitis, and current overweight and obesity decreased the risk of sensitization to outdoor allergens at 12.3 years of age., CONCLUSION: Previous or current overweight does not increase asthma or allergy risk but current obesity may decrease allergy risk at school age after bronchiolitis in infancy.

N2  - Asthma risk is lower after wheezing associated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) than with non-RSV infection in infancy. RSV is the main wheezing-associated virus in infants aged <6 months. We evaluated the outcome of children hospitalised for bronchiolitis at <6 months of age, with special focus on viral aetiology and early risk factors. Out of 205 infants hospitalised for bronchiolitis at <6 months of age, 127 (62%) attended a control visit at a mean age of 6.5 yrs and the parents of an additional 39 children were interviewed by telephone. Thus, follow-up data collected by identical structured questionnaires were available from 166 (81%) children. Viral aetiology of bronchiolitis, studied on admission by antigen detection or PCR, was demonstrable in 97% of cases. Current asthma was present in 21 (12.7%) children: 8.2% in the 110 former RSV patients versus 24% in non-RSV patients (p=0.01). 45 (27%) children had ever had asthma. In adjusted analyses, atopic dermatitis, non-RSV bronchiolitis and maternal asthma were independently significant early-life risk factors for asthma. The risk of asthma was lower after RSV bronchiolitis than after bronchiolitis caused by other viruses in children hospitalised at <6 months of age.

N2  - UNLABELLED: The true burden of influenza in children is difficult to assess and is probably underestimated as clinical signs are usually nonspecific, and formal viral identification is rarely searched. In this study, we compare the clinical features of infections related to the new H1N1/09 influenza virus with infections due to other respiratory viruses in children consulting in a tertiary care pediatric hospital in Geneva. Between October 1, 2009 and February 10, 2010, 109 patients were recruited, with a median of age of 7 years (range 0.1-18). There were 75 H1N1/09-positive patients (69%), and 32 (43%) had identified risk factors such as asthma or a history of wheezing. Fever (87%), cough (92%), and rhinitis (85%) were the most frequent reported presenting symptoms in both patient groups. H1N1/09-positive patients were significantly older (median of 8.2 vs. 4.6 years) and were more likely to have risk factors (43% vs. 24%) and myalgias (41% vs. 20%). H1N1/09-negative patients had more wheezing episodes (29% vs. 9%), higher rates of dyspnea (28% vs. 20%) and of hospital admissions (35% vs. 16%)., CONCLUSION: Clinical signs cannot reliably differentiate H1N1/09-positive and H1N1/09-negative patients, although we found a higher proportion of myalgias in H1N1/09-positive patients. Severity of disease was lower in H1N1/09-positive than in H1N1/09-negative patients, mostly because of a higher proportion of asthma/wheezing episodes among H1N1/09-negative patients.

N2  - Asthma and dental caries are common chronic health conditions of childhood. The aim of this study was to determine if severity of bronchial asthma is a risk factor for early childhood caries. Asthmatic children aged 71 months or younger were examined for their plaque and caries status and were compared with controls matched for age, sex and socioeconomic status. The results showed that asthmatics as a group had a lower DMFT score than the control group. New asthma management and educational programs may be having a positive spillover effect to the dental arena.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Polymorphisms in the endotoxin-mediated TLR4 pathway genes have been associated with asthma and atopy. We aimed to examine how genetic polymorphisms in innate immunity pathways interact with endotoxin to influence asthma risk in children., METHODS: In a previous analysis of 372 children from the Boston Home Allergens and the Connecticut Childhood Asthma studies, 7 SNPs in 6 genes (CARD15, TGFB1, LY96, ACAA1, DEFB1 and IFNG) involved in innate immune pathways were associated with asthma, and 5 SNPs in 3 genes (CD80, STAT4, IRAK2) were associated with eczema. We tested these SNPs for interaction with early life endotoxin exposure (n = 291), in models for asthma and eczema by age 6., RESULTS: We found a significant interaction between endotoxin and a SNP (rs156265) in ACAA1 (p = 0.0013 for interaction). Increased endotoxin exposure (by quartile) showed protective effects for asthma in individuals with at least one copy of the minor allele (OR = 0.39 per quartile increase in endotoxin, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.01). Endotoxin exposure did not reduce the risk of asthma in children homozygous for the major allele., CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that protective effects of endotoxin exposure on asthma may vary depending upon the presence or absence of a polymorphism in ACAA1.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Most epidemiological studies on pediatric asthma rely on the report of "wheezing" in questionnaires. Our aim was to investigate the understanding of this term by parents and health professionals., METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was carried out in hospital and community settings within the south of Portugal. Parents or caregivers self-completed a written questionnaire with information on social characteristics and respiratory history. Multiple choice questions assessed their understanding of "wheezing". Health professionals (physicians, nurses and physiotherapists) were given an adapted version. We used bivariate analysis and multivariate models to study associations between definitions of "wheezing" and participants' characteristics., RESULTS: Questionnaires from 425 parents and 299 health professionals were included. The term "wheezing" was not recognized by 34% of parents, more frequently those who were younger (OR 0.4 per 10-year increment, 95% CI 0.3-0.7), had lower education (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.5-7.4), and whose children had no history of respiratory disease (OR 4.6, 95% CI 2.5-8.7) (all ORs adjusted). 31% of parents familiar with "wheezing" either did not identify it as a sound, or did not locate it to the chest, while tactile (40%) and visual (34%) cues to identify "wheezing" were frequently used. Nurses reported using visual stimuli and overall assessments more often than physicians (p < 0.01). The geographical location was independently associated with how parents recognized and described "wheezing"., CONCLUSIONS: Different meanings for "wheezing" are recognized in Portuguese language and may be influenced by education, respiratory history and regional terminology. These findings are likely applicable to other non-English languages, and suggest the need for more accurate questionnaires and additional objective measurement instruments to study the epidemiology of wheezing disorders.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To study the prognosis of childhood asthma and the factors influencing asthmatic attacks and prognosis., METHODS: The medical data of 212 children with asthma who were followed up for more than 5 years were retrospectively studied., RESULTS: During the 5-year follow up, asthmatic attacks termination was found in 121 cases (57.1%) and asthma persistence was observed in 91 cases. Respiratory tract infections were found as the major factors inducing asthmatic attacks (71.7%), followed by inhaled allergens (17.0%).The children with asthma induced by respiratory tract infections had a higher remission rate of asthmatic attacks (61.2%) than those induced by allergens (41.7%) or exercises (26.3%). Three risk factors for asthma persistence were identified: concurrent allergic rhinitis and eczema, parental asthma and allergy-induced wheezing., CONCLUSIONS: The 5-year follow-up study demonstrated that asthmatic attacks stopped in the majority of children with asthma. Respiratory tract infections may be the major factors inducing acute asthma attacks. The children with asthma induced by respiratory infections may experience a better outcome. Atopic children or children with the genetic background of atopy are at high risks for the development of persistent asthma.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: We examined the relation between low birth weight and childhood family and neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage and disease onset in adulthood., METHODS: Using US nationally representative longitudinal data, we estimated hazard models of the onset of asthma, hypertension, diabetes, and stroke, heart attack, or heart disease. The sample contained 4387 children who were members of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics in 1968; they were followed up to 2007, when they were aged 39 to 56 years. Our research design included sibling comparisons of disease onset among siblings with different birth weights., RESULTS: The odds ratios of having asthma, hypertension, diabetes, and stroke, heart attack, or heart disease by age 50 years for low-birth weight babies vs others were 1.64 (P < .01), 1.51 (P < .01), 2.09 (P < .01), and 2.16 (P < .01), respectively. Adult disease prevalence differed substantially by childhood socioeconomic status (SES). After accounting for childhood socioeconomic factors, we found a substantial hazard ratio of disease onset associated with low birth weight, which persisted for sibling comparisons., CONCLUSIONS: Childhood SES is strongly associated with the onset of chronic disease in adulthood. Low birth weight plays an important role in disease onset; this relation persists after an array of childhood socioeconomic factors is accounted for.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the cause of food-induced anaphylaxis in children or about the factors that might affect its clinical severity., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the cause of food-induced anaphylaxis in children in Italy and to identify factors that could influence the appearance of symptoms and the severity of anaphylaxis., METHODS: One hundred and sixty-three children with anaphylaxis consecutively attending 29 outpatient allergy clinics throughout Italy were enrolled in this prospective study. Information about past anaphylaxis episodes was collected with a standardized questionnaire. Food sensitization was evaluated by skin-prick test., RESULTS: A clinical history of asthma increased the risk of wheezing [odds ratio (OR) 2.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-4.5] and respiratory arrest (OR 6.9; 95% CI 1.4-34.2). A clinical history of chronic/relapsing gastrointestinal symptoms increased the risk of vomiting (OR 2.1; 95% CI 0.9-4.3), hypotension (OR 7.9; 95% CI 1.9-32.0), and bradycardia/cardiac arrest (OR 9.2; 95% CI 0.9-91.3). The severity of present and previous episodes was similar only in patients with mild or moderate anaphylaxis. Peanut and egg were the most frequent causes of severe anaphylaxis., CONCLUSIONS: A clinical history of asthma and chronic/relapsing gastrointestinal symptoms (probably linked to food allergy) may predict the development of respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms and the severity of anaphylaxis.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Several cross-sectional studies during the past 10 years have observed an increased risk of allergic outcomes for children living in damp or mouldy environments., OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate whether reported mould or dampness exposure in early life is associated with the development of allergic disorders in children from eight European birth cohorts., METHODS: We analysed data from 31 742 children from eight ongoing European birth cohorts. Exposure to mould and allergic health outcomes were assessed by parental questionnaires at different time points. Meta-analyses with fixed- and random-effect models were applied. The number of the studies included in each analysis varied based on the outcome data available for each cohort., RESULTS: Exposure to visible mould and/or dampness during first 2 years of life was associated with an increased risk of developing asthma: there was a significant association with early asthma symptoms in meta-analyses of four cohorts [0-2 years: adjusted odds ratios (aOR), 1.39 (95% CI, 1.05-1.84)] and with asthma later in childhood in six cohorts [6-8 years: aOR, 1.09 (95% CI, 0.90-1.32) and 3-10 years: aOR, 1.10 (95% CI, 0.90-1.34)]. A statistically significant association was observed in six cohorts with symptoms of allergic rhinitis at school age [6-8 years: aOR, 1.12 (1.02-1.23)] and at any time point between 3 and 10 years [aOR, 1.18 (1.09-1.28)]., CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that a mouldy home environment in early life is associated with an increased risk of asthma particularly in young children and allergic rhinitis symptoms in school-age children.

T1  - Pediatric asthma: natural history, assessment, and treatment.
A1  - Herzog, Ronit

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Wheezing and childhood asthma are not synonymous but rather comprise a heterogeneous group of conditions that have different outcomes over the course of childhood. Most infants who wheeze have a transient condition associated with diminished airway function at birth and have no increased risk of asthma later in life. However, children with persistent wheezing throughout childhood and frequent exacerbations represent the main challenge today. Studying the natural history of asthma is important for the understanding and accurate prediction of the clinical course of different phenotypes. To date, a great improvement has been achieved in reducing the frequency of asthma symptoms. However, neither decreased environmental exposure nor controller treatment, as recommended by the recent National Asthma Education And Prevention Program, can halt the progression of asthma in childhood or the development of persistent wheezing phenotype. This review focuses on the recent studies that led to the current understanding of asthma phenotypes in childhood and the recommended treatments. Copyright © 2011 Mount Sinai School of Medicine.

T1  - Evidence for a causal relationship between respiratory syncytial virus infection and asthma.
A1  - Wu, Pingsheng

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infects all children early in life, is the most common cause of infant lower respiratory tract infections, and causes disease exacerbations in children with asthma. Episodes of lower respiratory tract infection in early life are associated with asthma development. Whether RSV infection early in life directly causes asthma or simply identifies infants who are genetically predisposed to develop subsequent wheezing is debatable. Recent studies suggest that these two explanations are not mutually exclusive, and are likely both important in asthma development. An open-label study of RSV immunoprophylaxis administered to preterm infants reduced recurrent wheezing by 50%. Clinical trials of infant RSV prevention, delay or severity reduction on the outcome of childhood asthma would confirm the causal relationship between RSV infection and asthma, and offer a primary prevention strategy.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of asthma controller medication use, choice, and adherence on sleep in children with asthma., DESIGN: A case-crossover analysis examining within-subject differences in controller use between time points with and without sleep problems, based on survey data from 3 time points (baseline, 6 months, and 1 year) of a randomized trial., SETTING: Families were recruited from 2 area practice networks; all assessments were completed by parents online., PARTICIPANTS: Children with asthma, aged 2 to 10 years, as identified by asthma-related medical encounters and prescription fills., MAIN EXPOSURES: Parent report of asthma controller medication use (yes/no), type (inhaled corticosteroid or leukotriene inhibitor), and adherence (daily use, nonadherent use, or nonuse)., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Children's sleep problems, as defined by parent report regarding how often the child had difficulty falling asleep or experienced daytime sleepiness., RESULTS: The analysis included 482 children; 82.6% and 75.9% completed the 6-month and 1-year follow-up visits, respectively. Sleep problems were common, with 19.4% of parents at baseline reporting frequent problems with the child falling asleep and 12.1% reporting frequent daytime sleepiness. Compared with children who did not use a controller medication, children had a decreased risk of problems falling asleep during periods with daily controller use (odds ratio [OR], 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.13-0.92), with a trend toward an effect in those with nonadherent use (0.47; 0.20-1.12). Any controller use, regardless of adherence, was also associated with decreased odds of daytime sleepiness (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.51-0.94). When controller class was examined, leukotriene inhibitors were associated with significantly decreased odds of problems falling asleep (OR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.04-0.78), with or without concomitant use of inhaled corticosteroids, but the results for use of inhaled corticosteroids alone were not statistically significant (0.69; 0.32-1.53)., CONCLUSIONS: Controller medications appear to be effective in reducing sleep problems in children with asthma, and leukotriene inhibitor medications may be especially effective in this population.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In Phase Three of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC), we investigated the relationship between breast feeding in infancy and symptoms of asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema in 6-7 year old children., METHODS: Parents or guardians of 6-7 year old children completed written questionnaires on current symptoms of asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema, and on a range of possible asthma risk factors including a history of breast feeding ever. Prevalence odds ratios were estimated using logistic regression, adjusted for gender, region of the world, language, per capita gross national income, and other risk factors., RESULTS: In all 206,453 children from 72 centres in 31 countries participated in the study. Reported breast feeding ever was not associated with current wheeze, with an odds ratio (adjusted for gender, region of the world, language, per capita gross national income, and factors encountered in infancy) of 0.99 (95% CI 0.92-1.05), current rhinoconjunctivitis (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.93-1.08), current eczema (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.97-1.12), or symptoms of severe asthma (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.87-1.05). Breast feeding was however associated with a reduced risk of severe rhinoconjunctivitis (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.59-0.94) and severe eczema (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66-0.95)., CONCLUSIONS: There was no consistent association between breast feeding use in the first year of life and either a history or current symptoms of wheezing, rhinoconjunctivitis or eczema in 6-7 year old children, but possibly an effect on severe symptoms of the latter two conditions.

N2  - Most studies studying dampness as a risk factor for asthma are of a cross-sectional design. The aim of this study was to investigate if the association between moisture-related problems indoor and asthma found in cross-sectional questionnaire data can be confirmed in longitudinal analyses. The Dampness in Building and Health (DBH) study started in 2000 in Varmland, Sweden, with a baseline questionnaire to all children aged 1-5 y (n = 14,077) and five years later a follow-up questionnaire was distributed to children aged 6-8 y (n = 7,509). Moisture-related problems that were associated with asthma in cross-sectional analysis decreased or disappeared in the longitudinal analysis. However, the association between reports of moldy odor in the homes at baseline and incident asthma remained and became stronger. Our results suggest that cross-sectional data showing associations between moisture-related problems in homes and asthma in children partly can be explained by reporting bias.

T1  - A medical nutrition therapy primer for childhood asthma: current and emerging perspectives.
A1  - McCloud, Emily
A1  - Papoutsakis, Constantina
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children. Prevalence has increased in the past 2 decades and has reached a plateau of approximately 9% of children in the United States, affecting about 6.7 million children. The increased prevalence of childhood asthma has paralleled the increased prevalence in childhood obesity. Changes in diet have also been implicated in the increased prevalence of asthma, among other risk factors. The main symptoms of asthma (ie, wheezing, coughing, and chest tightness) require medical evaluation and monitoring. The cornerstone of asthma management is medication therapy, frequently consisting of inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids and, when needed, therapy of corticosteroids by mouth. As part of the multidisciplinary management of this chronic disease, nutrition assessment and follow-up in childhood asthma is necessary to identify and address relevant nutrition-related problems. These problems can involve food-medication interactions, obesity, gastroesophageal reflux disease, food allergies, and other issues; therefore, individualized medical nutrition therapy is warranted. Finally, counseling to achieve a healthy balanced diet is recommended for overall health and weight management. A recent but small number of descriptive investigations agree that adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern can be associated with a decreased risk of current asthma symptoms in children. Although this evidence is promising, food interventions are required to substantiate an evidence-based foundation for medical nutrition therapy in childhood asthma. At this time, there is no known health risk if a Mediterranean diet is adopted. Copyright © 2011 American Dietetic Association. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Recently, folic acid supplementation during pregnancy was implicated as a potential risk factor for atopic diseases in childhood., OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether folic acid supplementation and higher intracellular folic acid (ICF) levels during pregnancy increase the risk of childhood atopic diseases., METHODS: In the KOALA Birth Cohort Study (N=2834), data on eczema and wheeze were collected by using repeated questionnaires at 3, 7, 12, and 24 months, 4 to 5 years, and 6 to 7 years after delivery. Atopic dermatitis and total and specific immunoglobulin E levels were determined at age 2 years and asthma and lung function at age 6 to 7 years. We defined folic acid use as stand-alone and/or multivitamin supplements according to the period of use before and/or during pregnancy. ICF levels were determined in blood samples taken at ~35 weeks of pregnancy (n=837). Multivariable logistic and linear regression analyses were conducted, with generalized estimating equation models for repeated outcomes., RESULTS: Maternal folic acid supplement use during pregnancy was not associated with increased risk of wheeze, lung function, asthma, or related atopic outcomes in the offspring. Maternal ICF level in late pregnancy was inversely associated with asthma risk at age 6 to 7 years in a dose-dependent manner (P for trend=.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not confirm any meaningful association between folic acid supplement use during pregnancy and atopic diseases in the offspring. Higher ICF levels in pregnancy tended, at most, toward a small decreased risk for developing asthma. Copyright © 2011 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a frequent cause of morbidity and leading cause of death among individuals with sickle cell disease. Yet, ACS in hemoglobin SC disease is not well characterized. The objective of this study was to compare the presentation and clinical course of ACS in individuals with hemoglobin SC disease to that observed in individuals with hemoglobin SS disease., PROCEDURE: We retrospectively reviewed 71 inpatient episodes of ACS in patients with hemoglobin SC disease over a 20-year period. Continuous and categorical data from index cases were compared with that from 71 control cases of ACS in patients with hemoglobin SS disease., RESULTS: Median length of hospitalization was shorter for hemoglobin SC episodes when compared to hemoglobin SS episodes (3.0 vs. 5.0 days, P < 0.001). In comparison to hemoglobin SS patients, a greater proportion of hemoglobin SC patients had a previous history of asthma or wheezing (50.7 vs. 33.8%, OR = 2.01 [1.02-3.96], P = 0.041) and a respiratory complaint of wheeze (11.3 vs. 2.8%, OR = 4.38 [0.90-21.4], P = 0.049). In our multivariate regression model, time to ACS diagnosis and total number of days of oxygen supplementation were independent predictors of length of hospitalization in both hemoglobin SC and SS episodes of ACS., CONCLUSIONS: ACS appears to be less severe in children with hemoglobin SC disease compared to that in children with SS disease. Asthma and wheezing may represent more significant risk factors for the development of ACS in children with hemoglobin SC disease. Copyright © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - AIM: To compare the prevalence of current wheeze in children with Down syndrome (DS), their siblings, and nonrelated population controls., METHODS: This was a case-control study in which the International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood questionnaire for respiratory symptoms was completed by parents for 130 children with DS, 167 of their siblings, and for 119 age- and sex-matched control subjects from the general population., RESULTS: Both wheeze ever and wheeze during the last 12 months was more commonly reported in DS than in their siblings or controls. The relative risk (RR) of current wheeze in DS was 2.8 (95% CI, 1.42-5.51) compared with siblings, and 2.75 (95% CI, 1.28-5.88) compared with controls. A doctor's diagnosis of asthma was found in 3.1% in children with DS, in 4.2% in siblings and in 6.7% in controls. During 4-years follow-up, the diagnosis of asthma could not be confirmed in the 24 DS children with current wheeze, and atopy was found in none of them., CONCLUSION: Wheeze is common in children with DS. This is likely to be related to the factors specific for DS and probably unrelated to asthma. Copyright © 2011 The Author(s)/Acta Paediatrica © 2011 Foundation Acta Paediatrica.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: It is important to predict if preschool children with recurrent wheezing will suffer from asthma in future years. To aid in this early identification, a number of asthma predictive scores have been reported, such as the asthma predictive index (API) and the PIAMA risk score. However, to the best of our knowledge, their predictive properties have not been evaluated in any lower- to middle-income country., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study was carried out including preschoolers aged 1-3 years with recurrent wheezing who came to our Pediatric Pulmonary Unit in Bogota, Colombia. We collected the information required to complete the API index and the PIAMA risk score. At 5-6 years of age, the patients were contacted in order to determine if they were suffering from active asthma. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios (LR) of the API and PIAMA risk scores for the presence of active asthma at 5-6 years old., RESULTS: The mean age at recruitment of the 130 included patients was 27.2 +/- 5.9 months. The loose API yielded a sensitivity of 71.4% (95% CI: 50.0-86.2), specificity of 33.3% (95% CI 23.5-44.8), and positive predictive value of 23.8% (95% CI: 15.0-35.6). The stringent API yielded a sensitivity of 42.9% (95% CI: 24.5-63.5), specificity of 79.2% (95% CI 68.4-86.9), positive predictive value of 37.5% (95% CI: 21.2-57.3), and positive LR of 2.06. The PIAMA risk score yielded a sensitivity of 54.5% (95% CI: 42.6-66.0), specificity of 78.9 (95% CI: 66.7-87.5), positive predictive value of 75.0 (95% CI: 61.2-85.1), and positive LR of 2.59., CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that both indices can be used to predict asthma in preschoolers with recurrent wheezing in the context of a referral hospital.

T1  - The allergic march: can we prevent allergies and asthma?.
A1  - Gordon, Bruce R
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - The allergic march is a progression of atopic disease from eczema to asthma, and then to allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. It appears to be caused by a regional allergic response with breakdown of the local epithelial barrier that initiates systemic allergic inflammation. Genetic and environmental factors predispose to developing the allergic march. There are data to support 4 possible interventions to prevent the allergic march from progressing to asthma: (1) supplements of dietary probiotics, (2) exclusive breast feeding during the first few months of life, or, alternatively (3) use of extensively hydrolyzed infant formulas, (4) treatment with inhalant allergen immunotherapy by either subcutaneous or sublingual methods.

T1  - Increased tobacco exposure in older children and its effect on asthma and ear infections.
A1  - Hawkins, Summer S

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - PURPOSE: To examine selected social determinants of children's exposure to household tobacco use and smoking inside the home and to assess the effect of second-hand smoke exposure on asthma and ear infections across children's age groups., METHODS: A total of 90,961 parents of children aged 0-17 years from the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health were included in the study., RESULTS: In all, 26.2% of parents reported that anyone in the household used tobacco products. Parents of children aged 6-11 and 12-17 years were 1.97 (adjusted OR; 95% CI, 1.65-2.36) and 2.93 (2.46-3.49) times more likely, respectively, to report that someone smoked inside the house than parents of younger children. Second-hand smoke exposure varied by children's race/ethnicity, and children from more disadvantaged circumstances were more likely to be exposed. For all children, they were more likely to ever have asthma if someone in their household used tobacco. Although young children's likelihood of recurrent ear infections did not increase with household tobacco use, children aged 12-17 were 1.67 (1.02-2.72) times more likely to have recurrent ear infections if someone smoked inside their home., CONCLUSION: Family members are increasingly likely to smoke indoors as children age, which may increase adolescents' vulnerability to ear infections. Parents and health professionals should monitor second-hand smoke exposure at home and encourage a smoke-free environment. Copyright © 2011 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

N2  - Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is a widespread among the youngest group of pediatric patients, especially in the young infant, when the immune system is just being formed. A lot of children up to 5 year-old suffer infection many times, not only because of easy pathogen transfer, but also primary incidence of disease doesn't give permanent immunity. This study retrospectively analyses a group of children with confirmed during epidemic period RSV infection. Particular attention was paid to the infection risk factors, varied clinical manifestations of infection, abnormal additional studies and accessible prophylactic action. The treatment and correlation between RSV, recurrent wheezing and asthma were discussed.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Childhood asthma has a high prevalence in South America--a region of the world currently undergoing a thorough modernization and transition process. Asthma in South America is mainly associated with poor urban environment, which actually may challenge the role of the hygiene hypothesis. We systematically assessed the impact of environmental factors in the first year of life on asthma., METHODS: A case-control study including 188 asthmatics and 294 hospital-based controls aged 6-15 years was carried out in the Central South of Chile. Parents of study participants completed a computer-assisted interview on environmental factors (such as birth order, day-care attendance, pneumonia infection, regular animal and furry pet contact, and environmental tobacco smoke exposure) in the first year of life and potential confounders. Atopy was assessed using skin prick tests. Multivariate logistic regression models were calculated to assess the association between exposures and asthma, adjusting for potential confounders., RESULTS: Day-care attendance (OR = 0.31; 95% CI: 0.10, 0.94) and regular farm animal contact (OR = 0.38; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.85) were inversely related to childhood asthma in the logistic regression models. Pneumonia infection (OR = 2.24; 95% CI: 1.21, 4.16) and mold or dampness in the home (OR = 1.87; 95% CI: 1.18, 2.97) in the first year of life were positively associated with asthma., CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the hygiene hypothesis is also applicable in the Chilean setting, a South American country in epidemiological transition.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess improvement in documentation of asthma indicators using the Asthma Toolbox, an asthma decision-making tool developed in accord with National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines., DESIGN: Retrospective medical record review using cross-sectional, independent, random samples. Reviews were conducted for 1-year periods before and after implementation and after revision reflecting 2007 guideline modifications., SETTING: Two inner-city, federally qualified health center programs providing pediatric primary care to housed and homeless populations., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1246 patients aged 6 months to 18 years with at least 1 asthma visit to a community health center using paper records (n = 600) or a mobile medical program serving family homeless shelters using an electronic health record (EHR; n = 646)., INTERVENTION: Implementation of the Asthma Toolbox incorporated into paper encounter forms and embedded in the EHR to guide providers (ie, physicians and nurse practitioners) through pediatric asthma assessment and management., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Documentation of a subset of asthma severity/control measures, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and percentage of persistent asthmatic patients prescribed controller medications., RESULTS: Documentation of each asthma indicator increased significantly after implementation (chi(2) tests; P < .001 all comparisons) for both programs. Documentation of severity/control increased from 25.5% to 77.5% in paper records and from 11.7% to 85.1% in the EHR (P < .001). Increases were sustained after Asthma Toolbox revision for all indicators. The percentage of patients with persistent/uncontrolled asthma prescribed controller medications reached 96% to 97% in both programs., CONCLUSION: Use of the Asthma Toolbox, an asthma decision-making tool, significantly increased documentation of pediatric asthma management among providers working in high-disparity, urban primary care settings.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between asthma and traffic-related pollutants has received considerable attention. The use of individual-level exposure measures, such as residence location or proximity to emission sources, may avoid ecological biases., METHOD: This study focused on the pediatric Medicaid population in Detroit, MI, a high-risk population for asthma-related events. A population-based matched case-control analysis was used to investigate associations between acute asthma outcomes and proximity of residence to major roads, including freeways. Asthma cases were identified as all children who made at least one asthma claim, including inpatient and emergency department visits, during the three-year study period, 2004-06. Individually matched controls were randomly selected from the rest of the Medicaid population on the basis of non-respiratory related illness. We used conditional logistic regression with distance as both categorical and continuous variables, and examined non-linear relationships with distance using polynomial splines. The conditional logistic regression models were then extended by considering multiple asthma states (based on the frequency of acute asthma outcomes) using polychotomous conditional logistic regression., RESULTS: Asthma events were associated with proximity to primary roads with an odds ratio of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.94, 0.99) for a 1 km increase in distance using conditional logistic regression, implying that asthma events are less likely as the distance between the residence and a primary road increases. Similar relationships and effect sizes were found using polychotomous conditional logistic regression. Another plausible exposure metric, a reduced form response surface model that represents atmospheric dispersion of pollutants from roads, was not associated under that exposure model., CONCLUSIONS: There is moderately strong evidence of elevated risk of asthma close to major roads based on the results obtained in this population-based matched case-control study.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal smoke exposure is associated with airway inflammation and asthma in children. It also increases the risk of low birth weight (LBW). LBW is associated with decreased lung function independently of smoking., OBJECTIVE: To study the independent and joint effects of prenatal smoking and LBW on childhood asthma., METHODS: In 1996, all children aged 7 to 8 years in 3 cities in northern Sweden were invited to an International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood questionnaire survey. This study focused on the follow-up of children aged 11 to 12 years, in which 3389 children (96%) participated. A subset of 2121 children underwent skin-prick testing. Self-reported physician-diagnosed asthma has been clinically validated., RESULTS: Mean birth weight was 3360 g in children exposed to prenatal smoking and 3571 g in nonexposed children (P < .001). The association of prenatal smoking with physician-diagnosed asthma was stronger in LBW children (risk ratio: 8.8 [95% confidence interval: 2.1-38]) than in normal birth weight children (risk ratio: 1.3 [95% confidence interval: 1.0-1.8]). LBW alone was not an independent predictor of asthma. These associations were similar in multivariate analysis, and the interaction term LBW x smoking was highly statistically significant., CONCLUSIONS: There was a strong interaction of LBW and prenatal-smoking on the risk of physician-diagnosed asthma, which has not been demonstrated previously. This was consistently seen with adjustment for known risk factors, including allergic sensitization. Plausibly, airway inflammation from prenatal smoke exposure induces obstructive symptoms more easily in the underdeveloped airways of LBW children.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Preterm birth is associated with asthma-like symptoms in childhood and possibly in adolescence, but the longer-term risk of asthma is unknown and increasingly relevant as larger numbers of these individuals enter adulthood. Our objective was to evaluate whether those who were born preterm are more likely to be prescribed asthma medications in young adulthood than those who were born term., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a national cohort study of all singleton infants born in Sweden from 1973 through 1979 (n = 622 616), followed to ages 25.5 to 35.0 years to determine whether asthma medications were prescribed in 2005-2007. Asthma medication data were obtained from all outpatient and inpatient pharmacies throughout Sweden. To improve the positive predictive value for asthma, the outcome was defined as prescription of (1) both a beta-2 agonist inhalant and a glucocorticoid inhalant or (2) a combination inhalant containing a beta-2 agonist and other drugs for obstructive airway diseases., RESULTS: Young adults who were born extremely preterm (23-27 weeks' gestation) were 2.4 times more likely (adjusted 95% CI: 1.41-4.06) to be prescribed asthma medications than those who were born term. No association was found between later preterm birth (28-32 or 33-36 weeks' gestation) and asthma medications in young adulthood., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study with sufficient statistical power to evaluate the risk of asthma beyond adolescence in individuals who were born extremely preterm. The results suggest that extreme preterm birth (23-27 weeks' gestation), but not later preterm birth, is associated with an increased risk of asthma at least into young adulthood.

T1  - The influence of environment, as represented by diet and air pollution, upon incidence and prevalence of wheezing illnesses in young children.
A1  - Bloomberg, Gordon R
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to consider the collective influence of factors affecting recurrent wheezing in young children., RECENT FINDINGS: Specific allergen sensitization, upper respiratory infections, genetic polymorphisms and environmental factors have collectively been reported in the prevalence of and induction of recurrent wheezing in young children. Two examples of environmental factors are diet and exposure to air pollution, both of which are potentially modifiable. Recent investigations provide evidence that a 'Mediterranean diet' and a diet that emphasizes polyunsaturated fatty acids during pregnancy and early infancy, as well as breastfeeding, may be protective for wheezing, and that exposure to traffic-related pollution may be an independent factor in the incidence of wheezing in young children., SUMMARY: Recent studies of early childhood wheezing demonstrate a potentially protective effect of diet and exposure to air pollution as a significant risk factor. An evaluation of collective factors influencing the presence of disease may help to broaden the clinical assessment and give parents and physicians the opportunity to potentially modify circumstances that promote the incidence of recurrent wheezing in infants and preschool aged children.

N2  - The number of human cases of pandemic H1N1 influenza viral infection has increased in Japan since April 2009, as it has worldwide. This virus is widespread in the Yamaguchi prefecture in western Japan, where most infected children exhibited respiratory symptoms. Bronchial asthma is thought to be one of the risk factors that exacerbate respiratory symptoms of pandemic H1N1-infected patients, but the pathogenesis remains unclear. We retrospectively investigated the records of 33 children with pandemic H1N1 influenza viral infection who were admitted to our hospital between October and December 2009 and analyzed their clinical features. The percentage of children with asthma attack, with or without abnormal findings on chest radiographs (pneumonia, atelectasis, etc.), caused by pandemic H1N1 influenza infection was significantly higher than that of children with asthma attack and 2008-2009 seasonal influenza infection. Of the 33 children in our study, 22 (66.7%) experienced an asthma attack. Among these children, 20 (90.9%) did not receive long-term management for bronchial asthma, whereas 7 (31.8%) were not diagnosed with bronchial asthma and had experienced their first asthma attack. However, the severity of the attack did not correlate with the severity of the pulmonary complications of pandemic H1N1 influenza viral infection. The pandemic H1N1 influenza virus greatly increases the risk of lower respiratory tract complications such as asthma attack, pneumonia, and atelectasis, when compared to the seasonal influenza virus. Furthermore, our results suggest that pandemic H1N1 influenza viral infection can easily induce a severe asthma attack, pneumonia, and atelectasis in atopic children without any history of either an asthma attack or asthma treatment.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Asthmatic patients are at higher risk of fracture and bruising due to the systemic side effects of corticosteroid medication. However, the link between asthma and injury leading to these adverse outcomes remains unclear., OBJECTIVE: This study investigated asthma and cause- and type-specific injury at the population level., METHODS: Using data from the 2001 and 2004 Australian National Health surveys (n = 52,768), the prevalence and risk of experiencing specific causes and types of injury in the past 4 weeks were assessed by logistic and Poisson regression analyses., RESULTS: A history of asthma was associated with a higher prevalence of injury for both adults and children, as well as increased risk of incurring various causes and types of injury, after accounting for the effects of confounding factors., CONCLUSIONS: The associations cannot be explained by the physiological systemic side effects of medication alone. Further research is needed to understand the underlying relationship so that an appropriate injury prevention strategy can be developed for asthma sufferers.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood and the leading cause of childhood morbidity from chronic disease. When uncontrolled, asthma can place significant limits on daily life, and is sometimes fatal., OBJECTIVE: This article describes the initial assessment and management of status asthmaticus in children., DISCUSSION: Status asthmaticus is a medical emergency in which asthma symptoms are refractory to initial bronchodilator therapy. Patients may report chest tightness, rapidly progressive shortness of breath, dry cough and wheezing. Typically, patients present a few days after the onset of a viral respiratory illness, following exposure to potent allergens or irritants, or after exercise in a cold environment, however, they can also present with sudden onset of symptoms with an unknown trigger. Early recognition and initiation of therapy is vital in preventing severe complications such as respiratory failure. Aggressive treatment with beta-agonists, anticholinergics and corticosteroids remains the gold standard for this condition.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The extent to which the sensitization to the German cockroach Blattella germanica (BG) affects onset/presence of rhinoconjunctivitis (RC) in children is unknown., OBJECTIVES: The present work was aimed to assess the prevalence of BG sensitization in an outpatient pediatric population from an allergy clinic, the association with allergic diseases, and the effect of age in children with allergic sensitization., METHODS: Five hundred and four consecutive children with at least one positive skin test to a panel of 17 food and inhalant allergens, including BG, and with personal history of atopic diseases, were enrolled in an Allergy Unit of Palermo, Mediterranean area of Southern Italy. A questionnaire was administered to obtain data on epidemiologic and clinical characteristics. Atopy index was computed as the number of the individual positive skin prick tests. Logistic regression was used to estimate the associations between age classes and BG sensitization and RC, as well as the population-attributable risk (PAR) for RC., RESULTS: Prevalence of BG sensitization was 10.5% (5.2% and 15.8% in lower and upper age classes respectively, p=0.0001). Atopy index significantly increased from the lower to the higher age class (p<0.0001). The older age class (OR 3.12; 95% CI 1.57-6.19) and a higher atopy index (OR 37.16; 95% CI 5.04-274.13) were recognized as main risks factors for BG sensitization., CONCLUSION: In the upper age class, the PAR of BG sensitization for RC was 20.6%. BG sensitization increases in the higher ages, along with atopic index, and BG sensitization is associated with rhinoconjunctivis in older allergic children. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recently, obesity has been connected with wheezing, asthma and reduced lung function. Most previous studies have been cross-sectional. The aim of the present follow-up study was to evaluate the association of preceding or current overweight or obesity with lung function at early and late school age after early childhood wheezing., MATERIAL AND METHODS: From the 100 children hospitalized for infection associated wheezing at <24 months of age, 83 attended the control visit at 4.0 years, 82 at 7.2 years and 81 at 12.3 years of age. Flow-volume spirometry was performed in 79 children at 7.2 years and in 80 children at 12.3 years of age. The weight status was assessed by calculating body mass index (BMI) at all visits. Age- and gender-specific BMI standard deviation scores (BMI-SDS) of >1.3 SD and >2.0 SD were defined to mean overweight and obesity, respectively., RESULTS: Overweight at both 7.2 and 12.3 years of age was associated with decreased FEV1 /FVC (forced expiratory volume in 1 sec/forced vital capacity). Overweight and obesity at 7.2 years of age were associated with decreased FEV1 /FVC and MEF50 (maximal expiratory flow at 50% of FVC) at 12.3 years of age. The results were similar by continuous and categorized analyses, being robust to adjustments for viral findings during early childhood wheezing and asthma maintenance medication at school age., CONCLUSION: Overweight and obesity are significant risk factors for reduced lung function at school age after early childhood wheezing. Thus, early-life wheezers should avoid excessive weight gain during childhood. Copyright © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Many studies have reported that antibiotic use may be associated with increased risk of childhood asthma. Respiratory tract infections in small children may be difficult to distinguish from early symptoms of asthma, and studies may have been confounded by "protopathic" bias, where antibiotics are used to treat early symptoms of asthma. These analyses of a cohort including 1,401 US children assess the association between antibiotic use within the first 6 months of life and asthma and allergy at 6 years of age between 2003 and 2007. Antibiotic exposure was associated with increased risk of asthma (adjusted odds ratio = 1.52, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07, 2.16). The odds ratio if asthma was first diagnosed after 3 years of age was 1.66 (95% CI: 0.99, 2.79) and, in children with no history of lower respiratory infection in the first year of life, the odds ratio was 1.66 (95% CI: 1.12, 3.46). The adverse effect of antibiotics was particularly strong in children with no family history of asthma (odds ratio = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.00, 3.58) (P(interaction) = 0.03). The odds ratio for a positive allergy blood or skin test was 1.59 (95% CI: 1.10, 2.28). The results show that early antibiotic use was associated with asthma and allergy at 6 years of age, and that protopathic bias was unlikely to account for the main findings.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Children with food allergies often have concurrent asthma., OBJECTIVE: The authors aimed to determine the prevalence of asthma in children with food allergies and the association of specific food allergies with asthma., METHODS: Parental questionnaire data regarding food allergy, corroborated by allergic sensitization were completed for a cohort of 799 children with food allergies. Multivariate regression analysis tested the association between food allergy and reported asthma., RESULTS: In this cohort, the prevalence of asthma was 45.6%. After adjusting for each food allergy, environmental allergies, and family history of asthma, children with egg allergy (odds ratio [OR] = 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-3.2; P < .01) or tree nut allergy (OR = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.1-3.6; P = .02) had significantly greater odds of report of asthma., CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence of asthma in the food-allergic pediatric population. Egg and tree nut allergy are significantly associated with asthma, independent of other risk factors.

N2  - Epidemiological data suggest that traffic exposures can influence asthma and allergic symptoms among preschool children; however, there is no information on risk reduction via home air-conditioning (AC). The aim of this study is to evaluate the associations of self-reported traffic densities with asthma and allergic symptoms among preschool children and determine whether AC is an effect modifier. A cross-sectional study adopting an expanded and modified ISAAC--International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood conducted on randomly selected 2994 children living in homes without any indoor risk factors. Specific information on demographics, indoor home risk factors, and traffic variables were obtained. Adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were determined by Cox proportional hazard regression model with assumption of a constant risk period controlled for covariates. We found dose-response significant relationships between validated self-reported traffic densities and asthma and rhinitis symptoms. Among children sleeping in non-air-conditioned homes, there were stronger associations between asthma and rhinitis symptoms studied. PRs for heavy traffic density were 2.06 for wheeze (95% CI 0.97-4.38), 2.89 for asthma (1.14-7.32), 1.73 for rhinitis (1.00-2.99), and 3.39 for rhinoconjunctivitis (1.24-9.27). There were no associations found for children sleeping in air-conditioned homes. Our results suggest that AC in the bedroom modifies the health effects of traffic among preschool children. This finding suggests that attention should also be paid to ventilation characteristics of the homes to remediate health-related traffic pollution problems. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

T1  - Predictive clinicopathological features derived from systematic autopsy examination of patients who died with A/H1N1 influenza infection in the UK 2009-10 pandemic.
A1  - Lucas, S
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - BACKGROUND: From April 2009 to January 2010, the pandemic of A/H1N1 influenza affected the UK. There were > 30,000 infections and 457 deaths (all ages). Reports from other countries had indicated that certain comorbidities were associated with a higher risk of death from H1N1 infection, and there was a need to identify these factors in the UK population as knowledge of them could lead to improved treatment in the current epidemic and reduced mortality in future epidemics., OBJECTIVES: To gather all the available clinical pathology information from autopsies performed on patients dying with known or suspected influenza A/H1N1 infection, across the UK. To evaluate comorbidities present in these deceased patients; correlate them with the H1N1-related pathology and treatment-associated pathology, determine their relative contributions and estimate the significant features associated with death., METHODS: To obtain the autopsy reports, standard request letters were sent by e-mail to all histopathologists in the UK on the Royal College of Pathologists list, all the coroners' jurisdictions in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and to procurators fiscal in Scotland. The letters asked for autopsy reports of the autopsied deceased who included: those with H1N1 infection, proven before or after death, and those in whom swine flu was unproven but most likely to have been present; those in whom H1N1 was a minor pathology, as well as those in whom it was the immediate cause of death; those whose cause of death mentioned 'swine flu', 'swine influenza' or 'H1N1 infection'; and those of any age from infancy to old age., RESULTS: Sixty-eight autopsy reports were received: 19 children (0-15 years) and 49 adults (16 + years). All but two autopsies were medico-legal, and only two (3% of the total) were consented. This sample thus represents 15% of the known 457 deaths from H1N1. Median age for children at death was 6 years, for adults it was 41 years. Deaths in children were associated with congenital diseases (47%, 9/19), particularly of the heart and central nervous system. The autopsied children were not obese. Death in adults were associated with pregnancy (three cases in the study, but nationally 12/457 H1N1-associated deaths were noted), obesity (50% of adults had a body mass index >= 30 kg/m2) and chronic respiratory disease (12%, 6/49 adults). Diabetes did not emerge as a risk factor for death, but learning difficulties did. Nearly all the deaths (94%, 64/68) were a consequence of H1N1 infection in the respiratory tract. In more than one-third (41%, 28/68) of the deaths, bacterial secondary infection was the significant complication; the pneumococcus was the most common agent identified (25%, 7/28)., LIMITATIONS: This review is an incomplete medical study of what happened during the epidemic, and the small sample number (68 reports from 457 deaths) limits further speculation. We have no true measure of whether the cases selected for autopsy are representative of the total deaths in terms of pathology and comorbidities., CONCLUSIONS: The major comorbidities associated with death from H1N1 infection were obesity, chronic respiratory disease and pregnancy. Young age at death was confirmed. Congenital disease in children and learning difficulties in adults were also important, but diabetes was not. This methodology of gathering data for research has potential for use in other public health questions, but is dependent on the co-operation of the medico-legal services. These results reinforce the need to enquire further into the pathogenesis of severe and fatal H1N1 disease, and the circumstances of clinical presentation and rapid evaluation in a time of epidemic influenza., FUNDING: The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme.

N2  - The authors carried out a time-series study to determine whether short-term increases in the concentrations of spores were associated with emergency department visits from asthma among children 0 to 9 years of age in Montreal, 1994-2004. Concentrations of spores were obtained from one sampling monitor. The authors used parametric Poisson models to model the association between daily admissions to emergency rooms for asthma and ambient exposures to a variety of spores, adjusting for secular trends, changes in weather, and chemical pollutants. For first admissions and exposures to Basidiomycetes, the authors found positive associations at all lags but the concurrent day. For Deuteromycetes and Cladosporium, risks were positive starting at lag 3 days and diminished at lag 6 days. There was little evidence of associations for readmissions, except for Basidiomycetes. The results indicate that Basidiomycetes and Cladosporium spores may be implicated in the exacerbation of asthma among children, most notably in the case of first-time visits to emergency departments, and that the effects appear to be delayed by several days.

N2  - To study the prevalence of atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma in Taiwan, we analysed the claims data of a nationally representative cohort of 997,729 enrolees from the National Health Insurance register from 2000 to 2007. Overall, 66,446 patients were diagnosed with atopic dermatitis, and 49.8% of them had concomitant allergic rhinitis and/or asthma. The overall 8-year prevalences of atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma were 6.7%, 26.3% and 11.9%, respectively. Children and adolescents had significantly higher prevalences of these atopic diseases. The prevalence of atopic dermatitis in females was lower than that in males before the age of 8 years, but became higher after that. Patients with atopic dermatitis were more likely to have allergic rhinitis and asthma. Those having both atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis possessed an even higher risk for asthma (odds ratio 9.04). The numbers of visits for atopic dermatitis were highest in late spring to mid-summer. These data suggest that atopic diseases are common in Taiwan.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The national prevalence and patterns of food allergy (FA) in the United States are not well understood., OBJECTIVE: We developed nationally representative estimates of the prevalence of and demographic risk factors for FA and investigated associations of FA with asthma, hay fever, and eczema., METHODS: A total of 8203 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2006 had food-specific serum IgE measured to peanut, cow's milk, egg white, and shrimp. Food-specific IgE and age-based criteria were used to define likely FA (LFA), possible FA, and unlikely FA and to develop estimates of clinical FA. Self-reported data were used to evaluate demographic risk factors and associations with asthma and related conditions., RESULTS: In the United States, the estimated prevalence of clinical FA was 2.5% (peanut, 1.3%; milk, 0.4%; egg, 0.2%; shrimp, 1.0%; not mutually exclusive). Risk of possible FA/LFA was increased in non-Hispanic blacks (odds ratio, 3.06; 95% CI, 2.14-4.36), males (1.87; 1.32-2.66), and children (2.04; 1.42-2.93). Study participants with doctor-diagnosed asthma (vs no asthma) exhibited increased risk of all measures of food sensitization. Moreover, in those with LFA, the adjusted odds ratio for current asthma (3.8; 1.5-10.7) and an emergency department visit for asthma in the past year (6.9; 2.4-19.7) were both notably increased., CONCLUSION: Population-based serologic data on 4 foods indicate an estimated 2.5% of the US population has FA, and increased risk was found for black subjects, male subjects, and children. In addition, FA could be an under-recognized risk factor for problematic asthma. Copyright © 2010 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Published by Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if use of paracetamol in early life is an independent risk factor for childhood asthma., DESIGN: Prospective birth cohort study., SETTING: Melbourne Atopy Cohort Study., PARTICIPANTS: 620 children with a family history of allergic disease, with paracetamol use prospectively documented on 18 occasions from birth to 2 years of age, followed until age 7 years., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was childhood asthma, ascertained by questionnaire at 6 and 7 years. Secondary outcomes were infantile wheeze, allergic rhinitis, eczema, and skin prick test positivity., RESULTS: Paracetamol had been used in 51% (295/575) of children by 12 weeks of age and in 97% (556/575) by 2 years. Between 6 and 7 years, 80% (495/620) were followed up; 30% (148) had current asthma. Increasing frequency of paracetamol use was weakly associated with increased risk of childhood asthma (crude odds ratio 1.18, 95% confidence interval 1.00 to 1.39, per doubling of days of use). However, after adjustment for frequency of respiratory infections, this association essentially disappeared (odds ratio 1.08, 0.91 to 1.29). Paracetamol use for non-respiratory causes was not associated with asthma (crude odds ratio 0.95, 0.81 to 1.12)., CONCLUSIONS: In children with a family history of allergic diseases, no association was found between early paracetamol use and risk of subsequent allergic disease after adjustment for respiratory infections or when paracetamol use was restricted to non-respiratory tract infections. These findings suggest that early paracetamol use does not increase the risk of asthma.

N2  - Viral respiratory tract infections are common and usually selflimited illnesses. For patients at risk of asthma, or with existing asthma, viral respiratory tract infections can have a profound effect on the expression of disease or loss of control. New evidence has shown that wheezing episodes early in life due to human rhinoviruses are a major risk factor for the later diagnosis of asthma at age 6 years. For those with existing asthma, exacerbations are a major cause of morbidity, can need acute care, and can, albeit rarely, result in death. Viral respiratory tract infections, predominantly those caused by human rhinoviruses, are associated with asthma exacerbations. There is also evidence that deficiencies in antiviral activity and the integrity of the airway epithelial barrier could make individuals with asthma more likely to have severe viral respiratory infections of the lower airway, and thus increase the risk of exacerbation. In view of the effect of respiratory viruses on many aspects of asthma, efforts to understand the mechanisms and risk factors by which these airway infections cause changes in airway pathophysiology are a first step towards improved treatment.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Perioperative respiratory adverse events in children are one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality during paediatric anaesthesia. We aimed to identify associations between family history, anaesthesia management, and occurrence of perioperative respiratory adverse events., METHODS: We prospectively included all children who had general anaesthesia for surgical or medical interventions, elective or urgent procedures at Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Perth, Australia, from Feb 1, 2007, to Jan 31, 2008. On the day of surgery, anaesthetists in charge of paediatric patients completed an adapted version of the International Study Group for Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire. We collected data on family medical history of asthma, atopy, allergy, upper respiratory tract infection, and passive smoking. Anaesthesia management and all perioperative respiratory adverse events were recorded., FINDINGS: 9297 questionnaires were available for analysis. A positive respiratory history (nocturnal dry cough, wheezing during exercise, wheezing more than three times in the past 12 months, or a history of present or past eczema) was associated with an increased risk for bronchospasm (relative risk [RR] 8.46, 95% CI 6.18-11.59; p<0.0001), laryngospasm (4.13, 3.37-5.08; p<0.0001), and perioperative cough, desaturation, or airway obstruction (3.05, 2.76-3.37; p<0.0001). Upper respiratory tract infection was associated with an increased risk for perioperative respiratory adverse events only when symptoms were present (RR 2.05, 95% CI 1.82-2.31; p<0.0001) or less than 2 weeks before the procedure (2.34, 2.07-2.66; p<0.0001), whereas symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection 2-4 weeks before the procedure significantly lowered the incidence of perioperative respiratory adverse events (0.66, 0.53-0.81; p<0.0001). A history of at least two family members having asthma, atopy, or smoking increased the risk for perioperative respiratory adverse events (all p<0.0001). Risk was lower with intravenous induction compared with inhalational induction (all p<0.0001), inhalational compared with intravenous maintenance of anaesthesia (all p<0.0001), airway management by a specialist paediatric anaesthetist compared with a registrar (all p<0.0001), and use of face mask compared with tracheal intubation (all p<0.0001)., INTERPRETATION: Children at high risk for perioperative respiratory adverse events could be systematically identified at the preanaesthetic assessment and thus can benefit from a specifically targeted anaesthesia management., FUNDING: Department of Anaesthesia, Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Swiss Foundation for Grants in Biology and Medicine, and the Voluntary Academic Society Basel.

N2  - RATIONALE: Desert dust particles, including quartz, which causes inflammatory responses in the airway in animal studies, are transported to widespread regions around the globe. Epidemiologically, areas impacted by desert dust storms, such as communities in the Middle East and the Caribbean, seem to have higher incidences of asthma than might be expected., OBJECTIVES: We investigated the magnitude of association between airborne mineral dust concentration and hospitalization of children for asthma exacerbation by using Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) with a polarization analyzer for an exposure measurement, which can distinguish mineral dust particles from other particles., METHODS: A case-crossover design was used. The exposure measurement was LIDAR's nonspherical extinction coefficient. The outcome measurement was hospitalization of children aged 1 to 15 years for asthma exacerbation in eight principal hospitals in Toyama, a local area in Japan bordering the Japan Sea, during February to April, 2005 to 2009., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: During the study period, there were 620 admissions for asthma exacerbation, and 6 days with a heavy dust event (daily mineral dust concentration > 0.1 mg/m(3)). Conditional logistic regression showed a statistically significant association between asthma hospitalization and a heavy dust event. The crude odds ratio (OR) of the heavy dust event for hospitalization on the day was 1.88 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-3.41; P = 0.037), and the OR of heavy dust event during the previous week was 1.83 (95% CI, 1.31-2.56; P = 0.00043). The OR adjusted by other air pollutant levels, pollen, and meteorological factors was 1.71 (95% CI, 1.18-2.48; P = 0.0050)., CONCLUSIONS: Heavy dust events are associated with an increased risk of hospitalizations for asthma.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is one of the most common complications in children hospitalized with influenza. We describe hospitalized children with influenza-associated pneumonia and associated risk indicators., METHODS: Through Emerging Infections Program Network population based surveillance, children aged <18 years hospitalized with laboratory confirmed influenza with a chest radiograph during hospitalization were identified during the 2003-2008 influenza seasons. A case with radiologically confirmed influenza-associated pneumonia was defined as a child from the surveillance area hospitalized with: (1) laboratory-confirmed influenza and (2) evidence of new pneumonia on chest radiograph during hospitalization. Hospitalized children with pneumonia were compared with those without pneumonia by univariate and multivariate analysis., RESULTS: Overall, 2992 hospitalized children with influenza with a chest radiograph were identified; 1072 (36%) had influenza-associated pneumonia.When compared with children hospitalized with influenza without pneumonia, hospitalized children with influenza-associated pneumonia were more likely to require intensive care unit admission (21% vs. 11%, P < 0.01), develop respiratory failure (11% versus 3%, P < 0.01), and die(0.9% vs. 0.3% P 0.01). In multivariate analysis, age 6 to 23 months(adjusted OR: 2.1, CI: 1.6 -2.8), age 2 to 4 years (adjusted OR: 1.7, CI:1.3-2.2), and asthma (adjusted OR: 1.4, CI: 1.1-1.8) were significantly associated with influenza-associated pneumonia., CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized children with influenza-associated pneumonia were more likely to have a severe clinical course than other hospitalized children with influenza, and children aged 6 months to 4 years and those with asthma were more likely to have influenza-associated pneumonia.Identifying children at greater risk for influenza-associated pneumonia will inform prevention and treatment strategies targeting children at risk for influenza complications.

T1  - Passive smoking damages children's health.
A1  - Britton, John
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Passive smoking in children accounts for an estimated 300,000 general practice consultations in the UK each year, the majority of which are for middle ear disease. There are also more than 100,000 asthma consultations in children attributable to passive smoking. Active maternal smoking causes up to about 5,000 miscarriages, 300 perinatal deaths, and 2,200 premature singleton births in the UK each year. Living in a household in which one or more people smoke more than doubles the risk of sudden infant death. Smoking by the mother increases the riskof lower respiratory infections by about 60%, and smoking by any household member by more than 50%. Passive smoking increases the risk of wheezing at all ages. The effect is strongest for smoking by the mother, with increases in risk of 65% to 77% according to the age of the child. It also increases the risk of asthma, with the risk increased by household smoking by about 50%, in school-aged children, and for middle ear disease, the risk is increased by about 35%. The simplest way to prevent passive exposure of children to tobacco smoke is to encourage and support their parents to quit smoking.

N2  - Asthma is one of the leading chronic illnesses among children in the United States. International epidemiological studies have also shown asthma prevalence is an increasing problem. The objective of this study was to examine the correlates of access to care among asthmatic children age 0-17 in the United States. This is a retrospective study and secondary data analysis of the 2000 National Health Interview Survey. Parametric testing using univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were performed to examine health care utilization among children with asthma in the United States. It was found that Black children were highly associated with not visiting a general doctor in the past 12 months (OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.30, 0.75). Uninsured asthmatic children were associated with the risk of not seeing a general doctor in the past 12 months (OR 0.40; 95% CI 0.23, 0.69). Our study findings indicate disparities among Black children with asthma and their ability to access appropriate health care services. Additional studies are required to identify factors that contribute to the temporal trends in asthma and country of origin.

N2  - UNLABELLED: In a nested case-control study with 198 children with asthmatic and allergic symptoms (cases) and 202 healthy controls in Varmland, Sweden, we have investigated the relationship between mold spore exposure (mean colony-forming unit) indoor and (i) different indexes of moldy odor indoor (observed by professional inspectors and reported by parents), (ii) visible signs of dampness in the homes of the children (observed and reported), and (iii) doctor-diagnosed asthma/allergy in children. No association was found between the spore concentration indoor and moldy odor and signs of visible dampness in the homes. When a semi-quantitative method in distinguishing between moldy houses or non-moldy houses was used, there were no significant differences between the observed indexes of moldy odor or visible signs of dampness (both observed and reported). No association could be found between the spore concentration in indoor air and asthma/allergy in the children., PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Mold spore exposure indoor have been suggested as a possible explanation for airway problems such as asthma and allergy among people living in buildings with moisture-related problems. However, this investigation could not find any associations between the spore concentrations in indoor air and signs of dampness and moldy odor reported by parents or observed by professional inspectors. Neither was there any association between the indoor spore concentration and asthma/allergy among children. With these results, there is no reason for one-time air sampling of mold colony-forming unit (CFU) in indoor air of homes to identify risk factors for asthma/allergy in children living in Scandinavian countries.

T1  - Health disparities in the Native Hawaiian homeless.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - While it is well accepted that Native Hawaiians have poor health statistics compared to other ethnic groups in Hawaii, it is not well documented if these disparities persist when comparing Native Hawaiian homeless individuals to the general homeless population. This paper examines the Native Hawaiian homeless population living in three shelters on the island of Oahu, to determine if there are significant differences in the frequency of diseases between the Native Hawaiian and non-Native Hawaiian homeless. A retrospective data collection was performed using records from the Hawaii Homeless Outreach and Medical Education (H.O.M.E.) project. Data from 1182 patients was collected as of 12/05/09. Information collected included patient demographics, frequency of self reported diseases, family history of diseases, risk factors, prevalence of chronic diseases, and most common complaints. The data from Native Hawaiians and non-Native Hawaiians were examined for differences and a 1-tail Fisher exact analysis was done to confirm significance. The data reveals that the Native Hawaiian homeless population is afflicted more frequently with asthma and hypertension compared to other ethnic groups. While diabetes constituted more visits to the clinics for Native Hawaiians compared to the non-Native Hawaiians, there was no significant difference in patient reported prevalence of diabetes. The Native Hawaiian homeless also had increased rates of risky behaviors demonstrated by higher past use of marijuana and methamphetamines. Interestingly, there was a lower use of alcohol in the Native Hawaiian homeless and no significant difference between Native Hawaiians and non-native Hawaiians in current use of illicit drugs, which may represent a hopeful change in behaviors. These troubling statistics show that some of the health disparities seen in the general Native Hawaiian population persist despite the global impoverished state of all homeless. Hopefully, these results will aid organizations like the H.O.M.E. project to better address the health needs of the Native Hawaiian homeless population. Hawaii Medical Journal Copyright 2010.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined the associations of history of ear infections in infancy with doctor-diagnosed asthma in a large sample of Mexican American children., METHODS: In this population-based cross-sectional study, parents of 2023 children completed a questionnaire that collected data on doctor-diagnosed asthma, doctor-diagnosed ear infections, as well as antibiotics use in infancy, and other potential confounding variables., RESULTS: Children with a history of ear infections in infancy were more likely to have asthma compared with those who had no history of ear infections in infancy; the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were 2.52 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.35-4.69) and 1.27 (95% CI: 0.79-2.04) in children who had >or=3 and 1-2 (versus none) ear infections in infancy, respectively, p for trend = .0074. These associations were independent of antibiotics use, acetaminophen consumption, and history of various infections (other than ear infections) in the first year of life. In stratified analyses, the increased risk of asthma in children with recurrent ear infections in infancy persisted among children whose parents reported no lifetime history of rhinitis but not in children who had a history of rhinitis., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated significant associations of asthma with history of ear infections in infancy, with a significant dose-response effect of repeated ear infections on the odds of asthma. These findings add to the growing body of literature linking early childhood infections with the risk of asthma and highlight the need for more research to identify the mechanisms through which ear infections may be associated with asthma.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Persistent asthma in adults starts often early in childhood and is associated with alterations in respiratory function that occur early in life., OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the importance of innate and environmental factors associated with occurrence of asthma during childhood in a population of recurrent wheezing infants followed prospectively., METHODS: A cohort of infants less than 30 months old with recurrent wheezing was established in order to assess severity of respiratory symptoms and to look for the presence of atopy and environmental risk factors. At the age of 6 years, they were reevaluated with respect to remission or persistence of wheezing over the previous 12-month period., RESULTS: Data were available for 219 subjects aged 15 +/- 5 months. In 27% of the infants with recurrent wheeze, wheezing persisted until the age of 6 years. In multivariate analysis, stepwise logit analysis showed that the risk factors for persistent wheezing are eosinophilia >or=470/mm(3), allergenic sensitization, and a father with asthma. Environmental factors present during the first year of life that protect from persistence of wheezing are ( 1 ) breastfeeding for longer than 3 months, ( 2 ) pets at home, and ( 3 ) >or=3 siblings. The detection rate for persistent wheezing in this model is 72%. The persistence score showed good specificity 91% but low sensitivity 35%., CONCLUSION: This study confirms the role of atopic host factors on wheezing persistence during childhood and detected protective environmental factors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The association between asthma and anaphylaxis remains poorly understood., OBJECTIVE: To ascertain, in a managed care organization in northern California, the association of asthma and asthma severity with future risk of anaphylactic shock and other selected allergy diagnoses., METHODS: Using electronic data and validated algorithms, we assembled a cohort of 526,406 patients who met the criteria for asthma between 1996 and 2006 and a referent cohort (with no utilization for asthma) individually matched on age, sex, and race/ethnicity. In each cohort, 54% of patients were female and 55% were white; their mean (SD) age was 24 (20) years. The main outcome measures were anaphylactic shock (caused by an adverse food reaction, caused by serum, or other/idiopathic), allergic urticaria, anaphylaxis after sting(s), and angioedema., RESULTS: The incidence of anaphylactic shock was 109.0 per 100,000 person-years in the asthma cohort and 19.9 per 100,000 person-years in the referent cohort. After adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, and immunotherapy, asthma was associated with a 5.2-fold (95% confidence interval, 4.7- to 5.6-fold) increased hazard of anaphylactic shock. Asthma was also significantly associated with an increased risk of the 3 selected allergy diagnoses, with hazard ratios of 1.4 to 1.9. A significant trend by severity of asthma was apparent for food-related and other/idiopathic anaphylactic shock and for anaphylaxis after sting(s)., CONCLUSIONS: In this insured population, asthma was prospectively associated with increased risk of anaphylactic shock and other allergy diagnoses. However, the effect of asthma severity was not consistent across outcome measures.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between gestational age at birth (late preterm vs term) and risk for physician-diagnosed asthma., STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-1994) linked natality files. The study included children age 2-83 months from singleton births, born late preterm (n=537) or term (n=5650). Using survival analysis, we modeled time to diagnosis of asthma; children with no asthma diagnosis were censored at the age of their survey interview. We used Cox proportional hazard regression to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for gestational age and asthma risk, adjusting for maternal age, maternal education, parental history of asthma/hay fever, maternal smoking history during pregnancy, race/ethnicity, and sex of the child., RESULTS: Adjusted analysis showed that physician-diagnosed asthma was modestly associated with late preterm birth (hazard ratio, 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.8-2.0), but this association was not statistically significant (P=.30)., CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that late preterm birth was not associated with a diagnosis of asthma in early childhood.

N2  - The role of early childhood infections and immunisation in the development of allergic diseases remains controversial. To examine these associations, six hundred and twenty infants with first-degree relatives with allergic diseases were recruited into the Melbourne Atopy Cohort Study. Information on risk factors and outcomes was collected by interviewer administered questionnaire and was based on parental report and/or a physician's diagnosis. Risk factors examined included early childhood infections (including gastroenteritis, otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections) and immunisations in the first 2 yr of life. Outcomes were current asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema at 6 yr of age. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis were used to estimate relative risk (RR) and assess confounding. By 6 yr, 79% of the original cohort remained in the study. Those with at least three episodes of gastroenteritis showed an increased risk (crude RR 2.36, 95%CI 1.41 3.95; adjusted RR 2.03 95%CI 1.50 2.75) for the later development of asthma at age 6. Of the scheduled immunisations, Sabin immunisation in the second year had a reduced risk of asthma at 6 yr (crude RR 0.60, 95%CI 0.37 0.98; adjusted RR 0.63 95%CI 0.39 1.02). Combined diphtheria and tetanus (CDT) immunisation in the first year had an increased risk of asthma at 6 yr (RR 1.76, 95%CI 1.11 2.78; adjusted RR 1.88 95%CI 1.28 2.77). Recurrent gastroenteritis in early childhood is associated with a later risk of asthma. This may reflect a cause and effect relationship, or exposure to common risk factors. In contrast, Sabin immunisation in the second year is associated with a decreased risk of asthma in later childhood. CDT immunisation in the first year may be a risk factor for asthma, but the need for CDT immunisation may also be a marker of increased risk of asthma in later childhood.

N2  - Changes in lung function due to childhood asthma have been reported to occur before school age, and to persist throughout life. The aim was to assess the relationship between aspects of lung function and asthma over time in 4,089 children participating in the large population-based birth cohort BAMSE. Questionnaires were administered at 1, 2, 4, and 8 years of age. At 4 and 8 years, children were invited to a clinical examination, in which 2,965 and 2,630 children participated, respectively. The examinations included blood sampling for evaluation of sensitization to airway allergens (n = 2,053), peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements at 4 and 8 years (n = 1,957), and forced expiratory flows (n = 2,455) at 8 years. Asthma onset before the age of 4 years, but no thereafter, was at 8 years associated with impaired spirometric flows. This was seen irrespective of symptom presence after the age of 4. Reduced PEF growth between the age of 4 and 8 was seen only for the group of children with early onset transient asthma, while an association between sensitization and lung function was only seen in the late-onset asthma group. In conclusion, school children with asthma have reductions of spirometric flows when categorized as persistent or transient early onset asthma, even if this latter group of children is completely symptom-free at school age.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There is much interest in the possibility that perinatal factors may influence the risk of disease in later life. We investigated the influence of maternal and perinatal factors on subsequent hospital admission for asthma in children., METHODS: Analysis of data from the Oxford record linkage study (ORLS) to generate a retrospective cohort of 248 612 records of births between 1970 and 1989, with follow-up to records of subsequent hospital admission for 4 017 children with asthma up to 1999., RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed significant associations between an increased risk of admission for asthma and later years of birth (reflecting the increase in asthma in the 1970s and 1980s), low social class, asthma in the mother, unmarried mothers, maternal smoking in pregnancy, subsequent births compared with first-born, male sex, low birth weight, short gestational age, caesarean delivery, forceps delivery and not being breastfed. Multivariate analysis, identifying each risk factor that had a significant effect independently of other risk factors, confirmed associations with maternal asthma (odds ratio (OR) 3.1, 95% confidence interval 2.7-3.6), male sex (versus female, 1.8, 1.7-2.0), low birth weight (1000-2999 g versus 3000-3999 g, 1.2, 1.1-1.3), maternal smoking (1.1, 1.0-1.3) and delivery by caesarean section (1.2; 1.0-1.3). In those first admitted with asthma under two years old, there were associations with having siblings (e.g. second child compared with first-born, OR 1.3, 1.0-1.7) and short gestational age (24-37 weeks versus 38-41 weeks, 1.6, 1.2-2.2). Multivariate analysis confined to those admitted with asthma aged six years or more, showed associations with maternal asthma (OR 3.8, 3.1-4.7), age of mother (under 25 versus 25-34 at birth, OR 1.16, 1.03-1.31; over 35 versus 25-34, OR 1.4, 1.1-1.7); high social class was protective (1 and 2, compared with 3, 0.72; 0.63-0.82). Hospital admission for asthma in people aged over six was more common in males than females (1.4; 1.2-1.5); but, by the teenage years, the sex ratio reversed and admission was more common in females than males., CONCLUSION: Several maternal characteristics and perinatal factors are associated with an elevated risk of hospital admission for asthma in the child in later life.

T1  - The Urban Environment and Childhood Asthma study.
A1  - Gern, James E
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Childhood asthma is not distributed evenly throughout the population, and children who grow up in crowded urban neighborhoods have higher rates of asthma and experience greater morbidity because of asthma. There are several environmental and lifestyle factors associated with urban living that are suspected to promote the development of asthma, particularly in the first few years of life. Collectively, this information suggests the hypothesis that exposure in early life to adverse environmental and lifestyle factors associated with disadvantaged urban environments modifies immune development to increase the risk for allergic diseases and asthma. The Urban Environment and Childhood Asthma (URECA) birth cohort study was initiated in 2004 to test this hypothesis. The study population was recruited prenatally and consisted of 560 families from 4 urban areas who were at high risk for allergies and/or asthma on the basis of parental histories, along with an additional 49 families without atopic parents. Immune development, respiratory illnesses, and exposure to stress, indoor pollutants, microbial products, and allergens were measured prospectively, and the major study outcomes are recurrent wheeze at 3 years of age and asthma at age 7 years. This review summarizes the study design, methods, and early findings of the URECA study.

N2  - Paracetamol use represents a putative risk factor for the development of asthma. There is convincing epidemiological evidence that the risk of asthma may be increased with exposure to paracetamol in the intrauterine environment, infancy, later childhood and adult life. A dose-dependent association has also been observed in these different age groups in different populations world-wide. An association has also been shown between paracetamol use in both rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema. There is biological plausibility with paracetamol use leading to decreased glutathione levels resulting in increased oxidant-induced inflammation and potentially enhanced T-helper type 2 responses. At the population level, patterns of paracetamol use might explain, to some extent, the world-wide variation in the prevalence of asthma and related disorders, particularly the high rates in English-speaking countries, which have high per capita prescription and over-the-counter use of paracetamol. A temporal association also exists between the international trends of increasing paracetamol use and increasing prevalence of asthma over recent decades. Further research is urgently required, in particular randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) into the long-term effects of frequent paracetamol use in childhood, to determine the magnitude and characteristics of any such risk. Importantly, RCTs will also enable evidence-based guidelines for the recommended use of paracetamol to be developed.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to determine the association between sociodemographic factors and the elimination of allergen sources from homes of asthmatic children., METHOD: In a cross-sectional analysis of data from 845 asthmatic children, multiple linear regression investigated the association between socioeconomic factors and failure to reduce allergen sources (i.e., stuffed toys, pets, carpeting, curtains, and cushions); failure to use linen covers; and not laundering linens weekly in hot water. Logistic regression assessed the relationship between socioeconomic status and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke., RESULTS: Mother's employment status was significantly associated with the quality of the home environment (P = .0002). Homemakers demonstrated fewer poor practices (3.1) compared with full-time or part-time employed mothers (3.6). Children whose mothers reported no post-secondary education were more likely to have environmental tobacco smoke exposure compared with those who had a post-secondary CE education or higher (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.7, 3.5)., DISCUSSION: Children whose mothers worked at home and were better educated were at reduced risk for exposure to sources of indoor allergens.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between chorioamnionitis and childhood asthma based on gestational age at birth and race/ethnicity., DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study using the Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) Matched Perinatal records., SETTING: Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Pasadena, California., PARTICIPANTS: All singleton children born in KPSC hospitals between 1991 and 2007 (N = 510 216)., MAIN EXPOSURE: Clinically diagnosed chorioamnionitis., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Physician-diagnosed asthma in children aged 8 years or younger., RESULTS: The incidence rates of asthma among preterm- and full term-born children of pregnancies complicated by chorioamnionitis were 100.7 and 39.6 per 1000 person-years, respectively (incidence rate ratio, 2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6-3.3). Children aged 8 years or younger with asthma were more likely to be born to women who were aged 35 years or older, African American, had 13 or more years of education, had maternal asthma, used antibiotics, had chorioamnionitis during the pregnancy, and had a male child. Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that children born at 23 to 28, 29 to 33, and 34 to 36 weeks' gestation after pregnancies complicated by chorioamnionitis had a 1.23-fold (95% CI, 1.02-1.49), 1.51-fold (95% CI, 1.26-1.80), and 1.20-fold (95% CI, 1.03-1.47), respectively, increased risk of asthma compared with children of similar gestational age born after pregnancies not complicated by chorioamnionitis. A preterm pregnancy complicated by chorioamnionitis was associated with increased risk of asthma among white (hazard ratio [HR], 1.66; 95% CI, 1.32-2.07), African American (HR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.60-2.44), and Hispanic (HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.45-2.00), but not Asian/Pacific Islander (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.83-1.58) women., CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that chorioamnionitis at preterm gestation is independently associated with increased risk of childhood asthma.

N2  - Recent studies suggest that swimming in chlorinated pools during infancy may increase the risks of lower respiratory tract infection. The aim of the present study was to assess the influence of swimming in chlorinated pools on the risks of bronchiolitis and its late consequences. A total of 430 children (47% female; mean age 5.7 yrs) in 30 kindergartens were examined. Parents completed a questionnaire regarding the child's health history, swimming practice and potential confounders. Attendance at indoor or outdoor chlorinated pools ever before the age of 2 yrs was associated with an increased risk of bronchiolitis (OR 1.68; 95% CI 1.08-2.68; p = 0.03), which was exposure-dependent for both types of pool (p-value for trend <0.01). Associations persisted, and were even strengthened, by the exclusion of other risk factors. Among children with no parental antecedents of atopic disease or no day-care attendance, odds ratios for bronchiolitis amounted to 4.45 (1.82-10.9; p = 0.001) and 4.44 (1.88-10.5; p = 0.007) after >20 h spent in chlorinated pools during infancy. Infant swimmers who developed bronchiolitis also showed higher risks of asthma and respiratory allergies later in childhood. Swimming pool attendance during infancy is associated with a higher risk of bronchiolitis, with ensuing increased risks of asthma and allergic sensitisation.

T1  - Patients hospitalized with 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) - New York City, May 2009.
A1  - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - The first cases of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in New York City occurred in April 2009, raising many questions about how best to contain the epidemic. To rapidly assess the severity of influenza illness and identify persons at highest risk for severe infection, the New York City (NYC) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) reviewed the medical charts of the first 99 patients with laboratory confirmed H1N1 admitted to any NYC hospital. The purpose of the review was to characterize the demographics of the first hospitalized patients, identify associated underlying medical conditions, describe the course and severity of disease, and examine the use of antiviral medications. This report summarizes the findings of this analysis. Approximately 60% of admitted patients were aged <;18 years. The most commonly documented underlying condition was asthma, observed among 50% of patients aged <18 years and 46% of adult patients. Multiple underlying conditions were observed in 17% of patients (12% of children, 24% of adults). Patients treated with oseltamivir within 2 days of symptom onset had shorter median hospitalizations than those who did not (2 days versus 3 days [p = 0.03]). The findings of this assessment were used to inform immediate outbreak response measures in New York City. During such outbreaks, public education campaigns should encourage patients at high risk of severe illness to seek treatment promptly after symptom onset and should emphasize the importance of early antiviral therapy for patients with underlying risk conditions.

T1  - The role of rhinovirus infections in the development of early childhood asthma.
A1  - Jackson, Daniel J
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To discuss the role of human rhinoviruses (HRVs) in early childhood wheezing illnesses and how HRVs contribute to the development of childhood asthma., RECENT FINDINGS: Advanced molecular diagnostics have identified HRVs as pathogens frequently causing wheezing illnesses in infants and young children. Wheezing during HRV infection in early life identifies children at particularly high-risk of asthma development. Plausible mechanisms by which HRV could cause airway damage, promote airway remodeling, and lead to asthma development have recently been identified., SUMMARY: HRV is a significant source of morbidity in infants and young children. The present review identifies mechanisms by which HRV lower respiratory tract infection, particularly in a susceptible host, could promote the development of childhood asthma. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the link between HRV wheezing in early childhood and subsequent asthma development, with the critical goal of identifying novel therapeutic and prevention strategies for both early childhood wheezing and asthma.

N2  - RATIONALE: The role of air pollution exposure in the development of asthma, allergies, and related symptoms remains unclear, due in part to the limited number of prospective cohort studies with sufficiently long follow-ups addressing this problem., OBJECTIVES: We studied the association between traffic-related air pollution and the development of asthma, allergy, and related symptoms in a prospective birth cohort study with a unique 8-year follow-up., METHODS: Annual questionnaire reports of asthma, hay fever, and related symptoms during the first 8 years of life were analyzed for 3,863 children. At age 8, measurements of allergic sensitization and bronchial hyperresponsiveness were performed for subpopulations (n = 1,700 and 936, respectively). Individual exposures to nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), particulate matter (PM(2.5)), and soot at the birth address were estimated by land-use regression models. Associations between exposure to traffic-related air pollution and repeated measures of health outcomes were assessed by repeated-measures logistic regression analysis. Effects are presented for an interquartile range increase in exposure after adjusting for covariates., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Annual prevalence was 3 to 6% for asthma and 12 to 23% for asthma symptoms. Annual incidence of asthma was 6% at age 1, and 1 to 2% at later ages. PM(2.5) levels were associated with a significant increase in incidence of asthma (odds ratio [OR], 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-1.49), prevalence of asthma (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.04-1.51), and prevalence of asthma symptoms (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.28). Findings were similar for NO(2) and soot. Associations were stronger for children who had not moved since birth. Positive associations with hay fever were found in nonmovers only. No associations were found with atopic eczema, allergic sensitization, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness., CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to traffic-related air pollution may cause asthma in children.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Housing conditions can contribute to allergen exposures that are linked to asthma, but little is known about which of those conditions are most likely to predict high levels of allergens in settled house dust., METHODS: We pooled allergen, housing condition, occupant behavior, demographic, and other data from nine asthma studies (n=950 homes in 6 US cities). Dust mite (Der f 1 or Der p 1), cockroach (Bla g 1 or Bla g 2), mouse (Mus m 1), cat (Fel d 1) and dog (Can f 1) allergens were measured in settled dust from kitchens or bedrooms, and concentrations were categorized according to previously published asthma symptom thresholds. We calculated odds ratios (OR) using logistic regression to identify those housing conditions and occupant behaviors that were associated with clinically significant allergen levels, after adjusting for numerous confounding variables., RESULTS: The adjusted results show that high cockroach allergen was associated with cracks or holes in walls (OR=2.1), high dust mite allergen was associated with mold odor (OR=2.5), housing built before 1951 (OR=2.1), and single-family home with slab on grade (OR=1.9); and mouse allergen was associated with rodent control or signs of rodents (OR=3.62) and inversely associated with presence of a cat (OR=0.20). Water leaks and below average housekeeping had unadjusted high odds ratios for high cockroach allergen., CONCLUSION: We have identified a number of housing conditions that are consistently associated with increased allergen dust concentrations. This study indicates that screening for housing-based asthma triggers should include presence of cats, dogs, cockroaches, or rodents; water leaks; mold or mold odor; holes or cracks in walls; and below average housekeeping. Single family houses that have basements or crawl spaces or are built before 1951 are also important predictors for increased allergens in housing. Copyright (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - RATIONALE: Asthma is the most common chronic respiratory disease in Canada. The estimates of risk of developing asthma may help researchers and health planners set research agendas, predict the burden of asthma on society, and target the at-risk population for asthma prevention, management, and control., OBJECTIVES: To estimate the lifetime risk of physician-diagnosed asthma., METHODS: All individuals aged 0-79 years living in Ontario, Canada on April 1, 1996 who had not been diagnosed with asthma were monitored for 11 years until March 31, 2007. They were censored when they were diagnosed with asthma, turned age 80 years, or died. The lifetime risk (from birth to age 79 yr) of physician-diagnosed asthma was calculated by a modified survival analysis technique. Results were stratified by sex, rurality, and neighborhood income., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Overall, the lifetime risk of physician-diagnosed asthma was 33.9%. Whereas the overall lifetime risk was higher in females (35.0 vs. 32.9%; P < 0.001), the cumulative risk was higher in males in early years. The lifetime risk was higher in individuals living in urban areas (34.5 vs. 30.1%; P < 0.001) or low-income neighborhoods (35.0% in the lowest income quintile vs. 32.2% in the highest; P < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Our estimated overall lifetime risk indicates that one of every three individuals in Ontario, Canada has physician-diagnosed asthma during one's lifetime.

N2  - The present birth cohort study investigated whether or not childhood wheeze and asthma are associated with parental exposure to occupational sensitisers that cause asthma. Parental occupation, from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), was related to wheeze, asthma, ventilatory function, airway responsiveness and atopic sensitisation in children aged 0-102 months. Occupation was recorded for 11,193 mothers and 9,473 fathers antenatally, and for 4,631 mothers and 5,315 fathers post-natally. Childhood respiratory outcomes were not associated with parental occupational exposure to diisocyanates, glues/resins, dyes, animal dust, solder, enzymes and wood dust. Maternal post-natal occupational exposure to latex and/or biocides/fungicides increased the likelihood of childhood wheeze and asthma. High levels of latex or biocide/fungicide exposure were associated with an OR (95% CI) of 1.26 (1.07-1.50) and 1.22 (1.02-2.05), respectively, for wheezing up to 81 months. Combined maternal latex and biocide/fungicide exposure increased the likelihood of childhood wheeze (1.22 (1.03-1.43)) and asthma. High paternal occupational flour dust exposure was associated with an increased likelihood of wheeze after 30 months (2.31 (1.05-5.10)) and asthma by 91 months (3.23 (1.34-7.79)). Maternal occupational exposure to latex and/or biocides and paternal exposure to flour dust increases the risk of childhood asthma. Further studies in this area are justified.

N2  - The further increase of allergies in industrialized countries demands evidence-based measures of primary prevention. The recommendations as published in the guideline of 2004 were updated and consented on the basis of a systematic literature search. Evidence from the period February 2003-May 2008 was searched in the electronic databases Cochrane and MEDLINE as well as in reference lists of recent reviews and by contacting experts. The retrieved citations were screened for relevance first by title and abstract and in a second step as full paper. Levels of evidence were assigned to each included study and the methodological quality of the studies was assessed as high or low. Finally the revised recommendations were formally consented (nominal group process) by representatives of relevant societies and organizations including a self-help group. Of originally 4556 hits, 217 studies (4 Cochrane Reviews, 14 meta-analyses, 19 randomized controlled trials, 135 cohort and 45 case-control studies) were included and critically appraised. Grossly unchanged remained the recommendations on avoiding environmental tobacco smoke, breast-feeding over 4 months (alternatively hypoallergenic formulas for children at risk), avoiding a mold-promoting indoor climate, vaccination according to current recommendations, and avoidance of furry pets (especially cats) in children at risk. The recommendation on reducing the house dust mite allergen exposure as a measure of primary prevention was omitted and the impact of a delayed introduction of supplementary food was reduced. New recommendations were adopted concerning fish consumption (during pregnancy / breast-feeding and as supplementary food in the first year), avoidance of overweight, and reducing the exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollutants. The revision of this guideline on a profound evidence basis led to (1) a confirmation of existing recommendations, (2) substantial revisions, and (3) new recommendations. Thereby it is possible to give evidence-based and up-to-date recommendations on primary prevention of allergies.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is a relationship in school aged children between wheezing and pneumonia prior, during, or following the pneumonia episode., PATIENTS-METHODS: One hundred and three children with community acquired pneumonia who were hospitalised were recruited along with 55 controls., RESULTS: During hospitalisation wheezing was audible in 11/103 (10.6%) patients with pneumonia and in none of the controls (p=0.009). Wheezing ever or asthma was elicited in 29/103(28%) patients with pneumonia and in 8/55 (14.5%) of the controls and this difference was not significant. Two years after the hospitalisation with pneumonia, wheezing episodes occurred in 12/103 with pneumonia and 1/55 of the controls (p=0.034). Among those who developed asthma following pneumonia 11/12 also had wheezing prior to pneumonia., CONCLUSION: There is an excess of wheezing prior, during, and after an episode of pneumonia in school aged children and therefore children with pneumonia should be followed up carefully.

N2  - Eosinophilic inflammation has a central role in the pathogenesis of asthma. We aimed to elucidate whether elevated blood eosinophil count (B-EOS), eosinophil cationic protein in serum (S-ECP) or in nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA-ECP) predict later asthma after hospitalization for wheezing in infancy. In 1992-1993, 100 infants aged <24 months were hospitalized for wheezing associated with respiratory infection. B-EOS, S-ECP and NPA-ECP were measured on admission. Asthma status was evaluated at the follow-up visits at the median ages of 4.0, 7.2 and 12.3 yr. Twenty (25%) of 81 children had asthma at all three visits and were considered to have persistent childhood asthma (PCA). Children with B-EOS >or= 0.450 x 10(9) cells/l had a 2.9-fold PCA risk compared with other children. The risk was 6.1-fold when S-ECP was >or=20.0 microg/l and 6.7-fold when NPA-ECP was >or=815.0 ng/g. By these cut-off limits, all these markers were specific (75-93%), but not very sensitive (30-58%) in predicting PCA. At least one marker was elevated in 75% of the children with PCA. The respective figure for NPA-ECP alone was 58%. In adjusted analyses, only elevated NPA-ECP was an independent risk factor for PCA (OR 4.09). In conclusion, eosinophil activity in early life predicts the development of childhood asthma after hospitalization for wheezing in infancy. The results highlight NPA-ECP as an independent predictor of the persistence of asthma at school age. Copyright (c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S

N2  - The study was aimed to determine the natural history of wheat hypersensitivity, to define risk factors for persistent wheat hypersensitivity, and to evaluate the development of respiratory allergy in children with wheat hypersensitivity. The development and subsequent disappearance of wheat hypersensitivity, clinical findings, skin prick test (SPT) reactivity, and the development of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma were charted retrospectively in 28 children with wheat hypersensitivity proven by the open oral challenge at the median age of 21 months (range 6 to 75 months). Appearance of skin symptoms during the diagnostic wheat challenge was related to SPT-positive wheat hypersensitivity, while the appearance of gastrointestinal symptoms alone was associated with SPT-negative wheat hypersensitivity (p=0.002). Wheat was tolerated by 59%, 69%, 84%, and 96%, by age 4, 6, 10, and 16, respectively. Sensitization to gliadin with a SPT wheal of >or=5 mm at the time of the diagnostic challenge was associated with a slower course of recovery from wheat hypersensitivity (p=0.019), and a SPT wheal of >or=3 mm to gliadin at any time was associated with the development of asthma (p=0.022). SPT reactivity to wheat was associated with later SPT reactivity to birch pollen (p=0.001), and the development of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (p=0.001). In conclusion, almost all children with wheat hypersensitivity can tolerate wheat by adolescence. Sensitization to gliadin is associated with a slower achievement of tolerance and an increased risk of asthma. Copyright (c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S

N2  - Like obesity, the prevalence of asthma has increased over the past several decades. Accelerated patterns of infant growth have been associated with obesity and its co-morbidities. We aimed to determine if infant weight gain pattern is associated with asthma development later in childhood. Birth weight, growth, pulmonary function, and symptom data were collected in a trial of 2- to 3-yr-old children at-risk for asthma randomized to a 2-yr treatment with inhaled corticosteroids or placebo followed by a 1-yr observation period of study medication. Patterns of infant weight gain between birth and study enrollment were categorized as accelerated, average, or decelerated. Regression analyses were used to test the effects of infant weight gain pattern prior to study enrollment on outcomes during the observation year and at study conclusion while adjusting for demographics, baseline symptom severity, study treatment, and atopic indicators. Among the 197 study participants, early life weight gain pattern was not associated with daily asthma symptoms or lung function at the study's conclusion. However, both prednisone courses (p = 0.01) and urgent physician visits (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with weight gain pattern with fewer exacerbations occurring amongst those with a decelerated weight gain pattern. We conclude that early life patterns of weight change were associated with subsequent asthma exacerbations, but were not associated with asthma symptoms or pulmonary function during the pre-school years for these children at-risk for asthma.

N2  - UNLABELLED: The authors present the results of retrospective epidemiological, clinical and laboratory diagnosis on toxocariasis cases hospitalized in the Pediatric Diseases Clinic of Iasi, between January 2005-June 2008., MATERIAL AND METHOD: The study included a number of 228 children., RESULTS: Respiratory manifestations were present in 184 children: 105 boys (46.05%) and 79 girls (34.64%), with a slight advance of the rural environment (44.29%). The age distribution highlighted a predominance of 1-5 years of age (65.76%). Respiratory manifestations were fever, coughing, wheezing, asthma, infections of respiratory pathways, pneumonia. The distribution of toxocariasis in children patients in Moldavia, Romania, highlighted a predominance in Iasi. The children with respiratory manifestations had hypereosinophilia associated with hyperleucocytosis. All the patients were serologically confirmed with toxocariasis. The children responded well to treatment with albendazole.

N2  - Sleep deprivation has become a common phenomenon of the Western world and is associated with a variety of medical problems in children. This retrospective longitudinal analysis of a community-based birth cohort was undertaken to determine whether frequent nocturnal awakening during early life was associated with the development of childhood asthma. 2,398 children born to mothers recruited from the antenatal clinics of a single hospital in Perth, Australia during 1989-1991 were followed up at years 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10 and 14. Parent-completed questionnaires were analysed. The odds ratio for asthma at age 6 and 14 yrs in children with frequent nocturnal awakening during the first 3 yrs after birth was determined from multiple logistic regression. Following adjustment for asthma risk factors, co-sleeping and family stress, persistent nocturnal awakening was associated with nonatopic asthma at age 6 and 14 yrs (at age 14 yrs: OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.15-4.13) but not with atopic asthma. We found an increased risk of nonatopic asthma in children following frequent nocturnal awakening during the first 3 yrs of life. These hypothesis-generating data suggest the need for further systematic study of the effects of disordered sleep in early life on the development of asthma.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The prevalences of asthma and obesity in children have increased significantly during the past 2 decades. The basis for the relationship between pediatric asthma and obesity is not well established., OBJECTIVES: To explore the association between obesity and asthma severity in children and adolescents and to test whether obesity-induced inflammation, as characterized by serum C-reactive protein (CRP), is associated with increased severity of asthma., METHODS: Retrospective cohort analysis of interview, physical examination, and laboratory test data from participants younger than 20 years in 2 rounds of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2001-2002 and 2003-2004). We also performed generalized ordered logistic regression to evaluate the effect of body mass index (BMI) z score and CRP level on asthma severity, controlling for the impact of age, sex, race, income, insurance, and tobacco smoke exposure., RESULTS: Of the 77 million individuals younger than 20 years represented by this weighted sample, 19% met the study-defined criteria for asthma; most cases were defined as mild (11%) or moderate (6%); 2% had severe asthma. In multivariable models, elevated BMI z scores (odds ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.21) were associated with worse asthma severity. Elevated CRP level was associated with obesity (P < .001) and asthma severity (odds ratio, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-1.52)., CONCLUSIONS: Higher BMI z scores and elevated serum CRP levels are associated with increased asthma severity. These findings highlight the importance of controlling for inflammation when considering the role of obesity and provide support for the hypothesis that obesity-induced inflammation may contribute to greater asthma severity.

T1  - Respiratory viruses in bronchiolitis and their link to recurrent wheezing and asthma.
A1  - Mansbach, Jonathan M
A1  - Camargo, Carlos A Jr
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Bronchiolitis is the leading cause of hospitalization for children younger than 1 year of age and these hospitalized children have an increased risk for developing childhood asthma. It remains unclear, however, which children who have severe bronchiolitis (eg, an episode requiring hospitalization) will develop recurrent wheezing or asthma. Although many environmental and genetic factors may play a role in the pathway from bronchiolitis to asthma, this article focuses on the viruses that have been linked to bronchiolitis and how these viruses may predict or contribute to future wheezing and asthma. The article also discusses vitamin D as an emerging risk factor for respiratory infections and wheezing.

T1  - Antibiotics and asthma in children.
A1  - Anonymous
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - (1) A longitudinal cohort study showed an increase in the frequency of asthma among 7-year-old children who were treated with antibiotics during the first year of life, even when treatment was for non-respiratory tract infections. The risk increased with the number of antibiotic courses with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics; (2) A meta-analysis of epidemiological studies showed that the risk of asthma doubled when antibiotics were administered during the first year of life. No such link was found in the combined analysis of the few existing prospective studies; (3) In practice, the likely benefits and risks should be carefully weighed before prescribing an antibiotic to a child. A narrow-spectrum antibiotic should be chosen whenever possible.

N1  - Comment in (CIN)
N2  - A full accounting of the excess burden of poor health in childhood must include any continuing loss of productivity over the life course. Including these costs results in a much higher estimate of the burden than focusing only on medical costs and other shorter-run costs to parents (such as lost work time). Policies designed to reduce this burden must go beyond increasing eligibility for health insurance, because disparities exist not only in access to health insurance but also in take-up of insurance, access to care, and the incidence of health conditions. We need to create a comprehensive safety net for young children that includes automatic eligibility for basic health coverage under Medicaid unless parents opt out by enrolling children in a private program; health and nutrition services for pregnant women and infants; quality preschool; and home visiting for infants and children at risk. Such a program is feasible and would be relatively inexpensive.

N2  - BACKGROUND: During the spring of 2009, a pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus emerged and spread globally. We describe the clinical characteristics of patients who were hospitalized with 2009 H1N1 influenza in the United States from April 2009 to mid-June 2009., METHODS: Using medical charts, we collected data on 272 patients who were hospitalized for at least 24 hours for influenza-like illness and who tested positive for the 2009 H1N1 virus with the use of a real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay., RESULTS: Of the 272 patients we studied, 25% were admitted to an intensive care unit and 7% died. Forty-five percent of the patients were children under the age of 18 years, and 5% were 65 years of age or older. Seventy-three percent of the patients had at least one underlying medical condition; these conditions included asthma; diabetes; heart, lung, and neurologic diseases; and pregnancy. Of the 249 patients who underwent chest radiography on admission, 100 (40%) had findings consistent with pneumonia. Of the 268 patients for whom data were available regarding the use of antiviral drugs, such therapy was initiated in 200 patients (75%) at a median of 3 days after the onset of illness. Data suggest that the use of antiviral drugs was beneficial in hospitalized patients, especially when such therapy was initiated early., CONCLUSIONS: During the evaluation period, 2009 H1N1 influenza caused severe illness requiring hospitalization, including pneumonia and death. Nearly three quarters of the patients had one or more underlying medical conditions. Few severe illnesses were reported among persons 65 years of age or older. Patients seemed to benefit from antiviral therapy. Copyright 2009 Massachusetts Medical Society

N2  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric asthma exacerbations may correlate with changes in weather, yet this relationship is not well defined., OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of fluctuations in climatic factors (temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure) on pediatric asthma exacerbations., METHODS: A retrospective study was performed at 1 large urban hospital during a 2-year period (January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2005). Children presenting to the emergency department (ED) for an asthma exacerbation were included. Data on climactic factors, pollutants, and aeroallergens were collected daily. The relationship of daily (intraday) or between-day (interday) changes in climactic factors and asthma ED visits was evaluated using time series analysis, controlling for seasonality, air pollution, and aeroallergen exposure. The effects of climactic factors were evaluated on the day of admission (T=0) and up to 5 days before admission (T-5 through T-1)., RESULTS: There were 25,401 asthma ED visits. A 10% intraday increase in humidity on day T-1 or day T-2 was associated with approximately 1 additional ED visit for asthma (P < .001 and P = .01, respectively). Interday changes in humidity from day T - 3 to T-2 were also associated with more ED visits (P < .001). Interday changes in temperature from T-1 to T = 0 increased ED visits, with a 10 degrees F increase being associated with 1.8 additional visits (P = .006). No association was found with changes in barometric pressure., CONCLUSION: Fluctuations in humidity and temperature, but not barometric pressure, appear to influence ED visits for pediatric asthma. The additional ED visits occur 1 to 2 days after the fluctuation.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Studies in urban emergency departments (EDs) have found poor quality of chronic asthma care and identified beliefs and barriers associated with low rates of follow-up with a primary care provider (PCP)., OBJECTIVES: To develop an ED-based intervention including asthma symptom screening, a video addressing beliefs and a mailed reminder; and measure the effect on PCP follow-up and asthma-related outcomes., METHODS: This randomized, controlled trial enrolled children aged 1 to 18 years who were discharged after asthma treatment in an urban pediatric ED. Control subjects received instructions to follow-up with a PCP within 3 to 5 days. In addition, intervention subjects (1) received a letter to take to their PCP if they screened positive for persistent asthma symptoms, (2) viewed a video featuring families and providers discussing the importance of asthma control, and (3) received a mailed reminder to follow-up with a PCP. All subjects were contacted by telephone 1, 3, and 6 months after the ED visit, and follow-up was confirmed by PCP record review. Asthma-related quality of life (AQoL), symptoms, and beliefs about asthma care were assessed by using validated surveys., RESULTS: A total of 433 subjects were randomly assigned, and baseline measures were similar between study groups. After the intervention and before ED discharge, intervention subjects were more likely to endorse beliefs about the benefits of follow-up than controls. However, rates of PCP follow-up during the month after the ED visit (44.5%) were similar to control subjects (43.8%) as were AQoL, medication use, and ED visits., CONCLUSIONS: An ED-based intervention influenced beliefs but did not increase PCP follow-up or asthma-related outcomes.

N2  - Difficult-to-control asthma is a disease that causes serious exacerbations, near-fatal attacks, frequent hospitalizations, and needs chronic use of high doses of inhaled corticosteroids or daily oral corticosteroid therapy. On the basis of epidemiological studies, the risk factors for serious asthma are: female gender, high BMI, sensitivity to aspirin, gastro esophageal reflux, sinusitis, pneumonia history, and beginning of asthma symptoms in adult late age. It has been found that in severe asthma the inflammatory profile commonly changes with major participation of neutrophils, and evidence of destruction and remodelling. The first step in the care of these patients is an evaluation to determine that asthma is the right diagnosis. A systematic and rigorous evaluation helps to asses adequately the differential diagnoses, the comorbilities and the unusual triggers. The aim of the treatment is to achieve the best results with minimum adverse effects. New immunomodulatory therapies are needed for these patients management.

N2  - Prevention of allergic diseases depends on early identification of clinical markers preceding such disorders. This study describes the natural course of sensitization as measured by skin prick test (SPT) and specific immunoglobulin E (S-IgE) and analyses the association between early sensitization patterns and subsequent allergic disease at 6 yr of age. In an ongoing population-based birth cohort study of 562 children, follow-up visits were performed at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36, and 72 months. Visits included an interview, physical examination, SPTs, and S-IgE measurements for 12 food and inhalant allergens. The frequency of S-IgE sensitization to > or = 1 inhalant allergen was constant from 0 to 6 months (9-10%), decreased at 12-18 months before increasing from 36 months onwards. S-IgE sensitization to at least one food allergen remained constant from 0 to 6 yr. SPT sensitization to food and inhalant allergens appeared from 3 and 12 months, respectively. Early food sensitization (S-IgE) between 3 and 18 months was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) associated with atopic dermatitis (OR: 4.0 [1.6-9.9]) and asthma (OR 4.0 [1.1-12.5]) at the age of 6 yr. Children with atopic dermatitis, asthma, or rhinoconjunctivitis, and sensitization at 6 yr, were sensitized to food allergens to a large extent (53%, 42%, and 47%, respectively) already at 6 months. Early inhalant sensitization (S-IgE) did not increase the risk of later allergic disease. Early atopic dermatitis (0-18 months) was also highly associated with subsequent allergic disease. Children with early food sensitization and/or atopic dermatitis would be a proper target group for future interventional studies.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To explore the association between obesity and asthma in US children and adolescents with adjustment of other structural and behavioral factors., METHOD: Prevalence and associated risk factors of asthma were explored in 102,273 children and adolescents in the National Survey of Children's Health (2003-2004). Subgroup analysis was performed for subjects of 0-6 year-old, 7-12 year-old, and 13-17 year-old. Crude and adjusted odds ratios for the potential risk factors were examined in univariate and multivariate logistic regressions., RESULTS: The overall prevalence of obesity was 24.5% and that of asthma was 12.5%. The adjusted odds ratio of asthma with obesity remains significantly bigger than 1 for children in the 7-12 and the 13-17 year-old age-groups. Gender and race were significantly associated with asthma in all age groups. The two parent family structure showed significant protectiveness against asthma with children in the 0-6 year-old age group. Poverty was positively associated with asthma in the 7-12 years old age group. Having a smoker in the household increased the odds of asthma by 29% and 23.5% in the 0-6 and 13-17 year-old age-groups, respectively. Higher education level of the parents and access to healthcare showed positive association with asthma in the 13-17 year-old age group., CONCLUSION: Gender and race were significantly associated with asthma. In the 13-17 year-old age-groups, obesity, household education level, healthcare coverage, and household smoking were positively associated with asthma. Further studies should characterize how the family structure and household education level influence childhood asthma in 0-6 and 13-17 year-old age-groups respectively.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether early child care exposure influences the risk for development of asthma., STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal data from 939 children and their families from the National Institute of Child Health and Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development were analyzed. Exposure to other children in the primary child care setting as an infant (before 15 months) and as a toddler (16-36 months) were assessed as risk factors for persistent or late-onset asthma by age 15 via logistic regression., RESULTS: The number of children in the child-care environment when the child was a toddler was significantly associated with odds of asthma, even after adjusting for respiratory illnesses and other risk factors (P < .05). The fewer the children exposed to as toddlers, the higher the probability of persistent or late-onset asthma by age 15., CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the theory of a protective effect of exposure to other children at an early age, especially as a toddler, on the risk of asthma. This effect appears to be independent of the number of reported respiratory tract illnesses, suggesting that other protective mechanisms related to the number of children in the child care environment may be involved.

N2  - Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is a significant risk factor for the presence and increased severity of asthma- and allergy-related symptoms in children. Smoking during pregnancy has detrimental effects on asthma-associated outcomes in childhood. Whether passive exposure of pregnant women to ETS may also lead to asthma in their offspring, is not known. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of passive exposure of pregnant women to ETS and asthma- and/or allergy-related symptoms in Preschool children. Cross-sectional data were collected with questionnaires from 2374 Preschool children, recruited from public and private nurseries and day-care centers. Parental smoking was significantly associated with wheezing symptoms in their children. Mother's active smoking during pregnancy significantly increased the risk for occurrence of asthma symptoms and/or medically diagnosed asthma in Preschool children in a dose-dependent manner. Passive exposure to ETS, mainly during the third trimester of pregnancy, was significantly associated with asthma- and allergy-related symptoms after adjusting for several confounders in a multivariate analysis (current wheeze: OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.06-1.91, pruritic rash ever: OR= 1.45, 95% CI = 1.01-2.08). Passive exposure of pregnant women to ETS during the third trimester is positively associated with asthma- and allergy-related symptoms in their Preschool age children. Public health policies should be oriented not only towards smoking cessation, but also reinforce elimination of ETS exposure of pregnant women.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir in treatment of children with seasonal influenza and prevention of transmission to children in households., DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of data from published and unpublished randomised controlled trials., DATA SOURCES: Medline and Embase to June 2009, trial registries, and manufacturers and authors of relevant studies. Review methods Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials of neuraminidase inhibitors in children aged </=12 in the community (that is, not admitted to hospital) with confirmed or clinically suspected influenza. Primary outcome measures were time to resolution of illness and incidence of influenza in children living in households with index cases of influenza., RESULTS: We identified four randomised trials of treatment of influenza (two with oseltamivir, two with zanamivir) involving 1766 children (1243 with confirmed influenza, of whom 55-69% had influenza A), and three randomised trials for postexposure prophylaxis (one with oseltamivir, two with zanamivir) involving 863 children; none of these trials tested efficacy with the current pandemic strain. Treatment trials showed reductions in median time to resolution of symptoms or return to normal activities, or both, of 0.5-1.5 days, which were significant in only two trials. A 10 day course of postexposure prophylaxis with zanamivir or oseltamivir resulted in an 8% (95% confidence interval 5% to 12%) decrease in the incidence of symptomatic influenza. Based on only one trial, oseltamivir did not reduce asthma exacerbations or improve peak flow in children with asthma. Treatment was not associated with reduction in overall use of antibiotics (risk difference -0.30, -0.13 to 0.01). Zanamivir was well tolerated, but oseltamivir was associated with an increased risk of vomiting (0.05, 0.02 to 0.09, number needed to harm=20)., CONCLUSIONS: Neuraminidase inhibitors provide a small benefit by shortening the duration of illness in children with seasonal influenza and reducing household transmission. They have little effect on asthma exacerbations or the use of antibiotics. Their effects on the incidence of serious complications, and on the current A/H1N1 influenza strain remain to be determined.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Clinicians have difficulty in diagnosing asthma in preschool children with suggestive symptoms., OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop a clinical asthma prediction score for preschool children who have asthma-like symptoms for the first time., METHODS: The Prevalence and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy birth cohort followed 3,963 children for 8 years. Between 0 and 4 years of age, 2,171 (55%) children reported "wheezing," "coughing at night without a cold," or both. In these children possible predictor variables for asthma were assessed at the age respiratory symptoms were first reported. Asthma was defined as wheezing, inhaled steroid prescription, or a doctor's diagnosis of asthma at both age 7 and 8 years of age., RESULTS: Eleven percent of children with symptoms at 0 to 4 years of age had asthma at 7 to 8 years of age. Eight clinical parameters independently predicted asthma at 7 to 8 years of age: male sex, postterm delivery, parental education and inhaled medication, wheezing frequency, wheeze/dyspnea apart from colds, respiratory infections, and eczema. In 72% of the cases, the model accurately discriminated between asthmatic and nonasthmatic children. A clinical risk score was developed (range, 0-55 points). Symptomatic children with a score of less than 10 points had a 3% risk, whereas children with a score of 30 points or greater had a 42% risk of asthma., CONCLUSION: A risk score based on 8 readily available clinical parameters at the time preschool children first reported asthma-like symptoms predicted the risk of asthma at 7 to 8 years of age.

N2  - Forest fires burned near the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation in northern California from late August until early November in 1999. The fires generated particulate matter reaching hazardous levels. We assessed the relationship between patients seeking care for six health conditions and PM(10) exposure levels during the 1999 fires and during the corresponding period in 1998 when there were no fires. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that daily PM(10) levels in 1999 were significant predictors for patients seeking care for asthma, coronary artery disease and headache after controlling for potential risk factors. Stratified multivariate logistic regression models indicated that daily PM(10) levels in 1999 were significant predictors for patients seeking care for circulatory illness among residents of nearby communities and new patients, and for respiratory illness among residents of Hoopa and those of nearby communities.

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe what is currently known about the role of virus vaccines in the pathogenesis of asthma and atopy and summarize their role in the prevention of morbidity due to childhood asthma., RECENT FINDINGS: The development of virus vaccines and their incorporation into infant and childhood immunization programmes over the last few decades of the twentieth century have been accompanied by a striking concomitant rise in the incidence of asthma and atopy. However, a causal relationship is not supported by the majority of observational studies. The role of childhood immunization against respiratory viruses in the reduction of morbidity from asthma is another important public health issue. Recent findings suggest that influenza is not strongly associated with exacerbations of asthma in children, despite recommendations that this group should be immunized against it., SUMMARY: Current evidence suggests that virus vaccination is well tolerated and does not lead to an increased incidence of asthma or atopy in children receiving vaccines. Debate continues regarding the place of respiratory virus vaccination in the therapeutic armamentarium for children with asthma. In the case of influenza, there appears to be an absence of harm, but benefit seems to be limited to younger children.

N2  - One of more frequent reasons for hospitalizations concerning infants and small children are obstructive bronchitis. Great prevalence of bronchial tree obturation during infancy and in small children is a result of anatomical and functional differences of airways and immunological differences that occur in infants and small children. The most frequent cause of bronchial tree obturation is infection induced by viruses, rarely by bacteria. Recurrences of bronchial tree obturation are observed in some patients. Obturation recurrences can be caused by number of diseases that appear during infancy and in small children, for example cystic fibrosis of the pancreas. Also the presence of foreign body in the airways, immotile cilia syndrome, immunological disturbances, innate anomalies of the respiratory system and the circulatory system and bronchial asthma can result in obturation recurrences. Various clinical criteria are established and new markers of allergic inflammation are searched in view of difficulties to diagnose bronchial asthma in the youngest children. There are no unequivocal rules to diagnose bronchial asthma in infants and small children despite these searches.

T1  - Is the association between low birth weight and asthma independent of genetic and shared environmental factors?.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Epidemiologic evidence linking birth weight and asthma is inconsistent. The authors examined the association between birth weight and asthma during childhood and adult life in twins. Using prospectively collected data on 21,588 like-sexed Swedish twins of known zygosity born in 1928-1952, they first conducted a cohort study to examine the risk of asthma in relation to birth weight. Next, they conducted nested co-twin control analyses among 643 dizygotic and 365 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for asthma to ascertain whether the association between birth weight and asthma could be confounded by genetic and shared environmental exposures. In the cohort analysis, birth weight of <2,500 g was associated with significantly greater risk of asthma independent of perinatal characteristics and within-twin-pair correlations. In the co-twin control analyses, birth weight of <2,500 g was significantly related to increased risk of asthma among monozygotic twins (relative risk for 2,000 g vs. 2,500 g = 1.58, 95% confidence interval: 1.06, 2.38). A negative association between birth weight and asthma, albeit not statistically significant, was also found among dizygotic twins. In conclusion, there is a negative association between birth weight and asthma in twins that is unlikely to be confounded by genetic or shared environmental factors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Asthma prediction in early infancy is essential for the development of new preventive strategies. Loss-of-function mutations in the filaggrin gene (FLG) were identified as risk factors for eczema and associated asthma., OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the utility of the FLG mutations for the prediction of asthma., METHODS: Eight hundred seventy-one individuals of the prospective German Multicenter Allergy Study cohort were genotyped for 3 FLG mutations. Information on asthma, eczema, and food sensitization was available from birth to 13 years of age. Pulmonary function was measured from 7 to 13 years of age. The predictive value of the FLG mutations and of atopic phenotypes in infancy was assessed for asthma., RESULTS: In infants with eczema and sensitization to food allergens, the FLG mutations predicted childhood asthma with a positive predictive value of 100% (95% CI, 65.5% to 100%). This subgroup was characterized by a significant decrease in pulmonary function until puberty and represented 8.1% of all asthmatic children and 19.1% of patients with asthma after infantile eczema. We found a strong synergistic interaction between the FLG-null alleles and early food sensitization in the disease transition from eczema to asthma (relative excess risk due to interaction, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.70-3.98; P = .00040)., CONCLUSION: FLG mutations and food sensitization represent 2 distinct mechanisms interacting in the pathogenesis of asthma. In infants with eczema and food sensitization, genotyping of the FLG mutations allows the prediction of asthma before the onset of symptoms. Our findings might facilitate the development of early subgroup-specific interventions to prevent the progression from eczema to asthma.

N2  - Data collected from the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY) in 1994/95 and 1996/97 were used to measure longitudinal health outcomes among children with asthma. Over 10 000 children aged 1 to 11 years with complete data on asthma status in both years were included. Outcomes included hospitalizations and health services use (HSU). Current asthma was defined as children diagnosed with asthma by a physician and who took prescribed inhalants regularly, had wheezing or an attack in the previous year, or had their activities limited by asthma. Children having asthma significantly increased their odds of hospitalization (OR = 2.52; 95% CI: 1.71, 3.70) and health services use (OR = 3.80; 95% CI: 2.69, 5.37). Low-income adequacy (LIA) in 1994/ 95 significantly predicts hospitalization and HSU in 1996/97 (OR = 2.68; 95% CI: 1.29, 5.59 and OR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.99, respectively). Our results confirmed that both having current asthma and living in low-income families had a significant impact on the health status of children in Canada. Programs seeking to decrease the economic burden of pediatric hospitalizations need to focus on asthma and low-income populations.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic exposure in early childhood is a possible contributor to the increasing asthma prevalence in industrialized countries. Although a number of published studies have tested this hypothesis, the results have been conflicting., OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between antibiotic exposure before 1 year of age and development of childhood asthma., METHODS: Using administrative data, birth cohorts from 1997 to 2003 were evaluated (N = 251817). Antibiotic exposure was determined for the first year of life. After the first 24 months of life, the incidence of asthma was determined in both those exposed and not exposed to antibiotics in the first 12 months of life. Cox proportional hazards models were used to adjust for potential confounders and determine the hazard ratios associated with antibiotic exposure for the development of asthma., RESULTS: Antibiotic exposure in the first year of life was associated with a small risk of developing asthma in early childhood after adjusting for gender, socioeconomic status at birth, urban or rural address at birth, birth weight, gestational age, delivery method, frequency of physician visits, hospital visit involving surgery, visits to an allergist, respirologist, or immunologist, congenital anomalies, and presence of otitis media, acute, or chronic bronchitis, and upper and lower respiratory tract infections during the first year of life. As the number of courses of antibiotics increased, this was associated with increased asthma risk, with the highest risk being in children who received >4 courses. All antibiotics were associated with an increased risk of developing asthma, with the exception of sulfonamides., CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that the use of antibiotics in the first year of life is associated with a small risk of developing asthma, and this risk increases with the number of courses of antibiotics prescribed.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the contribution of polymorphisms in the positionally cloned asthma candidate genes ADAM33, PHF11, DPP10, GPRA and PTGDR to the risk of asthma, total and specific immunoglobulin E level, lung function and wheezing in a large, nationally representative, population., METHODS: An association analysis was undertaken using genotype data for tagging and previously associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in regions of these genes and longitudinal phenotype data from singletons of white ethnicity in the British 1958 Birth Cohort DNA archive (n = 7703). Population-attributable risk fractions for SNPs showing association were calculated., RESULTS: Polymorphisms producing small but statistically significant increases in asthma risk (OR 1.1 per allele) were identified in DPP10 and ADAM33, with the strongest evidence being for SNPs tagging the DPP10 gene. No individual SNP in any gene under study markedly increased risk for any of the phenotypes in the population studied., CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that DPP10 and ADAM33 influence asthma risk in the UK population. However, the effects driven by any given locus are small, and genotyping of multiple polymorphisms in many genes will be needed to define a full genetic profile for disease risk.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Aggregate hospital encounters for asthma (admissions or emergency department visits) have been associated with daily regional air pollution. There are fewer data on relationships between repeated hospital encounters and traffic-related air pollution near the home., OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association of local traffic-generated air pollution with repeated hospital encounters for asthma in children., METHODS: Hospital records for 2,768 children aged 0 to 18 years (697 of whom had > or = 2 encounters) were obtained for a catchment area of 2 hospitals in northern Orange County, California. Residential addresses were geocoded. A line source dispersion model was used to estimate individual seasonal exposures to local traffic-generated pollutants (nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide) longitudinally beginning with the first hospital encounter. Recurrent proportional hazards analysis was used to estimate risk of exposure to air pollution adjusting for sex, age, health insurance, census-derived poverty, race/ethnicity, residence distance to hospital, and season. The adjustment variables and census-derived median household income were tested for effect modification., RESULTS: Adjusted hazard ratios for interquartile range increases in nitrogen oxides (4.00 ppb) and carbon monoxide (0.056 ppm) were 1.10 (95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.16) and 1.07 (1.01-1.14), respectively. Associations were strongest for girls and infants but were not significantly different from other groups. Stronger associations in children from higher-income block groups (P < .09 for trend) may have been due to more accurate data., CONCLUSIONS: Associations for repeated hospital encounters suggest that locally generated air pollution near the home affects asthma severity in children. Risk may begin during infancy and continue in later childhood, when asthma diagnoses are clearer.

N2  - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data were used to describe 1980-2007 trends among children 0 to 17 years of age and recent patterns according to gender, race, and age. Asthma period prevalence increased by 4.6% per year from 1980 to 1996. New measures introduced in 1997 show a plateau at historically high levels; 9.1% of US children (6.7 million) currently had asthma in 2007. Ambulatory care visit rates fluctuated during the 1990 s, whereas emergency department visits and hospitalization rates decreased slightly. Asthma-related death rates increased through the middle 1990 s but decreased after 1999. Recent data showed higher prevalence among older children (11-17 years), but the highest rates of asthma-related health care use were among the youngest children (0-4 years). After controlling for racial differences in prevalence, disparities in adverse outcomes remained; among children with asthma, non-Hispanic black children had greater risks for emergency department visits and death, compared with non-Hispanic white children. For hospitalizations, for which Hispanic ethnicity data were not available, black children had greater risk than white children. However, nonemergency ambulatory care use was lower for non-Hispanic black children. Although the large increases in childhood asthma prevalence have abated, the burden remains large. Potentially avoidable adverse outcomes and racial disparities continue to present challenges. These findings suggest the need for sustained asthma prevention and control efforts for children.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The atopic march is well documented, but the interrelationship of food allergy (FA) and asthma is not well understood., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the strength of the association and temporal relationships between FA and asthma., METHODS: This analysis included 271 children >or=6 years (older group) and 296 children <6 years (younger group) from a family-based FA cohort in Chicago, IL. Asthma was determined by parental report of physician diagnosis. FA status was determined based on the type and timing of clinical symptoms after ingestion of a specific food, and results of prick skin test (Multi-Test II) and allergen-specific IgE (Phadia ImmunoCAP). Analyses were carried out using logistic regression accounting for important covariates and auto-correlations among siblings. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to compare the time to onset of asthma with the FA status., RESULTS: Symptomatic FA was associated with asthma in both older [odds ratio (OR)=4.9, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.5-9.5] and younger children (OR=5.3, 95% CI: 1.7-16.2). The association was stronger among children with multiple or severe food allergies, especially in older children. Children with FA developed asthma earlier and at higher prevalence than children without FA (Cox proportional hazard ratio=3.7, 95% CI: 2.2-6.3 for children >or=6 years, and hazard ratio=3.3, 95% CI: 1.1-10 for children <6 years of age). No associations were seen between asymptomatic food sensitization and asthma., CONCLUSIONS: Independent of markers of atopy such as aeroallergen sensitization and family history of asthma, there was a significant association between FA and asthma. This association was even stronger in subjects with multiple food allergies or severe FA.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Access to primary care is often a problem for children living in urban areas and the rate of emergency department (ED) use can be high. For acute childhood illnesses, primary care follow-up is often recommended to prevent subsequent ED visits., METHODS: We conducted an observational study of 455 children with common childhood illnesses, between 6 weeks and 8 years of age, presenting to 1 of 3 EDs, and discharged to the community. ED physicians recommended that the child visit their primary care physician within 1 to 4 days of discharge (ie, "short-term" follow-up). Caregivers were surveyed during the ED index visit and after discharge to assess primary care follow-up adherence. We collected data on child and caregiver characteristics, type and severity of illness at the ED index visit, and ED return visits in the 2-month period after the ED index visit., RESULTS: A total of 45.3% of caregivers adhered to short-term primary care follow-up. Short-term follow-up adherence was associated with greater ED use for the same illness over the subsequent 2 months (odds ratio = 2.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.31-6.72). Subsequent ED use was greatest for children with short-term primary care follow-up and: (1) prior ED use, (2) single caregivers, (3) mild severity illnesses at the ED index visit, or (4) younger children. ED use after the initial visit did not vary by type of illness or site., CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence that primary care follow-up soon after an ED visit was associated with a lower rate of subsequent ED use for common pediatric illnesses.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Recent data in mice suggest that acid suppression during pregnancy yields offspring with type 2 T helper-dominant immunity, suggesting a predisposition for allergy., OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of in utero exposure to acid-suppressive medications and the subsequent development of allergic diseases in children., METHODS: We studied a population-based observational cohort formed by linking data from three Swedish national healthcare registers: the Medical Birth Register, the Hospital Discharge Register, and the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register. Main outcome measures included a hospital discharge diagnosis of an allergic disease or prescription for asthma medications, epinephrine auto-injectors, antihistamines or steroid ointments in children. Data were analysed using the Mantel-Haenszel procedure., RESULTS: Twenty-nine thousand four hundred and ninety (5.03%) children had a discharge diagnosis of allergy or prescriptions for allergy medications. Five thousand six hundred and forty-five (0.96%) children had been exposed to acid suppression therapy during pregnancy; of these, 405 (0.07%) were treated for allergic diseases. Exposure to acid-suppressive medications in utero was associated with an increased odds ratio (OR) for developing allergy (OR 1.43, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.29-1.59). We observed this association irrespective of the type of drug, time of exposure during pregnancy, and maternal history of allergy. The use of maternal acid-suppressive medication was associated with an increased OR for the development of childhood asthma (3.7% in the population at large vs. 5.6% in exposed children, OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.35-1.69), but not for other allergic diseases., CONCLUSION: These data provide first evidence of a significant association between in utero exposure to acid-suppressive drugs and the risk of developing childhood asthma.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Earlier studies have reported an increased risk of asthma after respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospitalization. Other studies found that asthmatic disposition and propensity to wheeze increase the risk of RSV hospitalization., OBJECTIVE: The current study examined the causal direction of the associations between RSV hospitalization and asthma in a population-based cohort of twins., METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study examining the associations between RSV hospitalization and asthma by using registry information on RSV hospitalization and asthma among 18,614 Danish twins born 1994 to 2003. The associations between RSV and asthma were examined in both directions: we examined the risk of asthma after RSV hospitalization, and the risk of RSV hospitalization in children with asthma in the same population-based cohort., RESULTS: Asthma hospitalization after RSV hospitalization was increased as much as 6-fold to 8-fold during the first 2 months after RSV hospitalization but was no longer increased 1 year later. Asthma increased the risk of RSV hospitalization by 3-fold, and the risk was not time-dependent. Analyzing these associations on the basis of asthma defined from use of inhaled corticosteroid did not materially change the risk estimates., CONCLUSION: There is a bidirectional association between severe RSV infection and asthma. Severe RSV infection is associated with a short-term increase in the risk of subsequent asthma, suggesting that RSV induce bronchial hyperresponsiveness; and asthma is associated with a long-term increased susceptibility for severe RSV disease, suggesting a host factor being responsible for the severe response to RSV infection. This suggests that severe RSV infection and asthma may share a common genetic predisposition and/or environmental exposure.

N2  - RATIONALE: An asthma predisposition locus on chromosome 17q12-q21 has recently been replicated in different ethnic groups., OBJECTIVES: To characterize the asthma and atopy phenotypes in early childhood that associate with the 17q12-21 locus., METHODS: The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs7216389, was genotyped in 376 of 411 children from the Copenhagen Prospective Study on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC) birth cohort born to mothers with asthma together with 305 mothers and 224 fathers. Nineteen additional SNPs in the region were genotyped in the children. Investigator-diagnosed clinical endpoints were based on diary cards and clinic visits every 6 months and at acute symptoms from birth. Lung function, bronchial responsiveness, and sensitization were tested longitudinally from early infancy., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: rs7216389 was significantly associated with the development of wheeze (hazard ratio 1.64 [1.05-2.59], P value = 0.03), asthma (hazard ratio, 1.88 [1.15-3.07], P = 0.01), and acute severe exacerbations (hazard ratio 2.66 [1.58-4.48], P value = 0.0002). The effect on wheeze and asthma was observed for early onset but not late onset of disease. The increased risk of exacerbations persisted from 1 to 6 years of age (incidence ratio 2.48 [1.42-4.32], P value = 0.001), and increased bronchial responsiveness was present in infancy and at 4 years of age, but not at 6 years. In contrast, rs7216389 conferred no risk of eczema, rhinitis, or allergic sensitization., CONCLUSIONS: Variation at the chromosome 17q12-q21 locus was associated with approximately twofold increased risk of recurrent wheeze, asthma, asthma exacerbations, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness from early infancy to school age but without conferring risk of eczema, rhinitis, or allergic sensitization. These longitudinal clinical data show this locus to be an important genetic determinant of nonatopic asthma in children.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Air pollution triggers asthma attacks hours to days after exposure. It remains unclear whether socioeconomic deprivation modulates these effects. Investigation of these interactions requires adequate statistical power, obtainable by using either a sufficient number of observations or very sensitive indicators of asthma attacks. Using a small-area temporal ecologic approach, we studied the short-term relations between ambient air pollution and sales of short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) drugs, a frequent and specific treatment for control of asthma attacks in children and young adults, and then tested the influence of deprivation on these relations., METHODS: The study took place in Strasbourg, France in 2004. Health insurance funds provided data on 15,121 SABA sales for patients aged 0 to 39 years. Deprivation was estimated by small geographic areas using an index constructed from census data. Daily average ambient concentrations of particulate matter (particles with an aerodynamic diameter < 10 microm [PM(10)]), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), and ozone (O(3)) were modeled on a small-area level. Adjusted case-crossover models were used for statistical analysis., RESULTS: Increased of 10 microg/m(3) in ambient PM(10), NO(2), and O(3) concentrations were associated, respectively, with increases of 7.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4 to 11.2%), 8.4% (95% CI, 5 to 11.9%), and 1% (95% CI, - 0.3 to 2.2%) in SABA sales. Deprivation had no influence on these relations., CONCLUSION: The associations observed are consistent with those reported by studies focusing on SABA use. Similar studies in other settings should confirm whether the lack of interaction with deprivation is due to specific local conditions.

N2  - RATIONALE: Asthma is associated with increased airway responsiveness (AR), but the age when this relationship becomes established is not clear. The present study tested the hypothesis that the association between increased AR and asthma is established after 1 month of age., OBJECTIVES: To relate AR in infancy to asthma in childhood., METHODS: As part of a birth cohort study, AR was determined at 1 (early infancy), 6 (mid-infancy), and 12 months of age (late infancy). At 11 years of age (childhood), AR and the presence of asthma symptoms were determined., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 253 study subjects enrolled, AR was determined in 202 in early infancy, 174 in mid-infancy, 147 in late infancy, and 176 in childhood. Increased AR in late infancy, but not in early or mid-infancy, was associated with increased wheeze at 11 years of age (P = 0.016). Increased AR in infancy persisted into childhood in association with male gender, early respiratory illness, and maternal smoking and asthma. Among the 116 subjects assessed in late infancy and childhood, recent wheeze was present in 35% of children with increased AR at both ages, 13% with increased AR in childhood only, 12% for those with increased AR in late infancy only, and 0% for those who did not have increased AR at either age (P = 0.023); the proportions of children with diagnosed asthma in the corresponding groups were 27, 20, 12, and 0% (P = 0.038)., CONCLUSIONS: The association between increased infantile AR and childhood asthma emerges at the end of the first year of life.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - The objective of this study was to estimate prevalence of asthma and asthma attacks among youth (0-19 years old) working and/or living on Hispanic-operated farms. The 2000 U.S. Minority Farm Operator Childhood Agricultural Injury Survey (M-CAIS) data were used to calculate prevalence of asthma, asthma attacks and serious asthma attacks among youth (0 to 19 years) living on Hispanic-operated farms. Age-specific asthma prevalence rates with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for working and nonworking youth. In 2000, an estimated 17,573 youth lived on Hispanic-operated farms; 7.4% had asthma ever diagnosed, 8.1% had an asthma attack while at work in the last year, and 1.4% had a serious asthma attack. Asthma prevalence was highest among youth aged 16-19 (9.1%), males (8.6%), and those driving tractors (9.7%). Serious asthma attacks that required an emergency room visit or hospitalization in the last year were most prevalent among youth aged 0-9 years (1.8%), males (1.7%), and those riding horses (1.7%). Compared with nonworking youth, prevalence of asthma (8.9% versus 6.1%; p < .05) and serious asthma attacks (1.6% versus 1.3%; p > .05) was higher among working youth. Prevalence of asthma attacks in the last year while at work was also significantly higher among males than females (8.6% versus 6.0%; p < .05) and among youth living on livestock farms than among youth on crop farms (9.4% versus 7.4%; p < .05). These findings contribute to the limited information on asthma among youth working on Hispanic-operated farms, and indicate the need for asthma prevention programs on farms and intervention studies targeting farming youth populations.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Among patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) evaluated in our clinic, there appears to be a subset that can be clinically distinguished from other ASD children because of frequent infections (usually viral) accompanied by worsening behavioural symptoms and/or loss/decrease in acquired skills. This study assessed whether these clinical features of this ASD subset are associated with atopy, asthma, food allergy (FA), primary immunodeficiency (PID), or innate immune responses important in viral infections., METHODS: This study included the ASD children described above (ASD test, N = 26) and the following controls: ASD controls (N = 107), non-ASD controls with FA (N = 24), non-ASD controls with chronic rhinosinusitis/recurrent otitis media (CRS/ROM; N = 38), and normal controls (N = 43). We assessed prevalence of atopy, asthma, FA, CRS/ROM, and PID. Innate immune responses were assessed by measuring production of proinflammatory and counter-regulatory cytokines by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in response to agonists of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), with or without pre-treatment of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a TLR4 agonist., RESULTS: Non-IgE mediated FA was equally prevalent in both ASD test and ASD control groups, occurring at higher frequency than in the non-ASD controls. Allergic rhinitis, atopic/non-atopic asthma, and atopic dermatitis were equally prevalent among the study groups except for the CRS/ROM group in which non-atopic asthma was more prevalent (52.6%). CRS/ROM and specific polysaccharide antibody deficiency (SPAD) were more prevalent in the ASD test group than in the ASD control, FA, and normal control groups: 23.1% vs. < 5% for CRS/ROS and 19.2% vs. < 1% for SPAD. However, CRS/ROM patients had the highest prevalence of SPAD (34.2%). When compared to ASD and normal case controls, PBMCs from 19 non-SPAD, ASD test group children produced: 1) less IL-1beta with a TLR7/8 agonist, less IL-10 with a TLR2/6 agonist, and more IL-23 with a TLR4 agonist without LPS pre-treatment, and 2) less IL-1beta with TLR4/7/8 agonists with LPS pre-treatment. These are cytokines associated with the neuro-immune network., CONCLUSION: Clinical features of the ASD test group were not associated with atopy, asthma, FA, or PID in our study but may be associated with altered TLR responses mediating neuro-immune interactions.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate a) whether childhood adversity predicts adult-onset asthma; b) whether early-onset depressive/anxiety disorders predict adult-onset asthma; and c) whether childhood adversity and early-onset depressive/anxiety disorders predict adult-onset asthma independently of each other. Previous research has suggested, but not established, that childhood adversity may predict adult-onset asthma and, moreover, that the association between mental disorders and asthma may be a function of shared risk factors, such as childhood adversity., METHODS: Ten cross-sectional population surveys of household-residing adults (>18 years, n = 18,303) assessed mental disorders with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3.0) as part of the World Mental Health surveys. Assessment of a range of childhood family adversities was included. Asthma was ascertained by self-report of lifetime diagnosis and age of diagnosis. Survival analyses calculated hazard ratios (HRs) for risk of adult-onset (>age 20 years) asthma as a function of number and type of childhood adversities and early-onset (<age 21 years) depressive and anxiety disorders, adjusting for current age, sex, country, education, and current smoking., RESULTS: Childhood adversities predicted adult-onset asthma with risk increasing with the number of adversities experienced (HRs = 1.49-1.71). Early-onset depressive and anxiety disorders also predicted adult-onset asthma (HRs = 1.67-2.11). Childhood adversities and early-onset depressive and anxiety disorders both predicted adult-onset asthma after mutual adjustment (HRs = 1.43-1.91)., CONCLUSIONS: Childhood adversities and early-onset depressive/anxiety disorders independently predict adult-onset asthma, suggesting that the mental disorder-asthma relationship is not a function of a shared background of childhood adversity.

N2  - Epidemiologic and clinical evidence suggests that respiratory tract infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae maybe implicated in the initiation and exacerbation of asthma. This study examines the incidence and frequency of M. pneumoniae infection in children and evaluates the serum cytokine profile and total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in a subgroup of patients with clinical presentation of either upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) or lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). A total of 6986 serum samples were tested for specific IgM anti-M. pneumoniae, and a 4-year cyclical incidence of M. pneumoniae infection was confirmed; however; the peak age of highest incidence in the most recent epidemic fell to 3-4 years. A high incidence was also observed in the 6-7-year age group. Children presenting with LRTI, when compared with those patients presenting with URTI, had significantly higher serum levels of the proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-6, the T-helper (Th)2-type cytokines, and IL-4 and IL-10. The Th1-type cytokines, IL-2 and IL-12, were within the normal range, whereas interferon-gamma levels were slightly raised. Total serum immunoglobulin E levels were significantly higher in the LRTI group (p < 0.02). Our findings support the emerging evidence that respiratory tract infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae results in an increased proinflammatory and Th2-type cytokine response that may precede the initiation and exacerbation of asthma.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Exposure to paracetamol during intrauterine life, childhood, and adult life may increase the risk of developing asthma. We studied 6-7-year-old children from Phase Three of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) programme to investigate the association between paracetamol consumption and asthma., METHODS: As part of Phase Three of ISAAC, parents or guardians of children aged 6-7 years completed written questionnaires about symptoms of asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, and eczema, and several risk factors, including the use of paracetamol for fever in the child's first year of life and the frequency of paracetamol use in the past 12 months. The primary outcome variable was the odds ratio (OR) of asthma symptoms in these children associated with the use of paracetamol for fever in the first year of life, as calculated by logistic regression., FINDINGS: 205 487 children aged 6-7 years from 73 centres in 31 countries were included in the analysis. In the multivariate analyses, use of paracetamol for fever in the first year of life was associated with an increased risk of asthma symptoms when aged 6-7 years (OR 1.46 [95% CI 1.36-1.56]). Current use of paracetamol was associated with a dose-dependent increased risk of asthma symptoms (1.61 [1.46-1.77] and 3.23 [2.91-3.60] for medium and high use vs no use, respectively). Use of paracetamol was similarly associated with the risk of severe asthma symptoms, with population-attributable risks between 22% and 38%. Paracetamol use, both in the first year of life and in children aged 6-7 years, was also associated with an increased risk of symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema., INTERPRETATION: Use of paracetamol in the first year of life and in later childhood, is associated with risk of asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, and eczema at age 6 to 7 years. We suggest that exposure to paracetamol might be a risk factor for the development of asthma in childhood.

N2  - RATIONALE: Bronchiolitis during infancy is associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma. Whether winter viral infections cause asthma or are a manifestation of a predisposition to asthma development is unknown., OBJECTIVES: To study the relationship of winter virus infection during infancy and the development of childhood asthma., METHODS: We studied over 95,000 infants born between 1995 and 2000 and followed through 2005 who were enrolled in the Tennessee Medicaid program from birth through early childhood to determine whether infant birth in relationship to the winter virus peak alters the risk of developing early childhood asthma., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 95,310 children studied during five winter virus seasons from birth through early childhood, the risk of developing asthma tracked with the timing of infant birth in relationship to the winter virus peak. Infant birth approximately 4 months before the winter virus peak carried the highest risk, with a 29% increase in odds of developing asthma compared with birth 12 months before the peak (adjusted odds ratio, 1.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-1.40). Infant age at the winter virus peak was comparable to or greater than other known risk factors for asthma., CONCLUSIONS: Timing of birth in relationship to winter virus season confers a differential and definable risk of developing early childhood asthma, establishing winter virus seasonality as a causal factor in asthma development. Delay of exposure or prevention of winter viral infection during early infancy could prevent asthma.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Exposure to n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in early life is hypothesized to offer protection against atopic disease. However, there is controversy in this area, and we have previously observed that high levels of n-3 fatty acid (FA) in colostrum are associated with increased risk of allergic sensitization., OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between FA profile in breast milk and risk of childhood atopic disease., METHODS: A high-risk birth cohort was recruited, and a total of 224 mothers provided a sample of colostrum (n=194) and/or 3-month expressed breast milk (n=118). FA concentrations were determined by gas chromatography. Presence of eczema, asthma and rhinitis were prospectively documented up to 7 years of age., RESULTS: High levels of n-3 22:5 FA (docosapentaenoic acid, DPA) in colostrum were associated with increased risk of infantile atopic eczema [odds ratio (OR)=1.66 per 1 standard deviation increase, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.11-2.48], while total n-3 concentration in breast milk was associated with increased risk of non-atopic eczema (OR=1.60, 95% CI=1.03-2.50). Higher levels of total n-6 FA in colostrum were associated with increased risk of childhood rhinitis (OR=1.59, 95% CI=1.12-2.25). There was no evidence of associations between FA profile and risk of asthma., CONCLUSION: In this cohort of high-risk children, a number of modest associations were observed between FA concentrations in colostrum and breast milk and allergic disease outcomes. Further research in this area with larger sample sizes is needed.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Each region should know which its predominant allergens are. However, in addition to the differences that exist between different geographical areas, variations within the same area should be determined., OBJECTIVES: To review the predominant allergens in the paediatric population suffering from asthma or rhinitis in our region and analyse the internal variations and associated factors., METHODS: A cross-sectional, descriptive study reviewing all the patients having a diagnosis of asthma or rhinitis in the paediatric allergy units of three hospitals in a coastal region in the south-east of Spain between 2001 and 2006., RESULTS: Data on 3066 patients, 2202 (72 %) of whom were atopic, were collected. Atopy was present in 63 % of asthmatics, 90 % of those with rhinitis and 95 % of those with both asthma and rhinitis. The percentage of atopic patients increased with age. Egg was the main allergen in the first 3 years of life, followed by milk. Aeroallergen sensitization started in the second year of life and increased rapidly in subsequent years. The main aeroallergens in our region, in descending order, were: olive, mites, Salsola, Alternaria, cat, dog and grasses. With the five main aeroallergens, 98 % of atopic patients between 6 and 14 years of age, and 94 % of those between 3 and 5 years of age are detected. In children under the age of three it is necessary to combine food and aeroallergens in order to detect most of the atopic patients. Sensitization to Alternaria occurred at an early age but stabilized before that caused by other aeroallergens. Sensitization to mites was very high along the coastline (83 %) but at only 5-30 km inland it decreased by half. On the other hand, sensitization to pollen and Alternaria increased sharply as we move away from the coast., CONCLUSIONS: We have described the main allergens in children with asthma and rhinitis in a Mediterranean region in Spain, and have found marked differences depending on age and proximity to the coast. The local importance of Salsola, the early sensitization to Alternaria, and the surprisingly short reach of the influence of the coast in favouring sensitization to mites and protecting from sensitization to pollens and Alternaria are noteworthy.

N2  - The prevalence of childhood asthma is rising, particularly among boys, among 0- to 5-year-olds and 10- to 11-year-olds, and among children in households where adults smoke. Whether the increase is due to an improvement in physicians' ability to recognize and diagnose asthma, or whether the underlying causes are becoming more widespread, cannot be determined from this analysis and warrant further study.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Previous reports indicate that morbidity and mortality from asthma have increased during the past decades. Here, the mortality rate associated with asthma and possible risk factors in children and young adults in Sweden during the period 1994-2003 were evaluated., METHODS: The medical profession was asked to report suspected cases of death from asthma in individuals 1-34 years of age. All death certificates containing relevant ICD codes were reviewed. Medical records and autopsy reports were assessed and telephone interviews with next-of-kin performed., RESULTS: During the 10-year period 37 deaths due to asthma were identified. The median age at the time of death was 27 years and 6 of the deceased were younger than 15. The overall incidence of death from asthma decreased from 1.54 deaths per million in 1994 to 0.53 per million in 2003. Common risk factors were under-treatment (23/37), poor adherence to prescribed treatment (17/37) and adverse psychosocial situation (19/37). An alarming finding was that 11 of the 37 deaths were probably caused by food allergy and for 8 subjects death was associated with exposure to pet dander. The death certificates were found to contain inaccuracies with 30% of those for whom asthma was reported as the underlying cause having died from other causes., CONCLUSION: Asthma mortality in children and young adults in Sweden decreased between 1994 and 2003. Food allergy and inadequate treatment were the major risk factors for such a death. Recognition and special care of patients with asthma who have shown signs of non-compliance, denial or severe food allergy must be encouraged.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about factors associated with progression of childhood asthma from onset of symptoms to index date determined by medical records., OBJECTIVE: To determine the duration between the onset of asthma symptoms to index date of asthma (ie, time when one met the criteria for asthma) and associated factors., METHODS: Study participants came from a sample of 839 healthy children, aged 5 to 12 years, who had participated in a previous study. Comprehensive medical record reviews were conducted to determine first documentation of asthma symptoms and index date of asthma. Factors were evaluated for an association with the duration from onset of asthma symptoms to index date of asthma., RESULTS: Of the study sample, 222 children met the criteria for asthma and had an available onset date of asthma symptoms. The median ages at onset of asthma symptoms and the index date were 5.6 and 7.6 years, respectively. The median duration between onset of asthma symptoms and index date was 2.9 months, and the mean was 17.2 months. There was a tendency for patients with a pet at home (P = .047), exercise-induced symptoms (P = .04), younger age at symptom onset (P = .05), and more severe asthma (P = .05) to have a shorter duration from onset of symptoms to index date., CONCLUSIONS: The duration from onset of asthma symptoms to index date of asthma varies significantly depending on host and environmental factors. It does not necessarily correlate with commonly recognized risk factors for incidence or severity of asthma.

N2  - RATIONALE: Virus-induced wheezing episodes in infancy often precede the development of asthma. Whether infections with specific viral pathogens confer differential future asthma risk is incompletely understood., OBJECTIVES: To define the relationship between specific viral illnesses and early childhood asthma development., METHODS: A total of 259 children were followed prospectively from birth to 6 years of age. The etiology and timing of specific viral wheezing respiratory illnesses during early childhood were assessed using nasal lavage, culture, and multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The relationships of these virus-specific wheezing illnesses and other risk factors to the development of asthma were analyzed., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Viral etiologies were identified in 90% of wheezing illnesses. From birth to age 3 years, wheezing with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (odds ratio [OR], 2.6), rhinovirus (RV) (OR, 9.8), or both RV and RSV (OR , 10) was associated with increased asthma risk at age 6 years. In Year 1, both RV wheezing (OR, 2.8) and aeroallergen sensitization (OR, 3.6) independently increased asthma risk at age 6 years. By age 3 years, wheezing with RV (OR, 25.6) was more strongly associated with asthma at age 6 years than aeroallergen sensitization (OR, 3.4). Nearly 90% (26 of 30) of children who wheezed with RV in Year 3 had asthma at 6 years of age., CONCLUSIONS: Among outpatient viral wheezing illnesses in infancy and early childhood, those caused by RV infections are the most significant predictors of the subsequent development of asthma at age 6 years in a high-risk birth cohort.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the risk factors associated with childhood asthma, in children attending Isra University Hospital, Hyderabad., STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study., PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Isra University Hospital between September 2005 to August 2006., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 398 age-matched children (200 asthmatic and 198 non-asthmatic). Information was collected concerning their familial history of atopy, birth weight, environment, breastfeeding, disease and treatment history. Odds ratio was calculated for determining the risk., RESULTS: The children were aged between 12 months and 8 years and 60% were male. The asthmatic children were hospitalized more frequently than the non-asthmatic children (p < 0.0001). Most of the asthmatic children lived in the urban areas of Hyderabad [odd ratio (OR) = 16.7, 95% CI = 3.1-14.6, p < 0.0001], had a parental history of asthma (OR = 26.8, 95% CI = 10.8-68.2, p < 0.0001) or allergic rhinitis (OR = 4, 95% CI = 1.2-13.4, p= 0.01), 38.5% had at least one person who smoked, and were weaned earlier than the non-asthmatic children (OR =12.4, 95% CI = 1.3-4.4, p < 0.01)., CONCLUSION: Childhood asthma was strongly associated with a family history of asthma and allergic rhinitis, the urban place of residence, having smokers as parents and early weaning from maternal breast milk. The results highlight the need to educate the parents about the risk of smoking and early weaning in the development of asthma.

N2  - The aim of the study was to assess whether perinatal factors are associated with the risk of asthma in childhood in a register-based, nested case-control study in Finland. All children born between January 1, 1996, and April 30, 2004, who were entitled to a special reimbursement for antiasthmatic drugs (i.e., had diagnosed asthma by 2006 and had purchased inhaled corticosteroids or montelukast at least once), were identified (n = 21,038). For each case, one matched control child was selected. The associations between perinatal factors, derived from the Finnish Medical Birth Register, and the risk of asthma were analyzed by conditional logistic regression. In the final multivariate model, maternal asthma, young age, smoking, previous miscarriages, and a high number of previous deliveries, as well as cesarean section, low gestational age, and low ponderal index, were associated with an increased risk of asthma in children diagnosed before the age of 3 years. Among children diagnosed at the age of 3 years or later, maternal asthma, low gestational age, and low ponderal index were associated with an increased risk, and a high number of previous deliveries was associated with a decreased risk of asthma. In conclusion, perinatal factors play a role in the development of asthma in childhood, but the etiology may differ in early and late-onset asthma.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of childhood asthma in the USA increased by 50% from 1980 to 2000, with especially high prevalence in poor urban communities., METHODS: Data on the prevalence of asthma among children aged 4-5 years and on hospitalisations for asthma among children less than 15 years old were available for 42 health service catchment areas within New York City. Street tree counts were provided by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. The proximity to pollution sources, sociodemographic characteristics and population density for each area were also measured., RESULTS: Controlling for potential confounders, an increase in tree density of 1 standard deviation (SD, 343 trees/km(2)) was associated with a lower prevalence of asthma (RR, 0.71 per SD of tree density; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.79), but not with hospitalisations for asthma (RR, 0.89 per SD of tree density; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.06)., CONCLUSIONS: Street trees were associated with a lower prevalence of early childhood asthma. This study does not permit inference that trees are causally related to asthma at the individual level. The PlaNYC sustainability initiative, which includes a commitment to plant one million trees by the year 2017, offers an opportunity for a large prospective evaluation.

N2  - Asthma therapy recognizes three fundamental key points: primary prevention, secondary prevention, including the control of inflammatory mechanisms and related symptoms, and tertiary prevention, consisting in the treatment of the early phases leading to airway remodelling. As for primary prevention in infants at ''high risk'' exclusive breastfeeding for at least 3-6 months and the prevention of allergen exposure, respiratory infections and tobacco smoking are recommended. Recent findings suggest a possible protective role of diet (i.e. the intake of vegetables and vitamins and the pre-probiotics). About secondary prevention, the efficacy of drugs suggested by international guidelines (GINA or ARIA) such as antihistamines, leukotriene modifiers and inhaled corticosteroids, it is well known; such drugs can be variably used in different associations, in accordance with the clinical features of the single patient. Among the new therapeutic perspectives, a special attention should be paid to anti-IgE monoclonal antibodies and other humanized monoclonal antibodies targeting and neutralizing inflammatory cytokines; chimeric allergens blocking mast cell receptors; recombinant interleukins with ''anti-inflammatory'' or ''anti-allergic'' properties; in vitro expansion of T lymphocytes with regulatory functions (Treg), and their possible therapeutic approach. Moreover, new experimental observations have identified the role of molecules derived from engineering technologies able to control allergic inflammation. As for prevention and treatment of allergic symptoms, specific immunotherapy has a relevant role, moreover in the paediatric area: it finds progressively greater consensus in terms of both efficacy and safety and is finally recognized in the latest GINA and ARIA guidelines. Tertiary prevention, which concerns the so called ''airway remodeling'', includes new therapeutic approaches such as montelukast, which can control fibroblasts proliferation and their transformation in myofibroblasts, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Finally, the use of peptide and non-peptide antagonists of Bradykinin B2 receptors seems to be of great interest.

N2  - We present prevalence estimates of indoor and outdoor environmental risk factors for asthma from a cross-sectional study of children 1 to 17 years of age living in Buffalo, New York. A child's primary caretaker completed a questionnaire about the household's demographics, lifestyle habits, housing, indoor and outdoor environment, and the child's activity patterns, family history of asthma, asthma symptoms and treatment, and medical care access. Significant environmental risk factors were presence of smokers in the household, humidifier or vaporizer use, chemical odors indoors, frequent truck traffic, and chemical odors outdoors. Most of these risk factors can be mitigated or controlled.

N2  - Success in treating and managing bronchial asthma in children and adolescents is known to rely on active cooperation on behalf of both the patients and their parents. Compliance in terms of pharmaceutical or behavioural intervention is often insufficient to prevent further aggravation and exacerbation. Specific measures for enhancing therapy compliance have been well received in the German Health Care System, and research results indicate their effectiveness in reducing health care utilization and in improving quality of life. Studies that would ascribe such effects to regular medication intake or reduced exposure to allergic elicitors, however, are still lacking.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have investigated the prevalence and risk factors of asthma in Canadian Aboriginal children., OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of asthma and asthma-like symptoms, as well as the risk factors for asthma-like symptoms, in Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children living in the northern territories of Canada., METHODS: Data on 2404 children, aged between 0 and 11 years, who participated in the North component of the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth were used in the present study. A child was considered to have an asthma-like symptom if there was a report of ever having had asthma, asthma attacks or wheeze in the past 12 months., RESULTS: After excluding 59 children with missing information about race, 1399 children (59.7%) were of Aboriginal ancestry. The prevalence of asthma was significantly lower (P<0.05) in Aboriginal children (5.7%) than non-Aboriginal children (10.0%), while the prevalence of wheeze was similar between Aboriginal (15.0%) and non-Aboriginal (14.5%) children. In Aboriginal children, infants and toddlers had a significantly greater prevalence of asthma-like symptoms (30.0%) than preschool-aged children (21.5%) and school-aged children (11.5%). Childhood allergy and a mother's daily smoking habit were significant risk factors for asthma-like symptoms in both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children. In addition, infants and toddlers were at increased risk of asthma-like symptoms in Aboriginal children. In analyses restricted to specific outcomes, a mother's daily smoking habit was a significant risk factor for current wheeze in Aboriginal children and for ever having had asthma in non-Aboriginal children., CONCLUSIONS: Asthma prevalence appears to be lower in Aboriginal children than in non-Aboriginal children. The association between daily maternal smoking and asthma-like symptoms, which has been mainly reported for children living in urban areas, was observed in Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children living in northern and remote communities in Canada.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This study examined prenatal, perinatal and early childhood predictors of wheezing phenotypes in the first decade of life., METHODS: Information on current wheezing, was collected prospectively from five surveys conducted every 2 years over the first decade of life. Five wheezing phenotypes were defined: non-wheezers, preschool, primary-school, intermittent and persistent wheezers. Logistic regression with adjustment for survey design was used to determine the predictors of wheezing phenotypes., RESULTS: Data on 2711 children were used in the analysis. Early respiratory infection, the child's allergy and parental asthma were significant risk factors for preschool, intermittent and persistent wheeze. The child's allergy and parental asthma had stronger associations with persistent wheeze than with preschool wheeze. Breastfeeding was a significant predictor of both preschool and intermittent wheezing. Daycare attendance was a risk factor for preschool wheeze but a protective factor for primary-school wheezing. Crowding at home was a protective factor for both preschool and primary-school wheeze. Parental smoking was a significant factor for preschool wheeze., CONCLUSION: This study identified different predictors for each wheezing phenotype with some degree of overlap. The observed differential effects for these conditions raises the possibility that there are different aetiologies for asthma among children.

N2  - AIM: To determine whether children with asthma and on inhaled corticosteroids have more behavioural problems, such as aggressiveness and hyperactivity, as compared with healthy controls and with children under medical care because of other disorders., METHODS: Questionnaires were given to three groups of children: a group of asthmatic children with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), a group of children attending the ear, nose and throat (ENT) outpatient clinic and the healthy controls. Included were questions about health, medication use, demographical data and about behaviour, including the child behaviour check list (CBCL) and questions about attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)., RESULTS: Forty asthmatic children on ICS, 50 children visiting the ENT outpatient clinic and 183 healthy controls were studied. The total CBCL and mean ADHD scores of the children on ICS were 28.1 and 9.1, which were both significantly higher than the scores of the healthy controls (20.4 and 7.1), but not when compared with the ENT outpatient group (26.2 and 8.6). Further analysis revealed statistically significant differences between the ICS group and healthy controls in CBCL-axes. There were, however, no differences between the ENT group and the ICS on one side and the healthy controls on the other., CONCLUSION: There is a difference in behaviour between healthy children and asthmatic children on ICS, but not when compared with children visiting the ENT department. Although hyperactivity, aggressiveness and anxiety might occur in children on ICS, this is probably caused by individual susceptibility. Being under specialist care can possibly explain behavioural differences between children on ICS and healthy controls.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Children born by Caesarean section have modified intestinal bacterial colonization and consequently may have an increased risk of developing asthma under the hygiene hypothesis. The results of previous studies that have investigated the association between Caesarean section and asthma have been conflicting., OBJECTIVE: To review published literature and perform a meta-analysis summarizing the evidence in support of an association between children born by Caesarean section and asthma., METHODS: MEDLINE, Web Science, Google Scholar and PubMed were searched to identify relevant studies. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each study from the reported prevalence of asthma in children born by Caesarean section and in control children. Meta-analysis was then used to derive a combined OR and test for heterogeneity in the findings between studies., RESULTS: Twenty-three studies were identified. The overall meta-analysis revealed an increase in the risk of asthma in children delivered by Caesarean section (OR=1.22, 95% CI 1.14, 1.29). However, in this analysis, there was evidence of heterogeneity (I(2)=46%) that was statistically significant (P<0.001). Restricting the analysis to childhood studies, this heterogeneity was markedly decreased (I(2)=32%) and no longer attained statistical significance (P=0.08). In these studies, there was also evidence of an increase (P<0.001) in the risk of asthma after Caesarean section (OR=1.20, 95% CI 1.14, 12.6)., CONCLUSION: In this meta-analysis, we found a 20% increase in the subsequent risk of asthma in children who had been delivered by Caesarean section.

N2  - Environmental exposures during the early years and airway obstruction that develops during this time, in conjunction with genetic susceptibility, are important factors in the development of persistent asthma in childhood. Established risk factors for childhood asthma include frequent wheezing during the first 3 years, a parental history of asthma, a history of eczema, allergic rhinitis, wheezing apart from colds, and peripheral blood eosinophilia, as well as allergic sensitization to aeroallergens and certain foods. Risk factors for the development of asthma in adulthood remain ill defined. Moreover, reasons for variability in the clinical course of asthma--persistence in some individuals and progression in others--remain an enigma. The distinction between disease persistence and disease progression suggests that these are different entities or phenotypes. There is currently no consensus on whether disease progression requires either airway inflammation or airway remodeling or the combination of the two. For patients with irreversible airway obstruction, inflammation might, in part, be necessary but perhaps not entirely sufficient to induce the irreversible component, some of which could be attributed to alterations in the structure of the bronchial wall. Intervening with intermittent or daily inhaled corticosteroids in high-risk infants and children does not prevent disease progression or impaired lung growth. These findings, however, might not apply to adults, and further study in adults is needed to determine the effect of inhaled corticosteroid therapy on disease progression.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Many chronic diseases are the product of an underlying pathologic condition and superimposed acute exacerbations. This model may apply to several conditions such as asthma, other obstructive lung diseases, or atherosclerosis. For exposures affecting both the development of chronic disease and its exacerbation, the usual methods to derive attributable risks (AR) are inappropriate., METHODS: We expand traditional risk assessment methods to estimate the AR for exacerbations under a "chronic disease model." We use asthma in children as the chronic disease and air pollution as the exposure of interest. We estimate bronchitis symptom exacerbations attributable to air pollution, using data from the Children's Health Study to estimate asthma prevalence and symptom occurrence, and we examine the distribution of exposure and its acute and chronic effects., RESULTS: In the combined AR model, 39.8% of exacerbations were attributable to air pollution, compared with 33.5% in the traditional model, which ignores a chronic effect of pollution on asthma development. Thus, there is a 1.19-fold higher estimated burden with the combined model. The difference is due to exacerbations caused by other factors (ie, not by air pollution) but nonetheless occurring among those assumed to have asthma that developed due to traffic-related pollution. The proposed model is applicable to other risk factors that play a role both in both the development of a chronic disease and its exacerbation., CONCLUSIONS: Traditional approaches to the calculation of attributable risk may underestimate the health impact of long-term environmental or other exposures that produce both chronic and acute disease.

N2  - Environmental exposures during early life have been suggested to have the greatest impact on childhood asthma. Our aim was to evaluate the risk factors associated with asthma at age 7 yr in a high-risk cohort that participated in a randomized controlled study on the primary prevention of asthma. Indoor exposures were characterized before birth and at 2 weeks, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 months after birth and again at 7 yr. Nasal scrapings for respiratory viruses were done at the same intervals during the first 2 yr. At age 7, the children were assessed by a pediatric allergist and had allergy skin tests. Logistic regression analysis was undertaken to evaluate the effect of exposures on asthma for the entire cohort with adjustment for group allocation. In addition to the lower risk of asthma in the intervention group, we found a higher prevalence of asthma at age 7 for males, those having a positive history of asthma in mother, father, or older siblings, for children residing in Winnipeg and for atopic subjects. Upon adjustment for intervention group assignment and baseline factors, significant environmental risk factors during year 1 included dog ownership and respiratory syncytial viral infection detected at 12 months while maternal smoking was protective. Dog ownership was a significant risk factor in year 2, but highly correlated with dog ownership in year 1. Indoor environmental exposures during year 7 were not associated with asthma at age 7. Maternal smoking at year 7 was associated with a reduced risk of asthma at 7 yr. Early-life exposures were more important determinants than those in later years. A 'window of opportunity' exists for intervention measures to be applied.

N2  - Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis in early life is a risk factor for later development of asthma and atopy. Ribavirin is the only effective drug currently available against acute RSV bronchiolitis. However, the long-term effects of ribavirin remain unclear. We investigated a cohort of children hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis from when they were under 2 yr old until they reached a mean age of 6.2 yr. In total, we enrolled 175 children in this study. Both the group treated with ribavirin and the group not treated with ribavirin included high-risk young children with congenital heart disease or chronic lung disease. Their respective age-matched controls, that we labeled groups A and B, both without ribavirin treatment, consisted of previously healthy subjects. Wheezing was either verified by physicians or estimated by a questionnaire. Allergen sensitization was judged by serum allergen-specific IgE levels. The cumulative incidence of physician-diagnosed asthma or recurrent wheezing in the ribavirin group (15%) was significantly lower than its incidence in the non-ribavirin-treated group (34%, p = 0.049), and in the control A group (43%, p = 0.005). Allergen sensitization was also least frequent in the ribavirin group. Ribavirin therapy was an independent factor in reducing the risk of developing asthma, asthma/recurrent wheezing, and sensitization to D. pteronyssinus/D. farinae. The long-term value of ribavirin for acute RSV bronchiolitis and its underlying mechanisms deserves further research.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Early childhood immunizations have been viewed as promoters of asthma development by stimulating a T(H)2-type immune response or decreasing microbial pressure, which shifts the balance between T(H)1 and T(H)2 immunity., OBJECTIVE: Differing time schedules for childhood immunizations may explain the discrepant findings of an association with asthma reported in observational studies. This research was undertaken to determine whether timing of diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus (DPT) immunization has an effect on the development of childhood asthma by age 7 years., METHODS: This was a retrospective longitudinal study of a cohort of children born in Manitoba in 1995. The complete immunization and health care records of cohort children from birth until age 7 years were available for analysis. The adjusted odds ratio for asthma at age 7 years according to timing of DPT immunization was computed from multivariable logistic regression., RESULTS: Among 11, 531 children who received at least 4 doses of DPT, the risk of asthma was reduced to (1/2) in children whose first dose of DPT was delayed by more than 2 months. The likelihood of asthma in children with delays in all 3 doses was 0.39 (95% CI, 0.18-0.86)., CONCLUSION: We found a negative association between delay in administration of the first dose of whole-cell DPT immunization in childhood and the development of asthma; the association was greater with delays in all of the first 3 doses. The mechanism for this phenomenon requires further research.

N2  - Asthma is one of the most common chronic illnesses affecting children. However, distinguishing true asthma from recurrent respiratory symptoms is often a challenge for primary care providers. Many risk factors can help predict persistent disease, including presence of allergies or eczema, family history, symptoms apart from obvious infection, and the severity of previous episodes. Because neither cure nor prevention is currently a viable option, the treatment is aimed at minimizing symptoms and maximizing asthma control.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoke and genetic susceptibility are risk factors for asthma and wheezing. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is a combined effect of interleukin-13 gene (IL13) polymorphisms and tobacco smoke on persistent childhood wheezing and asthma., METHODS: In the Isle of Wight birth cohort (UK, 1989-1999), five IL13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): rs1800925 (-1112C/T), rs2066960, rs1295686, rs20541 (R130Q) and rs1295685 were genotyped. Parents were asked whether their children had wheezed in the last 12 months at ages 1, 2, 4 and 10 years. Children who reported wheeze in the first 4 years of life and also had wheezing at age 10 were classified as early-onset persistent wheeze phenotype; non-wheezers never wheezed up to age 10. Persistent asthma was defined as having a diagnosis of asthma both during the first four years of life and at age 10. Logistic regression methods were used to analyze data on 791 children with complete information. Potential confounders were gender, birth weight, duration of breast feeding, and household cat or dog present during pregnancy., RESULTS: Maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with early-onset persistent wheeze (OR 2.93, p < 0.0001); polymorphisms in IL13 were not (OR 1.15, p = 0.60 for the common haplotype pair). However, the effect of maternal smoking during pregnancy was stronger in children with the common IL13 haplotype pair compared to those without it (OR 5.58 and OR 1.29, respectively; p for interaction = 0.014). Single SNP analysis revealed a similar statistical significance for rs20541 (p for interaction = 0.02). Comparable results were observed for persistent childhood asthma (p for interaction = 0.03)., CONCLUSION: This is the first report that shows a combined effect of in utero exposure to smoking and IL13 on asthma phenotypes in childhood. The results emphasize that genetic studies need to take environmental exposures into account, since they may explain contradictory findings.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Current prophylactic feeding guidelines recommend a delayed introduction of solids for the prevention of atopic diseases. This study investigates whether a delayed introduction of solids (past 4 or 6 months) is protective against the development of eczema, asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food or inhalant sensitization at the age of 6 years., METHODS: Data from 2073 children in the ongoing LISA birth cohort study were analyzed at 6 years of age. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed for all children and for children without skin or allergic symptoms within the first 6 months of life to take into account reverse causality., RESULTS: A delayed introduction of solids (past 4 or 6 months) was not associated with decreased odds for asthma, allergic rhinitis, or sensitization against food or inhalant allergens at 6 years of age. On the contrary, food sensitization was more frequent in children who were introduced to solids later. The relationship between the timing of solid food introduction and eczema was not clear. There was no protective effect of a late introduction of solids or a less diverse diet within the first 4 months of life. However, in children without early skin or allergic symptoms were considered, eczema was significantly more frequent in children who received a more diverse diet within the first 4 months., CONCLUSIONS: This study found no evidence supporting a delayed introduction of solids beyond 4 or 6 months for the prevention of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food or inhalant sensitization at the age of 6 years. For eczema, the results were conflicting, and a protective effect of a delayed introduction of solids cannot be excluded. Positive associations between late introduction of solids and food sensitization have to be interpreted with caution. A true protective effect of a delayed introduction of solids on food sensitization seems unlikely.

T1  - Wheezy babies--wheezy adults? Review on long-term outcome until adulthood after early childhood wheezing.
A1  - Piippo-Savolainen, Eija
A1  - Korppi, Matti
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - UNLABELLED: Population-based birth cohort studies have documented that about 30% of children suffer from wheezing during respiratory infection before their third birthday. Recurrent wheezing is common in early childhood, but most patients outgrow their symptoms by school age. However, recent long-term postbronchiolitis follow-up studies from Sweden and Finland have revealed that asthma is present in about 40% of young adults and over half of the cases are relapses after many symptom-free years. In population studies, the principal predictors for later asthma have been parental asthma, recurrent wheezing, atopy and eosinophilia. In the Swedish postbronchiolitis study, atopic diathesis through the development of clinical atopy, and early passive smoking through bronchial hyper-reactivity or later active smoking led to adult asthma. The Finnish postbronchiolitis follow-up stressed early recurrence of wheezing, wheezing induced by less invasive viruses than respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), early-life atopy and eosinophilia and parental asthma as predictors for adult asthma., CONCLUSION: The majority of wheezing infants and children outgrow their symptoms by school age, but based on recent long-term follow-up studies, asthma relapses are common in young adults. These studies have highlighted parental asthma, maternal smoking and wheezing induced by other viruses than RSV as predictive factors for later asthma.

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Food allergy associated clinical and social burdens have increased substantially in prevalence in the past decade. Coexisting asthma is a significant problem as food reactions tend to be more severe when they involve the lung. Food allergy also increases asthma morbidity in adults and children., RECENT FINDINGS: Especially in early infancy, food allergy can be related to the development of future asthma. For diagnosis, cut-off values are very important for both specific IgE levels and skin-prick test when interpreting food allergy. For the treatment, oral immunotherapy is showing promise for refractory patients with IgE-mediated food allergies., SUMMARY: Food allergies can be classified as IgE-mediated or non-IgE-mediated. Besides foods, some additives and preservatives can also trigger asthma in certain people. Asthma may develop in about 5% of individuals who suffer from food allergy and current asthma may be triggered by foods among 6-8% of children and 2% of adults. Because of the difficulty of confirming diagnosis of food allergy, novel approaches are currently being investigated and new therapy modalities are being sought. For total asthma control and for better quality of life, steps should be taken to avoid foods in cases of food allergy.

A1  - Salam, Muhammad T
A1  - Islam, Talat
A1  - Gilliland, Frank D
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A growing body of evidence indicates that residential proximity to traffic sources increases the risk for asthma and asthma exacerbations. In this review we have considered publications from 2006-2007 that examined the impact of residential traffic-related exposures on asthma occurrence and severity., RECENT FINDINGS: In these studies, exposures were estimated using traffic metrics based on residential distances from major roads and freeways, traffic densities around homes, and models of traffic exposure. Overall, residential proximity to traffic sources was associated with increased asthma occurrence and exacerbations in both children and adults. Land-use regression models were superior to individual traffic metrics in explaining the variability of traffic-related pollutants. Susceptibility may also play a role in variation in the effects of traffic on asthma., SUMMARY: There is consistent evidence that living near traffic sources is associated with asthma occurrence and exacerbations. Future studies have the opportunity to improve exposure estimates by measuring traffic-related pollutants near homes and schools and including time/activity patterns in prediction models. Further research is also warranted to investigate the differential impact of traffic by genetic and other susceptibility factors and to identify specific pollutants that underlie the adverse effect of traffic on asthma.

N2  - Risk factors for central nervous system (CNS) tumours in children remain largely unknown. Evidence of an inverse relationship between atopy and tumour development exists in adults but little is known about childhood tumours. This study aims to examine the risk of childhood CNS tumours given a history of eczema and asthma. Cases of children diagnosed with CNS tumours (n=575) and controls (n=6292) from the UK Childhood Cancer Study (UKCCS) were analysed using conditional logistic regression comparing reported histories of allergic disease. Asthma was statistically significantly and negatively associated with all CNS tumours (odds ratios, OR 0.75, confidence of interval, CI(95%): 0.58-0.97), though this was not observed for eczema (OR 0.94, CI(95%): 0.74-1.18). Individuals who had suffered both asthma and eczema showed the most significant reduction in risk (OR 0.48, CI(95%): 0.28-0.81). Analysis by tumour subtype showed the strongest effect for the medulloblastoma/PNET group. These results may have a biological explanation with raised immunosurveillance in atopic individuals protecting against the development of brain tumours. Alternative explanations might include bias, reverse causality or confounding.

N2  - RATIONALE: Evidence is emerging that exposure to maternal distress in early life plays a causal role in the development of childhood asthma., OBJECTIVES: Because much of the data are from high-risk cohorts, we undertook a birth cohort study in a complete population of children to test this association., METHODS: Using Manitoba, Canada's, health care and prescription databases, this longitudinal study assessed the association between maternal distress during the first year of life and onward, and asthma at age 7 in a 1995 birth cohort of 13,907 children., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Maternal distress was defined on the basis of health care or prescription medication use for depression or anxiety. Asthma status was derived from health care and prescription records for asthma, using a definition validated by comparison to pediatric allergist diagnosis. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the likelihood of asthma (odds ratio [OR], 95% confidence interval [95% CI]). Independent of well-known asthma risk factors, our population-based study of a non-high-risk cohort demonstrated an increased risk of childhood asthma (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01-1.55) among children exposed to continued maternal distress from birth until age 7. Exposure to maternal depression and anxiety limited to the first year of life did not have a demonstrable association with subsequent asthma. Of interest, we observed that the risk of asthma associated with continued maternal distress was increased in children living in high- versus low-income households (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.12-1.85)., CONCLUSIONS: Maternal distress in early life plays a role in the development of childhood asthma, especially if it continues beyond the postpartum period.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in the world, leading to an increased rate of hospitalization. We performed this study to better understand the factors leading to admission among asthmatic children., METHODS: We performed a study among asthmatic children in a referral hospital for asthma and allergy in Tehran. Sixty-three cases were selected from asthmatic children admitted to the emergency room (ER) who still had an indication for ward or intensive care unit admission after primary treatment. Our control group was the asthmatic children discharged after primary treatment and patients who were referred to the asthma and allergy clinic (63 patients). Data were obtained by structured questionnaires filled out during clinical interviews., RESULTS: There was a significant difference in mean age (5 years for cases vs. 6 years for controls; p = 0.049), personal and familial allergic history (69.8 and 57.1% for cases vs. 34.9 and 36.5% for controls; p < 0.01 and p = 0.02, respectively), history of recent respiratory infections (79.4% for cases vs. 49.2% for controls; p < 0.01), hospitalization history due to asthma (57.1% for cases vs. 23.8% for controls; p < 0.01) and regular use of inhaled corticosteroid (66.7% for cases vs. 33.3% for controls; p < 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm most previous observations, suggesting that recent respiratory infections, hospitalization, personal or familial allergy, disease severity and lower ages are important factors leading to hospitalization. We also found that regular clinical follow-up, regular use of inhaled corticosteroids, higher IgE levels and O2 saturation may lower the probability of hospitalization during asthmatic attacks.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Predicting school-age asthma from obstructive airways disease (OAD) in early life is difficult, even when parental and children's atopic manifestations are taken into consideration., OBJECTIVE: To assess if the severity of OAD in the first 2 years of life predicts asthma at 10 years of age., METHODS: From a nested case control study within the Environment and Childhood Asthma study, 233 2-year-old subjects with recurrent (> or = 2 episodes) bronchial obstruction (rBO+) and 216 subjects without bronchial obstruction (rBO-) underwent clinical examination, parental interview, treadmill test and metacholine bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) measurement at 10 years. A severity score at 2 years was calculated by frequency, persistence of bronchial obstruction and hospital admissions because of OAD., MAIN OUTCOMES: Current asthma at 10 years (asthma with symptoms and/or asthma medication during the past year and/or positive treadmill test). Secondary outcome was metacholine BHR at 10 years., RESULTS: Compared with rBO- subjects, adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) of current asthma among rBO+ was 7.9 (4.1, 15.3), and among rBO+ with a severity score of > 5, 20.2 (9.9, 41.3). In receiver operated characteristic analysis, positive and negative predictive values demonstrated the applicability and value of the score, with an optimal cut-off at severity score 5. Children with severity score > 5 had severe BHR more often (PD20 metacholine < 1 micromol) than children with a lower or 0 score (p = 0.0041)., CONCLUSION: Using a simple scoring system, a high severity score of OAD by 2 years of age is a strong risk factor for, and may predict, current asthma at 10 years of age.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - There have been a number of guidelines for asthma treatment published throughout the world. However, childhood asthma guidelines must be developed in consideration of the background of the individual countries. The second version of the Japanese Pediatric Guideline for the Treatment and Management of Bronchial Asthma 2002 (JPGL 2002) was published by the Japanese Society of Pediatric Allergy and Clinical Immunology (JSPACI) in November 2002, and was popular among Japanese physicians. After the publication of the JPGL, the incidence of pediatric asthma deaths decreased in Japan. In JPGL 2005 the recommendations were re-edited based on Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) and the JPGL 2002. In comparison to the GINA guidelines, the JPGL 2005 include a classification system of asthma severity, recommendations for long-term management organized by age, a special mention of infantile asthma, and an emphasis on prevention and early intervention.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - QUESTIONS: Passive smoking is a problem in children and adults, but recent studies found the impact to be strongest in the developing foetus and the first years of life. In this cross sectional study we investigated the effect of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) on atopic and wheezing disorders in Austrian preschool children., METHODS: 1737 Austrian preschool children participated in a cross sectional questionnaire survey about passive smoking and the impact on wheezy bronchitis, asthma, hay fever and atopic dermatitis., RESULTS: Up to 46% of the participating children were exposed to ETS at some stage in their life. Children of lower socioeconomic status were at exceptionally risk.ETS exposure during pregnancy resulted in a significantly increased risk for wheezing in the first year of life (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.0-2.6), wheezing in the past 12 months (OR 1.5; 95% CI1.0-2.4) and doctor diagnosed asthma (OR 2.1;95% CI 1.0-4.1). Furthermore, breastfeeding and consumption of fruits and vegetables were less common in smoking families., CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms previous studies, that in particular prenatal ETS exposure is a risk factor for wheezing and asthma in preschool children. Despite this, children exposed to ETS also live a "less healthier life" in terms of breast feeding and antioxidant intake. In the light of recent studies reporting increased oxidative stress in children exposed to passive smoking, the low intake of fruits and vegetables is a further concern.

N2  - Oropharyngeal aspiration (OPA) of food and fluids is known to be associated with pneumonia in dysphagic children with neurological disease and direct causality is often assumed. However, little is known about the relationship between OPA and pneumonia in medically complex children when other possible risk factors for pneumonia are considered. We examined the association of World Health Organization (WHO)-defined pneumonia in a heterogeneous group of children with swallowing dysfunction identified by a videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS). A retrospective chart review of 150 children (aged 2 weeks to 20 years) was undertaken to determine the relationship between pneumonia and (i) type of swallowing dysfunction (including OPA), (ii) consistency of aspirated food/fluid, and (iii) other factors including multisystem involvement and age (1 year). In univariate analysis, the odds ratio (OR) for pneumonia was significantly increased in children with post-swallow residue (PSR) (OR 2.5) or aspiration on thin fluids (OR 2.4), but not with aspiration of thick fluids or purees. In multi-logistic regression, type of swallowing dysfunction or aspirated food/fluid were no longer significant. Instead, pneumonia was significantly associated with diagnosis of asthma (OR 13.25), Down syndrome (OR 22.10), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (OR 4.28), or history of LRTI (OR 8.28), moist cough (OR 9.17) or oxygen supplementation (OR 6.19). Children with multisystem involvement demonstrated a higher association with pneumonia, but no difference was found for age. We conclude that the impact of OPA on development of pneumonia is considerably reduced once other factors in children with multisystem involvement are taken into account.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Assessment of allergic sensitization is not routinely performed in infants and young children with eczema., OBJECTIVE: To determine whether infants who have atopic eczema (with sensitization) are at a greater risk of developing asthma and allergic rhinitis (AR) than those with non-atopic eczema (without concurrent sensitization)., METHODS: The presence of eczema was prospectively documented until 2 years of age in a birth cohort of 620 infants with a family history of atopic disease. Sensitization status was determined by skin prick tests (SPTs) at 6, 12, and 24 months using six common allergens. Interviews were conducted at 6 and 7 years to determine the presence of asthma and AR., RESULTS: Within the first 2 years of life, 28.7% of the 443 children who could be classified had atopic eczema: 20.5% had non-atopic eczema, 19.0% were asymptomatic but sensitized and 31.8% were asymptomatic and not sensitized. When compared with children with non-atopic eczema in the first 2 years of life, children with atopic eczema had a substantially greater risk of asthma [odds ratio (OR)=3.52, 95% confidence interval=1.88-6.59] and AR (OR=2.91, 1.48-5.71). The increased risk of asthma was even greater if the infant had a large SPT (OR=4.61, 2.34-9.09) indicative of food allergy. There was no strong evidence that children with non-atopic eczema had an increased risk of asthma or AR compared with asymptomatic children., CONCLUSION: In children with eczema within the first 2 years of life, SPT can provide valuable information on the risk of childhood asthma and AR.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to report factors associated with asthma hospital admission, such as patient characteristics, type of admission and subsequent outcome i.e. discharge or death, for the years 2000-2005. These data are used for health economic models regarding asthma burden in the hospital setting in Australia., METHODS: Data was obtained from the Australian Centre for Asthma Monitoring using their amalgamated dataset from all states and territories. Admissions under ICD-10 codes J45 'Asthma' plus all subcodes, and J46 'acute severe asthma' were included. Codes for associated comorbidity at the time of admission were identified, as well as the month of death, age, gender and length and the type of stay. Confidence intervals for death rate assumed a binomial distribution because of the rarity of event., RESULTS: The total number of all-cause deaths for the 5-year observation period was 289 from 202,739 asthma separations or 0.14% or 143 deaths/100,000 separations and the highest rate was seen in patients over 45 years. Acute upper respiratory tract infections were reported in up to 25% of all asthma hospital admissions. Length of stay was up to a mean average of 10.2 days in patients who died (SD 15.3). In 5 years observation there was 152,758 emergency asthma admissions which contributed greatly to Australian healthcare burden., CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that emergency admissions dominate asthma care in the hospital setting in Australia, which suggests poor asthma control in some patients with subsequent economic burden. Asthma-related mortality remains a risk for specific patients in the hospital setting.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether exclusive and prolonged breast feeding reduces the risk of childhood asthma and allergy by age 6.5 years., DESIGN: Cluster randomised trial., SETTING: 31 Belarussian maternity hospitals and their affiliated polyclinics., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 17,046 mother-infant pairs were enrolled, of whom 13,889 (81.5%) were followed up at age 6.5 years., INTERVENTION: Breastfeeding promotion intervention modelled on the WHO/UNICEF baby friendly hospital initiative., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: International study of asthma and allergies in childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire and skin prick tests of five inhalant antigens., RESULTS: The experimental intervention led to a large increase in exclusive breast feeding at 3 months (44.3% v 6.4%; P<0.001) and a significantly higher prevalence of any breast feeding at all ages up to and including 12 months. The experimental group had no reduction in risks of allergic symptoms and diagnoses or positive skin prick tests. In fact, after exclusion of six sites (three experimental and three control) with suspiciously high rates of positive skin prick tests, risks were significantly increased in the experimental group for four of the five antigens., CONCLUSIONS: These results do not support a protective effect of prolonged and exclusive breast feeding on asthma or allergy., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN37687716 [controlled-trials.com].

N2  - BACKGROUND: Asthma is a common disabling condition, with known environmental and familial risk factors and with their assumed interactions. We wanted to carry out a family study on asthma to address gene-environment interactions at a population level., METHODS: We conducted a nation-wide study on familial risks for asthma. An asthma database was constructed by linking the Multigeneration Register on 0-72-year-old subjects to the Hospital Discharge Register for diagnosed asthma cases in Sweden from years 1987 to 2004. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for affected singleton siblings, twins and spouses by comparing with those whose siblings or spouses had no asthma., RESULTS: A total of 67 370 hospitalized cases and 5638 affected siblings were identified with a familial SIR of 3.70, which was independent of sex, diagnostic age and age differences between the siblings. The SIR for different-sex twins was 5.17 and for same-sex twins it was 13.38. There was a low correlation between spouses for asthma., CONCLUSIONS: Asthma shows a higher familial risk than many common diseases. The higher difference in familial excess risk between singleton siblings and different-sex twins provides strong genetic epidemiological evidence for gene-environment interactions in asthma. The concept of gene-environment interactions needs to be accommodated in future aetiological studies on asthma. Data on environmental factors and family history are important for clinical risk estimation.

N2  - BACKGROUND: It is commonly believed that the majority of infants and young children with early atopic eczema will develop asthma in later childhood. This belief is mainly based on cross-sectional population studies. Recent evidence suggests a more complex relationship between early eczema and asthma., OBJECTIVE: This systematic review was conducted to assess the risk of developing asthma in children with atopic eczema during the first 4 years of life., METHODS: A sensitive search was performed to identify all prospective cohort studies on the topic. By pooling the eligible reports, we calculated the risk of developing asthma at 6 years of age or older in children with atopic eczema in the first 4 years of life., RESULTS: Thirteen prospective cohort studies were included, with 4 representing birth cohort studies and 9 representing eczema cohort studies. The pooled odds ratio for the risk of asthma after eczema, compared with children without eczema, in birth cohort studies was 2.14 (95% CI, 1.67-2.75). The prevalence of asthma at the age of 6 years in eczema cohort studies was 35.8% (95% CI, 32.2% to 39.9%) for inpatients and 29.5% (95% CI, 28.2% to 32.7%) for a combined group of inpatients and outpatients., CONCLUSION: Although there is an increased risk of developing asthma after eczema in early childhood, only 1 in every 3 children with eczema develops asthma during later childhood. This is lower than previously assumed., CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Our results may have important consequences for counseling patients with atopic eczema and their parents.

N2  - RATIONALE: Although it is widely assumed that the incidence of childhood respiratory allergies to common aeroallergens is directly related to allergen exposure in early life, few longitudinal studies have investigated this issue, and available data are scarce and mainly limited to high-risk groups., OBJECTIVES: To assess, in a prospective manner and in a general population, the role of early life exposures to Der p1 and Fel d1 on the inception of sensitization and asthma., METHODS: Pregnant women and their children were recruited for the Asthma Multicentre Infant Cohort Study. Overall, 1,611 newborns were initially enrolled in three cohorts in the United Kingdom and Spain. Der p1 and Fel d1 allergens were measured in household dust samples at 3 months of age for 1,474 (91.5%) participants, and skin prick tests were performed at 6 years of age on 1,182 (80.2%) participants. Wheeze and diagnosed asthma were reported in yearly questionnaires., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Exposure to Der p1 early in life was not related to a positive specific prick test or to asthma or persistent wheeze at 6 years of age. Fel d1 showed an association with all these outcomes (third vs. first tertile; odds ratio, 4.43 for positive specific prick test and 2.6 for diagnosed asthma)., CONCLUSIONS: Dose-response relationships between allergen exposure and sensitization or asthma may be allergen specific and nonlinear; a minimum threshold level is needed to induce sensitization, but no dose-response relationship exists above this level. The effect of a particular allergen seems to be similar on atopy and asthma inception.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Irritant gases and aerosols contaminating the air of indoor swimming pools can affect the lung epithelium and increase asthma risk in children. We evaluated the impact of infant swimming practice on allergic status and respiratory health later in childhood., METHODS: Clara cell protein, surfactant-associated protein D, and total and aeroallergen-specific immunoglobulin E were measured in the serum of 341 schoolchildren aged 10 to 13 years, among whom 43 had followed an infant swimming program. Asthma was defined as doctor-diagnosed asthma and/or positive exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (15% decrease in postexercise forced expiratory volume)., RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the infant swimming group and the other children regarding the levels of exhaled nitric oxide and total or aeroallergen-specific serum immunoglobulin E. Children who swam as infants showed, by contrast, a significant decrease of serum Clara cell protein and of the serum Clara cell protein/surfactant-associated protein D ratio integrating Clara cell damage and permeability changes of the lung epithelial barrier. These effects were associated with higher risks of asthma and of recurrent bronchitis. Passive exposure to tobacco alone had no effect on these outcomes but seemed to interact with infant swimming practice to increase the risk of asthma or of recurrent bronchitis., CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that infant swimming practice in chlorinated indoor swimming pools is associated with airways changes that, along with other factors, seem to predispose children to the development of asthma and recurrent bronchitis.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There has been no longitudinal study of the relation between concurrent exposure to dust mite allergen and endotoxin in early life and asthma and atopy at school age., OBJECTIVES: To examine the relation between exposure to dust mite allergen and endotoxin at age 2 to 3 months and asthma, wheeze, and atopy in high-risk children., METHODS: Birth cohort study of 440 children with parental history of atopy in the Boston metropolitan area., RESULTS: In multivariate analyses, early exposure to high levels of dust mite allergen (> or =10 microg/g) was associated with increased risks of asthma at age 7 years (odds ratio [OR], 3.0; 95% CI, 1.1-7.9) and late-onset wheeze (OR, 5.0; 95% CI, 1.5-16.4). Exposure to endotoxin levels above the lowest quartile at age 2 to 3 months was associated with reduced odds of atopy at school age (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.2-0.9). In contrast with its inverse association with atopy, endotoxin exposure in early life was associated with an increased risk of any wheeze between ages 1 and 7 years that did not change significantly with time (hazard ratio for each quartile increment in endotoxin levels, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.07-1.43)., CONCLUSION: Among children at risk of atopy, early exposure to high levels of dust mite allergen is associated with increased risks of asthma and late-onset wheeze. In these children, endotoxin exposure is associated with a reduced risk of atopy but an increased risk of wheeze., CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Early endotoxin exposure may be a protective factor against atopy but a risk factor for wheeze in high-risk children.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Perinatal problems may be associated with an increased risk for psychological and physical health problems in adulthood, although it is unclear which perinatal problems (low birthweight, preterm birth, low Apgar scores, and small head circumference), or what clusters of problems, are more likely to be associated with later health problems. It is also not known whether perinatal problems (singly or together) are associated with co-morbidity between psychological and physical health problems., METHOD: A regional random sample (from Baltimore) of mothers and their children (n=1525) was followed from birth to adulthood (mean age 29 years). Perinatal conditions were measured at delivery. Psychological problems (depression and suicidal ideation) were measured with the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28) and physical problems (asthma and hypertension) with the RAND-36 Health Status Inventory., RESULTS: Children with perinatal problems were generally at increased risk for depression, suicidal ideation and hypertension, and co-morbid depression and hypertension even after controlling for confounders. One possible underlying condition, preterm low birthweight (LBW), extracted by cluster analysis, considering all of the four perinatal problems, was associated with increased risk for psychological and physical health outcomes as well as co-morbidity of the two., CONCLUSIONS: LBW, preterm birth and small head circumference singly increased the risk for both psychological and physical health problems, as well as co-morbid depression and hypertension, while low Apgar scores were only associated with psychological problems. Delineating different etiological processes, such as preterm LBW, considering various perinatal problems simultaneously, might be of benefit to understanding the fetal origin of adult illness and co-morbidity.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Lack of a United Kingdom (UK) fatal asthma registry has resulted in few recent analyses regarding patient characteristics, co-morbidities, and admission type in relation to mortality post an asthma admission. This study aims to report these factors in addition to season of event for the years 2000-2005 to provide data regarding asthma burden in the in-patient hospital setting., METHODS: Data were analysed from the CHKS database collated from UK National Health Service data providing 70% of in-patient coverage in the UK. Patients with admissions under ICD-10 codes J45 "Asthma" and J46 "acute severe asthma" were included. Codes for associated co-morbidity at time of admission were identified, as well as month of admission and death, age, gender and length of stay., RESULTS: The mortality rate over the 5-year period was 1063 patients from 250,043 asthma admissions (0.43%). Critical care mortality was far higher and an annual rate indicated that for every 100,000 admissions 2878 (95% CI 2091;3857) patients died. Respiratory infection, cardiovascular disease and diabetes were common co-morbidities for all admissions. December and January had the peak number of deaths post asthma admission which were nearly all in adults, death being rarer in children. Women and those over 45 years had the highest rate of death which may reflect asthma prevalence., CONCLUSIONS: Co-morbid conditions experienced by older asthma patients may contribute to mortality post an asthma admission and greater understanding of risk factors contributing to fatality are required.

N2  - Many epidemiological studies suggest that women are at increased risk of developing adult-onset asthma and also suffer from more severe disease than men. These gender differences appear to be the product of biological sex differences as well as sociocultural and environmental differences. The biological sex differences include genetic, pulmonary, and immunological factors. There is compelling evidence that sex hormones are major determinants of at least these biological sex differences. This paper explores the current literature regarding effects of sex hormones on immune function, resident lung cells, and regulation of local processes in the lung to shed light on underlying mechanisms of gender differences in asthma. More research is needed to understand these mechanisms in order to improve treatment of women with asthma.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Asthma is the most common chronic childhood illness. Treatment is typically focused on disease management rather than developmental and behavioral comorbidities that may affect quality of life or contribute to poor disease control. The purpose of this study was to explore the prevalence of developmental and behavioral comorbidities of asthma and the role of confounding socioeconomic factors., METHODS: The first National Survey of Children's Health was the data source for this study. Interviews with parents or guardians were conducted during 2003-2004 to ascertain the physical, emotional, and behavioral health of 102,353 randomly selected children ages 0-17 years. Associations were examined between asthma and rates of developmental and behavioral problems. Logistic regression was used to adjust for potential confounding effects of age, gender, race, income, and parent education on outcomes., RESULTS: Children with asthma have higher rates of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; diagnoses of depression, behavioral disorders, learning disabilities; and missed school days (all p < .0001). The more severe the asthma is, the higher the rates are of these problems. Children with asthma are bullied more commonly and are more likely to abuse drugs. When socioeconomic factors are controlled for, asthma significantly increases the odds of having developmental, emotional, and behavioral problems., CONCLUSIONS: Children with asthma, especially severe asthma, are at high risk of developmental, emotional, and behavioral problems. Asthma is independently associated with these problems, although socioeconomic disadvantage adds additional risk. Asthma treatment programs must acknowledge and address these comorbidities to achieve the best overall outcomes for children with this common chronic disease.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To address the major methodological issues of reverse causation and selection bias in epidemiologic studies of antibiotic use in early life and the development of asthma, we undertook a cohort study of this association in a complete population of children., METHODS: Using the health-care and prescription databases of Manitoba, Canada, this longitudinal study assessed the association between antibiotic prescription use during the first year of life and asthma at age 7 years in a 1995 birth cohort of 13,116 children., RESULTS: Independent of well-known asthma risk factors, asthma was significantly more likely to develop in children who had received antibiotics in the first year of life at age 7 years. The association with asthma was observed for antibiotic use in non-respiratory tract infections (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 3.37). The risk of asthma was highest in children receiving more than four courses of antibiotics (adjusted OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.88), especially among rural children, and in the absence of maternal asthma or a dog in the birth year. Broad-spectrum (BS) cephalosporin use was more common in these subpopulations of children., CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic use in early life was associated with the development of childhood asthma, a risk that may be reduced by avoiding the use of BS cephalosporins.

N2  - BACKGROUND: We examined the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in loci encoding surfactant protein A (SFTPA) and risk of wheeze and persistent cough during the first year of life among a cohort of infants at risk for developing asthma., METHODS: Between September 1996 and December 1998, mothers of newborn infants were invited to participate if they had an older child with clinician-diagnosed asthma. Each mother was given a standardized questionnaire within 4 months of her infant's birth. Infant respiratory symptoms were collected during quarterly telephone interviews at 6, 9 and 12 months of age. Due to the association of SFTPA polymorphisms and race/ethnicity, analyses were restricted to 221 white infants for whom whole blood and respiratory data were available. Ordered logistic regression models were used to examine the association between respiratory symptom frequency and SFTPA haplotypes., RESULTS: The 6A allele haplotype of SFTPA1, with an estimated frequency of 6% among our study infants, was associated with an increased risk of persistent cough (OR 3.69, 95% CI 1.71, 7.98) and wheeze (OR 4.72, 95% CI 2.20, 10.11). The 6A/1A haplotype of SFTPA, found among approximately 5% of the infants, was associated with an increased risk of persistent cough (OR 3.20, 95% CI 1.39, 7.36) and wheeze (OR 3.25, 95% CI 1.43, 7.37)., CONCLUSION: Polymorphisms within SFTPA loci may be associated with wheeze and persistent cough in white infants at risk for asthma. These associations require replication and exploration in other ethnic/racial groups.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of asthma is associated with both genetic and environmental factors. Allergen sensitization is an important risk factor in asthma development., AIM: To evaluate sensitivity to allergens by using the skin prick test in patients with a diagnosis of bronchial asthma., METHOD: Patients with a diagnosis of bronchial asthma followed-up at the Ministry of Health, Diskapi Children's Diseases Training and Research Hospital in Ankara (Turkey) between January 1995 and March 2000 were included. Sensitivity to allergens, as determined by the skin prick test, was evaluated retrospectively., RESULTS: The files of a total of 3025 children (63.3 % boys) with bronchial asthma, aged 3 months to 16 years were evaluated. Of the total, 1667 patients with a diagnosis of bronchial asthma and 1358 with bronchial asthma plus allergic rhinitis were under follow-up. Of the 3025 asthmatic patients, 1902 had undergone the skin prick test and 60.3 % of these patients were atopic. The most common allergens were house dust mite [726 patients (63.3 %)], followed by pollens [565 patients (49.3 %)]. The most common allergen within this group was grass pollens [348 patients (30.3 %)]., CONCLUSIONS: Atopy was an important risk factor in our patients and the most common allergens were aeroallegens. The development of sensitization could be delayed by early precautions.

N2  - Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death worldwide. Hundreds of millions of individuals still smoke, affecting their health as well as that of their peers, family and offspring. Smoking is a well-established prime risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hampers the response to treatment in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In the present paper, new concepts are discussed with respect to pathology, treatment, smoking cessation and tobacco control. Recommendations for future directions are given.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Studies on airway remodeling in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) may be hampered by difficulty in obtaining evaluable endobronchial biopsy specimens because of large amounts of mucus and inflammation in the CF airway. We prospectively assessed how the quality of biopsy specimens obtained from children with CF compare with those from children with other airway diseases., METHODS: Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with endobronchial biopsy was performed in 67 CF children (age range, 0.2 to 16.8 years), 34 children with wheeze/asthma (W/A), and 64 control children with chronic respiratory symptoms. Up to three biopsy specimens were taken and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Biopsy specimen size and structural composition were quantified using stereology., RESULTS: At least one evaluable biopsy specimen was obtained in 72% of CF children, in 79% of children with W/A, and in 72% of control subjects (difference was not significant). The use of large biopsy forceps (2.0 mm) rather than small biopsy forceps (1.0 mm) [odds ratio (OR), 5.8; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1 to 29.8; p = 0.037] and the number of biopsy specimens taken (odds ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 5.2; p = 0.006) significantly contributed to the success rate. Biopsy size and composition were similar between groups, except that CF children and those patients with W/A had a higher percentage of the biopsy specimen composed of muscle than did control subjects (median 6.2% and 9.7% vs 0.9%, respectively; p = 0.002)., CONCLUSIONS: Biopsy size and quality are adequate for the study of airway remodeling in CF children as young as 2 months of age. Researchers should use large forceps when possible and take at least two biopsy specimens per patient. An increased airway smooth muscle content of the airway mucosa may contribute to the pathophysiology of CF lung disease.

N2  - OBJECTIVE AND BACKGROUND: Reattendance rates at hospitals and emergency departments (ED) can provide a valuable marker of the quality and effectiveness of clinical care. Linked hospital and ED data from New South Wales and Victoria, Australia, were used to examine reattendances for asthma., METHODS: Hospital and ED data were linked to identify individuals who reattended hospital or ED for asthma within 28 days of an initial attendance. The sociodemographic characteristics that predicted reattendance were examined using logistic regression., RESULTS: There were 139,043 attendances for asthma between July 2000 and June 2003 attributed to 95,042 people. Overall, 7.1% of people reattended for asthma within 28 days. There was a significantly higher risk of reattendance among females (odds ratio (OR) 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-1.14), people who lived in areas of greater socioeconomic disadvantage (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.12-1.29) and Indigenous people (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.00-1.32). Reattendance rates differed among age groups (P < 0.001), with the lowest rate being in 5- to 14-year-olds., CONCLUSION: The availability of linked hospital and ED data has provided a rare opportunity to investigate predictors of reattendance for asthma. Surveillance of trends in reattendances for asthma can be used to monitor the effectiveness of interventions to improve asthma control across the continuum of care, particularly in higher-risk groups such as Indigenous people, young children and those with greater socioeconomic disadvantage.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the conjoined effects of low birth weight (LBW) and childhood abuse on impaired adaptation and illness in adolescence and adulthood., DESIGN: Longitudinal study of a birth cohort., SETTING: Baltimore, Md., PARTICIPANTS: Children (N = 1748) were followed from birth to adulthood (mean age, 26 years) as part of the Johns Hopkins Collaborative Perinatal Study., MAIN EXPOSURES: Childhood abuse and LBW., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Indicators of adaptation were delinquency, school suspension, repeating grades, academic honors, quality of life, and socioeconomic status. Indicators of psychiatric and medical problems were depression, social dysfunction, somatization, asthma, and hypertension., RESULTS: Participants with both LBW and subsequent childhood abuse, relative to those with neither risk, were at a substantially elevated risk for psychological problems: 10-fold for depression; nearly 9-fold for social dysfunction, and more than 4-fold for somatization. However, they were not at an elevated risk for medical problems in adulthood. Those exposed to childhood abuse were more likely to report delinquency, school suspension, repeating grades during adolescence, and impaired well-being in adulthood, regardless of LBW status. For those with LBW alone, the prevalence of those problems was comparable with that of individuals without either risk factor., CONCLUSIONS: Children with LBW and childhood abuse are at much greater risk for poor adaptation and psychiatric problems than those with LBW alone and those with neither risk. Preventive interventions should target families with LBW children who are at greater risk for childhood abuse.

N2  - Atopic manifestations may be present from infancy to adolescence. Atopic dermatitis represents the first clinical manifestation followed by allergic symptoms of the upper or lower airways. IgE responses to alimentary or environmental allergens are hallmarks of atopy in childhood. Characteristically infantile IgE responses to cow's milk and hen's egg are the first immunological markers of atopy. In many cases they are followed by IgE responses to indoor or outdoor allergens, which suggests a high risk for the development of persistent asthma in childhood. During recent years a variety of genes for both asthma and atopic dermatitis have been described. Infantile diet, early exposure to environmental allergens and a variety of environmental and lifestyle factors may act as strong modulators of atopy during the first decade of life.

The present authors studied the association by carrying out careful home inspections among new, clinically determined cases of asthma and controls. New cases of asthma aged 12-84 months (n = 121) were recruited prospectively and matched for year of birth, sex and living area with two randomly selected population controls (n = 241). Trained engineers visited all homes. Both cases and controls had lived >or=75% of their lifetime or the past 2 yrs in their current home. Risk of asthma increased with severity of moisture damage and presence of visible mould in the main living quarters but not in other areas of the house. Cases more often had damage in their bedroom. Associations were comparable for atopic and nonatopic asthma and for children aged >30 months or <or=30 months. The present results, using standardised assessment of exposure and asthma, suggest that moisture damage and mould growth in the main living quarters are associated with the development of asthma in early childhood.

T1  - Asthma is associated with preterm birth but not with small for gestational age status among a population-based cohort of Medicaid-enrolled children <10 years of age.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Few population-based studies have evaluated the association between birth weight or gestation and subsequent clinically significant asthma., METHODS: Birth records of 37 349 Alaska residents <10 years of age who were enrolled in Medicaid for at least 365 days during 1999-2002 were linked to a Medicaid billing file. The occurrence of asthma and lower respiratory infections during the study period was categorised on the basis of standard International Classification of Diseases 9th Revision codes. The association between gestational age or small for gestational age status and asthma outcomes was adjusted for recent history of lower respiratory infection, years of Medicaid enrolment, age at enrolment and a variety of birth-related factors., RESULTS: Among children <5 years of age, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for developing asthma decreased by 5.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.2 to 10.9) and 7.9% (95% CI 5.2 to 10.4) per additional week of gestational age for children without and with any lower respiratory tract infection, respectively. For children > or =5 years of age, the adjusted OR for developing asthma decreased by 3.4% (95% CI -2.8 to 9.8) and 3.7% (95% CI -2.0 to 9.2) per additional week of gestation for those without and with lower respiratory tract infection, respectively. Among all children with asthma, the adjusted OR for hospitalisation due to asthma decreased by 6.9% (95% CI 2.1 to 11.5) for each additional week of gestational age. Small for gestational age status was not significantly associated with asthma outcomes., CONCLUSIONS: Preterm birth but not small for gestational age status predicted subsequent asthma outcomes. Adverse effects of preterm birth on asthma outcomes persist beyond age 5 years.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the influence that hospital admission of suckling infants with asthma has on their risk for future admissions for the same cause., METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted, in which the charts of 202 patients, all less than fifteen years of age, were evaluated. All of the patients had been treated as outpatients in a pediatric pulmonology clinic and had been admitted to the hospital on one or more occasions. A multivariate analysis was conducted in order to evaluate the risk factors associated with multiple hospitalizations., RESULTS: Virtually all of the patients evaluated were hospitalized a second time within 18 months of the first hospitalization. Among the patients first hospitalized at = 12 months of age, the second admission occurred sooner than did that recorded for those first hospitalized at > 12 months of age (p = 0.001). The risk factors found to be associated with multiple hospital admissions were as follows: age at first admission = 12 months (odds ratio: 2.55; 95% confidence interval: 1.18-5.48); age at first admission between 13 and 24 months (odds ratio: 3.54; 95% confidence interval: 1.31-9.63); and severity of asthma symptoms (odds ratio: 3.86; 95% confidence interval: 2.02-7.40)., CONCLUSION: After the first hospitalization, children with asthma should be closely monitored, since the risk of subsequent admissions is elevated in the first months following discharge, especially among those of less than two years of age. Health care facilities should be organized to confront this problem appropriately and should dispense prophylactic medication more freely.

T1  - Respiratory viral infections and early asthma in childhood.
A1  - Oh, Jae-Won
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Respiratory viral infections profoundly influence the disease activity of wheezing illnesses and asthma in early childhood. Viral bronchiolitis shares many features with asthma and a subset of children develop recurrent wheezing after their initial illness. Recently mechanisms for virus-induced exacerbations of childhood asthma are beginning to be focused on and defined. Viruses cause systemic immune activation and also produce local inflammation. These factors are likely to affect airway pathogenesis leading to airway narrowing, an increase in mucus production, and eventually bronchospasm, and airway obstruction. These new insights related to the pathogenesis and disease activity are likely to provide new targets for the therapy and prevention of early asthma in childhood.

N2  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate the early determinants and characteristics of different phenotypes of wheeze in children on the basis of questionnaire data, lung function, and prick tests., DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. Setting. Rome and Fiumicino municipalities in Lazio region, Italy, within the ISAAC phase II project., SUBJECTS: Sample of 2107 9-11 year old schoolchildren (response rate 83.5%)., RESULTS: We divided children into four mutually exclusive groups according to onset of wheeze: 154 early transient (birth to age 2), 51 persistent (birth to age 2 and current), 66 late onset (current only), and 1,446 control subjects (no early or current wheeze). Logistic regression models have shown that a family history of asthma and allergies is strongly associated with persistent and late onset wheezing; exposure to parental smoking--both during pregnancy and during the child's first year of life--is related to persistent wheezing; all children with wheezing show a significantly greater risk to have current respiratory symptoms other than wheeze compared with control subjects; current allergic rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms and atopy are related with both persistent and late onset wheeze. Multiple linear regression models show that forced expiratory rates at 25% to 75% of vital capacity (FEF25-75) and the ratio between forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) are significantly lower both in early transient (-305 mL/s, -1.7%) and persistent (-298 mL/s, -3.2%) wheezers; FEV1/FVC is significantly reduced in late onset wheezers too (-2.0%)., CONCLUSIONS: The strength of the association of family history and exposure to parental smoking varies with the three wheezing phenotypes. Moreover, early, persistent and late onset wheezers have different clinical characteristics in terms of their respiratory health and atopic status.

N2  - Childhood asthma is a heterogeneous inflammatory disease with several wheezing phenotypes (transient, atopic, nonatopic, and obese) and various clinical expressions of multifactorial origin. All forms, however, follow a similar course characterized by recurrent episodes of airway obstruction. Studies have shown that the onset of disease occurs early in life for the great majority of asthmatics, that airway inflammation and remodeling are present in schoolchildren with asthma, and that even infants with persistent wheezing present airway inflammation. The difficulty lies in the early identification of infants with recurrent wheezing who are at risk of suffering persistent asthma later in life. The Asthma Predictive Index, a simple tool validated in a longitudinal study, has been suggested for early identification of infants with recurrent wheezing who are at risk of developing asthma and whose lung function has undergone major irreversible damage during the first years of life.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence suggests that reduced duration of pregnancy predicts increased risk of asthma, but the studies published have been inconsistent., OBJECTIVE: We sought to synthesize the evidence on the relation between preterm delivery and the risk of asthma later in life and to assess differences between the studies as potential sources for heterogeneity of the results., METHODS: We conducted a MEDLINE search (until the end of May 2005). The outcome was asthma. The determinant of interest was preterm delivery defined as a gestational age of less than 37 weeks., RESULTS: We identified 19 articles that provided estimates for the meta-analysis. The summary effect estimates for asthma (fixed-effects odds ratio, 1.074 [95% CI, 1.072-1.075]; heterogeneity P = .000; random-effects odds ratio, 1.366 [95% CI, 1.303-1.432]) showed an increased risk in relation to preterm delivery, with substantial heterogeneity between study-specific estimates. The effect of preterm delivery on asthma was stronger in cross-sectional studies; studies with broad outcome criteria, a small sample size, and a younger study population; and studies conducted in English-speaking populations, outside Europe, and published more recently. In metaregression, adjusting for other determinants, the effect estimate was significantly associated only with the mean age of the study population., CONCLUSIONS: The weight of evidence shows that preterm babies have an increased risk of asthma compared with term babies., CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Recognition of prematurity as a determinant of asthma emphasizes the importance of active treatment of physiologic airflow obstruction and a need for special preventive measures against known environmental determinants of asthma in preterm babies.

T1  - Is affluence a risk factor for bronchial asthma and type 1 diabetes?.
A1  - Tedeschi, Alberto
A1  - Airaghi, Lorena
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - In the last decades, an increase in bronchial asthma and type 1 diabetes occurrence has been observed in affluent countries, and a positive association between the two disorders has been demonstrated at the population level. This association could be explained by common risk factors predisposing to both disorders. Altered environmental and lifestyle conditions, possibly related to socio-economic status, might account for the rising trend of the two disorders. To test this hypothesis, we calculated the correlation between the occurrence of type 1 diabetes and asthma, the gross national product (GNP) and the infant mortality rate, in several European and extra-European countries. GNP was positively correlated with the incidence of type 1 diabetes and with symptoms of asthma in European (r(sp): 0.53 and 0.69; p = 0.001 and p < 0.0001, respectively) and extra-European countries (r(sp): 0.44 and 0.46; p = 0.04 for both diseases). Infant mortality rate was inversely correlated with GNP and with the occurrences of the two diseases in Europe (r(sp): -0.66, p < 0.0001 for type 1 diabetes; r(sp):- 0.51, p = 0.01 for asthma). In extra-European countries, a significant relationship was found between infant mortality and asthma (r(sp): -0.46; p = 0.03); a trend towards a negative correlation between infant mortality and type 1 diabetes was also found, although no statistical significance was reached (r(sp): -0.21; p = 0.31). This analysis indicates that type 1 diabetes and asthma are positively associated with the GNP at the population level. Similarly, countries with low infant mortality rates tend to have a higher incidence of these immune-mediated diseases. Although GNP reflects many societal and lifestyle differences, it is notable that a high socio-economic status implies a reduced or delayed exposure to infectious agents. The reduced pressure of infectious agents on the immune system throughout life might contribute to increase the susceptibility to bronchial asthma and type 1 diabetes.

N2  - To investigate potential associations between several autoimmune diseases and haematological malignancies, we studied 39,908 cases of leukaemia, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and myeloma that occurred during 1987-1999 in Sweden, and 149,344 controls. Hospital discharge diagnoses of psoriasis, Sjogren's syndrome, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, pernicious anaemia, multiple sclerosis, rheumatic fever or asthma from 1969 to 1999 were retrieved from the Swedish Hospital Discharge Registry. Psoriasis was positively associated with leukaemia, excluding chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, (odds ratio [OR]=1.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-2.3) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (OR=1.6, 95% CI 1.3-2.1). Sjogren's syndrome increased the risks of all haematological malignancies combined (OR=4.0, 95% CI 2.3-7.0), and of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (OR=6.4, 95% CI 3.5-12). These findings, together with increased risks of several haematological malignancies in autoimmune haemolytic anaemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura but not in asthma, suggest chronic autoimmunity and immune stimulation as mechanisms contributing to the development of haematological malignancies.

N2  - A total of 167 children with bronchial asthma (BA) have been examined for the mycoplasma infection rate. Among investigated patients 62,8% were infected with one or more mycoplasma species. The prolonged persistence in patient body as well as biological properties of mycoplasmas give grounds to consider these agents as a risk factor in the development of the allergy-infection-borne BA and its relapses.

T1  - Wheezing and eczema in relation to infant anthropometry: evidence of developmental programming of disease in childhood.
A1  - Carrington, Lynda J
A1  - Langley-Evans, Simon C
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Early life factors and, in particular, the fetal environment have been suggested to programme risk of allergic disease in later life. Diversion of nutrients away from immune organs towards the brain, a process termed brain sparing, has been proposed as a mechanism underpinning this association. The study population was a group of 256 seven-year old children from the UK recruited from two general practitioner surgeries. Historical anthropometric data from birth to age three and current anthropometry were assessed as predictors of parent-reported wheeze and eczema. Eczema at seven years was not related to any anthropometric indices at birth or during infancy. A smaller head circumference at 10-15 days of age was noted in children with current wheeze at age 7 years (P = 0.018) and this relationship persisted after adjustment for current anthropometry and confounders. Comparison of children with head circumference over 36.5 cm at 10-15 days with those with head circumference under 35.5 cm, showed reduced odds for wheeze at 7 years (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.03-0.44, P(trend) = 0.009). These data suggest that factors that determine fetal growth may be associated with wheeze in childhood and support the developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis. Brain sparing does not appear to play a role in this early life programming.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Little is known about the natural history of wheezing disorders among children at risk for atopy. We examined the relation between early wheeze and asthma at 7 years of age among children with parental history of asthma or allergies followed from birth., METHODS: Information on wheeze was collected bimonthly from birth to age 24 months and every 6 months thereafter. Recurrent early wheeze was defined as > or =2 reports of wheezing in the first 3 years of life. Frequent early wheeze was defined as > or =2 reports of wheezing per year in the first 3 years of life. At 7 years of age, asthma was defined as physician-diagnosed asthma and wheezing in the previous year., RESULTS: Of the 440 participating children, 223 (50.7%) had > or =1 report of wheeze before 3 years old, 111 (26.0%) had recurrent early wheeze, and 12 (2.7%) had frequent early wheeze. Whereas only 31 (13.9%) of 223 children with > or =1 report of wheeze developed asthma at 7 years of age, 24 (21.6%) of 111 children with recurrent early wheeze developed asthma at 7 years of age. Among the 12 children with frequent early wheeze, 6 (50%) had asthma at 7 years of age. After adjustment for other covariates, recurrent early wheeze in children at risk for atopy was associated with a fourfold increase in the odds of asthma at 7 years of age, and frequent early wheeze was associated with an approximately 12-fold increase in the odds of asthma at 7 years of age. Most (94%) of the children without frequent early wheeze did not develop asthma at 7 years of age., CONCLUSIONS: The absence of recurrent early wheeze indicates a very low risk of asthma at school age among children with parental history of asthma or allergies. Early identification of children who will develop asthma at school age is difficult, even in children at risk for atopy. However, children with parental history of asthma or allergies who have frequent early wheeze, in particular, are at greatly increased risk of asthma and merit close clinical follow-up.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigates whether racial/ethnic disparities in childhood asthma prevalence can be explained by differences in family and neighborhood socioeconomic position (SEP)., METHODS: Data were from the 2001 Rhode Island Health Interview Survey (RI HIS), a statewide representative sample of 2,600 Rhode Island households, and the 2000 U.S. Census. A series of weighted multivariate models were fitted using generalized estimating equations (GEE) for the logistic case to analyze the independent and joint effects of race/ethnicity and SEP on doctor-diagnosed asthma among 1,769 white, black and Hispanic children <18 years old., RESULTS: Compared with white children, black children were at increased odds for asthma and this effect persisted when measures of family and neighborhood SEP were included in multivariate models (AOR: 2.49; 95% Cl: 1.30-4.77). Black children living in poverty neighborhoods had substantially higher odds of asthma than Hispanic and white children in poverty areas and children in moderate- and high-income neighborhoods (AOR: 3.20: 95% Cl: 1.62-6.29)., CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of asthma among black children in poor neighborhoods is consistent with previous research on higher-than-average prevalence of childhood asthma in poor urban minority communities. Changing neighborhood social structures that contribute to racial disparities in asthma prevalence remains a challenge.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To examine differences in asthma prevalence and emergency department (ED) visits for asthma between non-Hispanic black and white children, and factors that might explain those differences, in a large, nationally representative sample covering the period 1997 to 2003., METHODS: Bivariate and multivariate regression analyses (with logit and multinomial logit methods) were conducted with a sample consisting of all non-Hispanic black and white children (<18 years of age) from the 1997 to 2003 rounds of the National Health Interview Survey. Models included a progressively larger set of controls for factors that might explain racial differences in asthma prevalence and ED visits for asthma., RESULTS: Being black was associated with a greater likelihood of currently having asthma and with a greater likelihood of having gone to the ED for asthma treatment in the past 1 year. Elevated asthma risks for black children were robust after controlling for a host of child and family characteristics that might explain them., CONCLUSIONS: Black children are more likely to have asthma and to experience ED visits for asthma, compared with otherwise comparable white children, and these racial disparities cannot be explained by differences in measurable child or family characteristics. These results suggest that racial disparities in asthma continue to pose risks for black children, and they point to the need for additional research into potential explanations and remedies.

N2  - Case representative selective study of children from 1 to 15 years old age in Batumi, with 2110 children population has been carried out. Risk factors were studied by interviewing method, using two step estimation (on the basis of primary and secondary questionnaire) of the disease developing risk. For statistical analysis of the data SPSS v. 12 was used. Study findings confirm causal connection (with high relative risk) and significant probability of the disease (with high attributive risk), with "major risk factors": allergic diseases and atopic dermatitis in relatives and with "minor risk factors": allergic rhinitis. Relatively weak risk factors (with low relative risk), but with high prevalence in child population in Batumi were found: respiratory infections and bottle-feeding. Revealing individual and population risk phenomenology of bronchial asthma in children population in Batumi, on the basis of that the most of risk factors can be monitored, will promote asthma prevention and population health care, which is more rational and cost-effective.

N2  - The epidemiology of asthma is complex but essential in enhancing the understanding of a disease that affects millions of patients. Asthma is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Asthma prevalence rates in the United States reached a plateau after 1998 with an estimated overall prevalence of 3.8% in 2003. Racial disparities exist and there are staggering differences in morbidity and mortality. The analysis of data collected from epidemiologic studies continues to be a critical part of enhancing the understanding of the pathophysiology of asthma, which will lead to improved patient outcomes.

N2  - UNLABELLED: Bronchial asthma is a public health problem with gradually increasing importance, affecting more than 100 million individuals worldwide and found independently of the level of development of the country. Factors related to lifestyle and the environment form the basis for the increase in the prevalence of the disease., AIM: To evaluate our patients being followed-up with a diagnosis of bronchial asthma at the Allergy Clinic for risk factors and to determine their sociodemographic characteristics., MATERIAL AND METHOD: The risk factors of 3025 patients followed-up with a diagnosis of bronchial asthma at the Allergy Clinic of the Ministry of Health, Ankara Diskapi Children's Diseases Training and Research Hospital between January 1995 and March 2000 were evaluated retrospectively., RESULTS: A high percentage of our patients suffered from both asthma and allergic rhinitis and 45% of our asthmatic patients had allergic rhinitis while 93.5% of those with allergic rhinitis were also asthmatic. Asthma was more common in males and those born in the summer months. 57.6% of the patients had a history of atopy. Passive smoking was observed at a high rate and cigarette smoke was the most important factor increasing the symptoms. The symptoms increased during the winter. 92.8% of the patients lived in the city. The average Ig E level was high and 60.9% of the patients were atopic on the skin prick test., RESULTS: Asthma seems to be an important health problem in our country. Recognizing the risk factors is important for the diagnosis and prevention of the disease.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if recurrent community acquired pneumonia (RP) is a risk factor for developing childhood asthma (CA), compared with those children who only suffer one episode of pneumonia or non-recurrent pneumonia (NRP). To determine if patients with CA are more disposed to suffer RP., DESIGN: Historical cohort study., SETTING: Primary care., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 80 episodes of pneumonia identified in 65 infants between the 1st of February 1996 and 30th June 1999., PRINCIPAL MEASUREMENTS: The relative risk (RR) and confidence interval (95% CI) of childhood asthma in the presence of recurrent pneumonia as compared to non-recurrent pneumonia, and the RR of recurrent pneumonia in the presence of childhood asthma., RESULTS: Of the 65 children included, 18 had RP (27.7%; 95% CI, 16.8-38.6). The prevalence of CA was 49.2% (32 children) (95% CI, 37.1-61.4). The diagnosis of CA at any time was higher in children with RP (RR=4.1; 95% CI, 1.9-8.9). There were no differences between the incidence of RP and NRP in children previously diagnosed with CA (RR=1.28; 95% CI, 0.5-3.0)., CONCLUSIONS: A special follow-up needs to be carried out on all children diagnosed with RP in primary care, since the possibility of presenting with CA is higher in these cases.

Regarding to the 'hygiene-hypothesis', day-care attendance may lead to less sensitization later in life, but the question still is whether day-care attendance and subsequent exposure to more frequent early infections is a risk or a protection against future allergic disease or asthma (atopic and nonatopic)., METHODS: A cross-sectional postal questionnaire was replied by parents of 10,851 children, aged 1-6 years, in the year 2000 in a Swedish region (DBH-phase 1). The questionnaire focused on respiratory and atopic symptoms, the home environment and information on day care of the children., RESULTS: Children in day care were reported to have more symptoms than children in home care: adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for wheezing last 12 months, AOR 1.33 (CI 95%: 1.12-1.58), cough at night apart from colds last 12 months AOR 1.56 (CI: 1.17-2.07), doctor diagnosed asthma AOR 1.23 (CI: 0.88-1.71), rhinitis last 12 months AOR 1.15 (CI: 0.92-1.44), doctor diagnosed hay fever AOR 1.75 (CI: 0.94-3.23), eczema last 12 months, AOR 1.49 (CI: 1.24-1.79), allergic reactions to foods, AOR 1.27 (CI: 1.07-1.52), >6 colds last 12 months of 2.57 (CI: 2.12-3.12) and ear infection ever AOR 2.14 (CI: 1.87-2.45). The increased risks were mainly seen and reached significance in the youngest group of children, aged 1-4 years. Adjusting and stratification for the number of airway infections last year did not change the risk associated with day-care attendance for allergic diseases., CONCLUSIONS: Attending day care was associated with an increased risk of symptoms related to airways infections as well with eczema and allergic reactions to food. No sign of protection from day-care attendance for allergic diseases was found up to 6 years of age. Multiple airway infections and day-care attendance were found to be independently associated with asthma and allergic symptoms.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Factors associated with early asthma readmission have not been fully studied. To identify predictors of early readmission, we performed a matched case-control study of children discharged with primary diagnosis of asthma. Cases were readmitted with asthma within 30 days of discharge. Controls were not readmitted. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used. History of asthma hospitalization within the past 12 months was an independent predictor of early readmission (OR 1.89, p = 0.021). Modifiable factors such as medical treatment and management during and upon discharge from the index admission did not predict early asthma readmission.

T1  - Additive models for geo-referenced failure time data.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Asthma researchers have found some evidence that geographical variations in susceptibility to asthma could reflect the effect of community level factors such as exposure to violence. Our methodology was motivated by a study of age at onset of asthma among children of inner-city neighbourhoods in East Boston. Cox's proportional hazards model was not appropriate since there was not enough information about the nature of geographical variations so as to impose a parametric relationship. In addition, some of the known risk factors were believed to have non-linear log-hazard ratios. We extend the geoadditive models of Kamman and Wand to the case where the outcome measure is a possibly censored time to event. We reduce the problem to one of fitting a Poisson mixed model by using Poisson approximations in conjunction with a mixed model formulation of generalized additive modelling. Our method allows for low-rank additive modelling, provides likelihood-based estimation of all parameters including the amount of smoothing and can be implemented using standard software. We illustrate our method on the East Boston data.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - OBJECTIVES: To review the recent medical literature on environmental chemical hazards to child health., SOURCES OF DATA: Articles published on this subject between 1999 and 2005 were searched in the MEDLINE database. Books, manuals and statements on child environmental health, issued by institutions such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization, were also reviewed., SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS: There has been a growing concern in the last few years with the exposure of children to environmental chemicals. Around 85,000 synthetic chemicals are produced today, and 2,800 of them are mass-produced. There is little knowledge regarding their effects on developing organisms. Children have a greater exposure to environmental pollutants than adults, because their metabolic needs and behaviors (e.g.: crawling, bringing objects to the mouth, playing closer to the ground) put them at special risk of contact with chemicals when they breathe, eat, drink or play. Heavy metals, pesticides, persistent organic pollutants and, at home, environmental tobacco smoke have been associated with the increasing number of diseases such as asthma, neurodevelopmental disorders and childhood cancer., CONCLUSION: Screening of risk situations using tools such as Environmental History has been stimulated alongside a greater commitment of pediatricians towards measures that can reduce the exposure of children and adolescents to environmental chemicals.

A1  - Cloutier, Michelle M
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To examine asthma diagnosis, asthma severity, and the presence of established asthma risk factors in children who reside in nonurban communities., DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted of 19,076 children (6 months to 18 years of age) who lived in 146 nonurban communities in the greater Hartford, CT, region and who were enrolled in a disease-management program (Easy Breathing II; Michelle Cloutier, MD; Hartford, CT) designed to improve asthma diagnosis and treatment., RESULTS: The overall frequency of physician-confirmed asthma in children seeking health care was 18%. Asthma frequency was related to low socioeconomic status (SES), non-Caucasian ethnicity, male gender, age > or = 5 years, and exposure to tobacco smoke, dust, or cockroaches in the multivariate analysis. When controlling for SES, African-American children were 1.33 times more likely (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15 to 1.53) and Hispanic children were 1.60 times as likely (95% CI, 1.38 to 1.85) as Caucasian children to have asthma. In contrast, asthma severity was related to dust exposure, a family history of asthma, non-Caucasian ethnicity, and age < or = 4 years in the multivariate analysis. African-American children (odds ratio, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.67) had more severe asthma diagnosed as compared to Caucasian children. Hispanic ethnicity was not associated with an increase in asthma severity., CONCLUSION: Risk factors for asthma in nonurban children are similar to risk factors in urban children. Ethnicity is a risk factor for asthma regardless of SES. Even in nonurban environments, African-American and Hispanic children have more asthma, and African-American children have more severe disease than their Caucasian counterparts.

N2  - Wheezing is a symptom, not a diagnosis. Wheezing disorders are not equal to childhood asthma. Wheezing in the youngest children is often episodic, associated with upper respiratory infection. Early wheezing disorders, particularly in the first 2-3 years of life, should be considered as largely independent of later childhood asthma. It is difficult to distinguish an initial episode of asthma triggered by a viral respiratory infection from acute viral bronchiolitis. Most of the infants with wheezing have transient conditions associated with diminished airway function at birth and do not have increased risks of asthma or allergies later in life. There is no evidence for an overall beneficial clinical effect of nebulized a2-agonists in acute severe wheezing episodes or acute bronchiolitis in infants, although some may seem to respond.

N2  - Asthma is commonly described as an atopic disease in childhood, but some cases of this disorder do not fit this description. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of atopy, asthma, and sensitization to house dust mites in children with allergic symptoms. This study was performed at the Severance Hospital of Yonsei University with patients who visited the allergy clinic for evaluation of nonspecific upper respiratory symptoms, typical symptoms of asthma, or a general health workup. The patients were divided into three age groups: 0-3 years (group 1), 4-7 years (group 2), and 8-12 years (group 3). Of the 1,244 children examined, 844 (67.8%) were atopic and 400 (32.2%) were non-atopic. The frequency of atopy and asthma increased with age. Asthma was diagnosed in the same proportion (64%) of atopic and non-atopic children. As risk factors for asthma symptoms, the positive values of house dust mite (HDM) sensitivity were significantly increased in groups 1, 2, and 3 to 53.5%, 68.9%, and 80.2%, respectively. A significant difference between the percentage of asthmatics sensitized to HDM and that of asthmatics not sensitized to HDM was found only in group 3. In conclusion, asthma is related to atopy with increasing age, and house dust mite sensitization seems to be an important determinant of asthma in older children in Korea.

N2  - Atopy is the genetic potential to manifest the trinity of classic allergic diseases--atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma. All have been observed to have increased over the past several decades. The interplay of the genetics of atopy with various environmental exposures may manifest itself in the form of allergic phenotypes or paradoxically may actually suppress the allergic response. The hygiene hypothesis offers an explanation of why certain environmental exposures early in life may suppress or activate clinical disease. Primary prevention is directed at preventing the clinical manifestations of atopy by suppressing or delaying the onset of allergic sensitivity. Studies of primary prevention have brought mixed results. Secondary prevention is directed at reducing or removing triggers in the environment of the sensitized individual. Secondary prevention measures directed at one allergen have not proven successful. Comprehensive intervention programs dealing with both allergens and other potential triggers appear beneficial.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: A retrospective case-control study at Monash Medical Centre (MMC), a tertiary referral hospital in Melbourne, Australia, was conducted to identify risk factors associated with very severe asthma in paediatric patients., METHODOLOGY: Asthmatics admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU; n=52) were identified and considered to represent cases of very severe/near fatal asthma (NFA group). This group was compared to asthmatics who had been admitted on one occasion only to the emergency department at MMC (non-NFA controls, n=53). Patient files were examined and factors that may be linked to NFA were recorded. Information not on file was obtained from patients/parents during a structured telephone interview. Data for the two groups were compared, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed, and odds ratios (OR) were calculated., RESULTS: Univariate analysis indicated that asthmatics with NFA were more likely to be older (P=0.01) and have a longer duration of asthma (P=0.02). They were also more likely to have hay fever (P=0.002; OR, 7.6), use inhaled corticosteroids (P=0.001), long acting beta(2) agonists (P=0.02), have an asthma management plan (P=0.006), and see a respiratory specialist (P=0.001). Parental smoking habits were not different between the groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified male gender (P=0.05; OR, 5.7) and use of inhaled corticosteroids (P=0.07; OR, 7.2) as factors that may be predictive of NFA., CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies a number of factors associated with NFA; many are similar to those reported in adult patients. Asthma severity explains some findings, but the data also suggest that additional independent risk factors such as gender and duration of asthma may operate in children.

T1  - Defining childhood atopic phenotypes to investigate the association of atopic sensitization with allergic disease.

N2  - AIMS: Although atopic sensitization is common in childhood, its relationship to clinical allergic disease remains incompletely understood. We therefore sought to explore this relationship by defining sensitization based atopic phenotypes., METHODS: Children were recruited at birth (n = 1456) and reviewed at 1, 2, 4 and 10 years. Skin prick testing (SPT) to common allergens was done at 4 (n = 980) and 10 years (n = 1036) with lung function (n = 981), bronchial challenge (n = 784) and serum IgE (n = 953) testing at 10. Atopic phenotypes were defined, by sensitization pattern, for children with SPT at both 4 and 10 years (n = 823)., RESULTS: Of phenotyped children, 68.0% were never atopic, 4.3% early childhood atopic (only atopic at age 4), 16.5% chronic childhood atopics (at 4 and 10 years) and 11.2% delayed childhood atopics (only at 10). Never atopics showed small but identifiable prevalence of allergic diseases such as asthma, eczema and rhinitis. Amongst allergen-sensitized subjects, aeroallergen predominated over food sensitization throughout childhood. Chronic childhood atopics showed highest prevalence of lifetime plus persistent wheeze, eczema and rhinitis, increased prevalence of aeroallergen sensitization, some evidence of persistent food sensitization, significantly greater cord IgE than never atopics (P = 0.006), plus higher total IgE (P < 0.001) and bronchial hyper-responsiveness (P < 0.001) at 10 years than other phenotypes., CONCLUSION: A proportion of childhood eczema, rhinitis and asthma is nonatopic. The commonest childhood pattern of atopy is chronic sensitization, associated with early, persisting and clinically significant allergic disease. The currently accepted childhood 'Allergic March' may oversimplify the natural history of childhood atopy and allergic disease.

N2  - In recent years some studies have focused attention on the contribution of early life risk factors in the pathogenesis of asthma and wheezing. In our study we tested the hypothesis that wheezing in childhood is not a single disorder and that different wheezing phenotypes (called transient early wheezing, persistent wheezing and late-onset wheezing) are associated with different risk factors. We evaluated the association between pre, perinatal and early life (1st year) risk factors and different wheezing phenotypes in children 6-7 years old enrolled in the SIDRIA-2 project. Maternal smoking in pregnancy is associated with early and persistent wheezing; prematurity, child's admission to hospital shortly after birth for respiratory problems, indicators of respiratory infections during the child's first year of life are associated with early wheezing. An increase in childhood infections from contact with siblings or day care attendance is a risk factor for early wheezing but protective against late-onset wheezing, while an opposite pattern was observed for breastfeeding. Finally, mould or dampness in the child's bedroom during his first year of life is associated with all wheezing phenotypes. The risk factors studied are differently associated with different wheezing phenotypes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Acute viral bronchiolitis is one of the most common causes of hospitalisation during infancy in our region with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) historically being the major causative agent. Many infants with early-life RSV bronchiolitis have sustained bronchial hyperreactivity for many years after hospitalisation and the reasons for this are probably multifactorial. The principal aim of the present study was to investigate if children hospitalised for any acute viral bronchiolitis during infancy in our region, and not only those due to RSV, had more episodes of subsequent wheezing up to age seven years and reduced lung function at that age compared to children not hospitalised for acute bronchiolitis during infancy. A secondary aim was to compare the hospitalised infants with proven RSV bronchiolitis (RS+) to the hospitalised infants with non-RSV bronchiolitis (RS-) according to the same endpoints., METHODS: 57 infants hospitalised at least once with acute viral bronchiolitis during two consecutive winter seasons in 1993-1994 were examined at age seven years. An age-matched control group of 64 children, who had not been hospitalised for acute viral bronchiolitis during infancy, were recruited from a local primary school. Epidemiological and clinical data were collected retrospectively from hospital discharge records and through structured clinical interviews and physical examinations at the follow-up visit., RESULTS: The children hospitalised for bronchiolitis during infancy had decreased lung function, more often wheezing episodes, current medication and follow-up for asthma at age seven years than did the age matched controls. They also had lower average birth weight and more often first order family members with asthma. We did not find significant differences between the RSV+ and RSV- groups., CONCLUSION: Children hospitalised for early-life bronchiolitis are susceptible to recurrent wheezing and reduced pulmonary function by seven years compared to age-matched children not hospitalised for early-life bronchiolitis. We propose that prolonged bronchial hyperreactivity could follow early-life RSV negative as well as RSV positive bronchiolitis.

N2  - Several epidemiological studies have reported recurrent wheezing and asthma in children after respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis in infancy. The relationship with allergic sensitization is less clear and recent evidence suggests an interaction between atopy and RSV infection in the development of asthma. Data from a large, population-based, birth-cohort (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children) were used to compare outcomes of children according to whether or not they had been admitted to hospital in the first 12 months with RSV-proven bronchiolitis. Outcomes considered were 12-month prevalence of wheeze at two ages (between 30-42 and 69-81 months), cumulative prevalence of doctor-diagnosed asthma at 91 months and skin prick test defined atopy at 7 yr. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios for outcomes adjusted for potential confounders. A total of 150 infants (1.1% of the cohort) were admitted to hospital within 12 months of birth with RSV bronchiolitis. The prevalence of wheezing was 28.1% in the RSV group and 13.1% in controls at 30-42 months and 22.6% vs. 9.6% at 69-81 months. The cumulative prevalence of asthma was 38.4% in the RSV group and 20.1% in controls at 91 months. Atopy was found in 14.6% of the RSV group and in 20.7% of controls at 7 yr. RSV bronchiolitis was associated with subsequent wheezing between 30-42 (Odds ratio [95% CI] 2.3 [1.3, 3.9]) and 69-81 months (OR 3.5 [1.8, 6.6]) and with the cumulative prevalence of asthma at 91 months (OR 2.5 [1.4, 4.3]) but not with atopy (OR 0.7 [0.2, 1.7]). In a population-based birth cohort, RSV bronchiolitis was associated with subsequent wheezing and asthma but not with the development of atopy by age 7 yr.

N2  - Early catch-up growth and subsequent overweight are suggested to be associated with later cardiovascular diseases and later type II diabetes. However, the impact of early catch-up growth and childhood overweight on the development of asthma has been less studied, particularly in children born with very low birth weight (VLBW). A birth cohort of 74 VLBW children (birth weight  or =1 standard deviation score (SDS) at 6 months of corrected postnatal age. Current overweight was defined by body mass index (BMI) exceeding 21.2 and 21.7 kg/m(2), respectively, for boys and girls at 12 yr of age. Current asthma was diagnosed by a pediatrician, according to asthma ever in combination with a positive response to hypertonic saline bronchial provocation test and/or wheeze at physical examination at 12 yr old. Being overweight at 12 yr of age was associated with an increased risk for current asthma in the VLBW children [crude odds ratio (OR): 5.5, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.3-22.2]. After adjustment for early weight gain and neonatal risk, the OR of overweight increased nearly three times (adjusted OR: 15.3, 95% CI: 2.5-90.6). Early rapid weight gain seemed to be inversely associated with current asthma (adjusted OR: 0.49 for an increase of weight equal to 1 SDS, 95% CI: 0.23-1.02, p = 0.06). In addition, early rapid weight gain was inversely associated with the magnitude of bronchial responsiveness at 12 yr (coefficient -1.15, p < 0.01). There was a strong and positive association between overweight and asthma at 12 yr of age in the VLBW children. This strong association had been reduced by early rapid weight gain, possibly via the reduction of bronchial responsiveness.

N2  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and asthma are common causes for consultation in primary care, but the relationship between the two remains unclear. The aim of our study was to investigate the temporal relationship between first diagnoses of GERD and asthma in general practice., METHODS: We used the UK General Practice Research Database to identify a cohort of patients with a first diagnosis of GERD (n = 5,653) and another cohort of patients with a first diagnosis of asthma (n = 9,712) during 1996, which we compared with age-matched and sex-matched control cohorts drawn from the general population without either diagnosis. We investigated the incidence of a GERD diagnosis among the asthma patients and control subjects, and the incidence of an asthma diagnosis among the GERD patients and control subjects during a mean follow-up period of 3 years. We calculated the relative risk (RR) of these diagnoses using Cox regression analysis and examined the risk associated with medication use using nested case-control analysis., RESULTS: The incidence rates of GERD and asthma among the control cohorts were 4.4 and 3.8 per 1,000 person-years, respectively. During the follow-up period, the RR of an incident asthma diagnosis in patients with a new diagnosis of GERD was 1.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9 to 1.6), while the RR of an incident GERD diagnosis among patients with a new diagnosis of asthma was 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2 to 1.8) after adjustment for age, sex, smoking, prior comorbidity, and number of health-care contacts. This increased risk was mainly seen during the first year of follow-up. The prior use of prescription medications for asthma and GERD had no significant effects on the risk of GERD and asthma diagnosis, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with asthma are at a significantly increased risk of developing GERD, mainly during the first year following diagnosis. A nonsignificant increase in the risk of developing asthma was evident among GERD patients. The relationship between GERD and asthma warrants further investigation.

N2  - RATIONALE: Viremia has been implicated in many viral infections; however, viremia due to rhinovirus (RV; rhinoviremia) has been considered not to occur in normal individuals., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether RV enters the bloodstream and identify the possible risk factors., METHODS: Nasopharyngeal washes (NPWs) of 221 children with respiratory infections were examined for the presence of RV by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Blood from 88 children, whose NPW was RV-positive, and 31 of RV-negative control subjects was subsequently examined for the presence of RV in the blood by semi-nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Rhinoviremia was then correlated with clinical characteristics of the disease., RESULTS: RV was detected in the blood of 10 out of 88 NPW RV-positive cases (11.4%): 7 of 28 children with asthma exacerbations (25.0%), 2 of 26 with common cold (7.7%), 1 of 25 with bronchiolitis (4.0%), and 0 of 9 with pneumonia (0%). All NPW RV-negative cases were negative in the blood. The proportion of rhinoviremia in children with asthma exacerbation was significantly higher compared with children suffering from the other diseases (25 vs. 5%, p = 0.01). Significant risk factors were: sampling <or= 24 hours from symptom initiation, personal history of asthma, and male sex. Age, fever, family, and personal history of atopy did not affect the presence of RV in the blood., CONCLUSIONS: Viremia may occur during RV respiratory infections in normal children and is rather common in the early course of acute asthma exacerbations, suggesting that rhinoviremia may be involved in asthma exacerbation pathogenesis.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There are wide global variations in the prevalence of asthma and wheezing., OBJECTIVES: We examined the associations of place of birth with doctor-diagnosed asthma, wheezing in the past 12 months, and other allergic conditions in Mexican American children., METHODS: The study used data on 4121 Mexican American children age 2 months to 16 years who participated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey., RESULTS: The risk of asthma was associated with being born in the United States after adjusting for sex, age, history of ear infection, and having a regular place for health care (odds ratio, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.09-4.40). Among children with no previous history of ear infection, US-born children were more likely to report wheezing in the past 12 months than their peers born in Mexico after controlling for confounding variables (odds ratio, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.09-3.87). Mexican American children born in the United States were more likely to have positive skin reaction to cat, house mite, Alternaria alternata , peanut, Bermuda grass, and short ragweed but were less likely to have a positive skin test to German cockroaches after adjusting for sex, age, ear infection, having a regular place for health care, and area of residence., CONCLUSION: Our study indicated significant associations of place of birth with respiratory symptoms and allergic conditions in Mexican American children. These findings highlight the need for further studies to examine environmental factors that change by migration and explain the observed differential in the risk of asthma or wheezing.

T1  - Primary prevention of asthma and allergy.
A1  - Arshad, Syed Hasan
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - The relentless increase in the prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases highlights the need for devising effective preventive strategies. Although the genetics of these disorders are being investigated, manipulation of known environmental risk factors remains the best available approach to this problem. However, the large number of potential environmental risk factors and our inability to accurately predict the development of asthma and allergy has led to conflicting data from recent prevention studies. Nonetheless, some useful recommendations can be made. Exclusive breast-feeding and avoidance of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke exposure can be safely recommended for the whole population, not only for prevention of allergy but also for other known benefits. Additionally, for children at high risk of allergy, maternal exclusion diet during lactation and protein hydrolysate as a supplement or alternative for children who could not be breast-fed seems to provide further protection. The preventive effect of avoidance of house dust mite allergen alone during pregnancy or after birth is disappointing. However, prospective randomized studies evaluating a combined food and house dust mite allergen avoidance regimen show some protection against atopic dermatitis in infancy and asthma in later childhood. Urgent research is needed to accurately identify children at high risk and to test novel preventative measures with the potential for immunomodulation. Further randomized controlled trials are also needed with long-term follow up to evaluate combined approaches that might provide maximum benefit.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Allergic reactions to food are well recognized in both children and adults, but because of their relative infrequency their typical features may not be readily recognized by patients and their medical care givers who are not allergists., OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the circumstances and clinical characteristics of food allergies in adults and children in the community., METHODS: Self-completed questionnaire responses over a 6-month period from 109 members of the Anaphylaxis Campaign, the major British patient resource group for people who have suffered severe allergic reactions., RESULTS: One hundred and nine respondents reported 126 reactions during the study period. Seventy-five were children (under 16 years, median age 6 years at the time of reaction). Predictably more boys than girls were reported to have had reactions but more women reported reactions than men (P<0.05). Although the groups were equally aware of their food allergies the children had undergone diagnostic tests more often (P<0.001). Foods were implicated in 112 (89%) of reports. Restaurants were implicated less often (14%) than in other series, probably reflecting British eating habits. Children with asthma reported more severe reactions than those without asthma (P=0.008), although frequency or severity of recent asthma symptoms was not associated with severity of allergic reaction reported. When available, self-injectable adrenaline was used in 35% of severe reactions and 13% of non-severe reactions (P=0.01). A quarter of adults who received one dose of adrenaline also received a second dose., CONCLUSION: The allergens implicated in this report reflect previous data from similar patient groups in North America. Asthmatic children suffer more severe reactions than non-asthmatic children. It appears that British adults need better access to expert care of their allergies. Even when it is prescribed and available self-injectable adrenaline appears under-used in severe reactions. The incidence of severe but non-fatal allergic reactions in the UK may have been underestimated in the past.

N2  - Using multivariate regression analysis, we examined risk factors for fatality and neurological sequelae after status epilepticus (SE) in children. Possible risk factors included sex, age at onset, the cause of SE, pyrexia, asthmatic attack during SE, past history of seizure, predisposing neurological abnormality, seizure duration, type of seizure, and medication with theophylline. Consecutive patients with SE, aged 1 month to 18 years, who were referred to Tottori University Hospital from 1984 to 2002 were reviewed. Of the 234 patients enrolled, 45 patients (19.2 %) showed poor outcomes, namely early death in 9 and neurological sequela in 36. Acute neurological insult and progressive neurological disease as the cause of SE were very significantly related to poor outcome (OR = 33.68, p = 0.000). We excluded 21 patients with the etiology of acute neurological insult and progressive neurological disease and then reanalyzed risk factors in the remaining 213 patients. Twenty-nine patients (13.6 %) showed poor outcome, namely early death in 6 and neurological sequela in 23. Seizure duration of more than 2 hours (OR = 12.73, p = 0.000) and moderate to severe asthmatic attack (OR = 31.61, p = 0.010) were associated with poor outcome. These results indicate that long-lasting seizure activity and asthmatic attack can exacerbate SE-associated brain injury.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of asthma and its correlated factors in Zaozhuang area in 2003, to provide a basic consideration for prevention/treatment and control policy., METHODS: 6 points were selected by stratified-clusterd-random sampling with a total of 16,725 persons expected, but only 10,610 subjects investigated., RESULTS: In this survey, 128 asthma cases were identified with a overall prevalence of 1.21%. The prevalence for children was 2.02%, and for adult was 0.90% with the former significantly higher then the latter (chi(2) = 21.39, P < 0.01). Rates for male and female were 1.08%, 1.32% with a ratio of 1:1.22. For 77.97% of children with asthma. The initiative age of asthma was before 7 years old among children while among 36.23% of the adults, it was before 15 years of age. Correlation analysis showed that upper respiratory tract infection (OR = 17.81, 95% CI: 12.25-25.89), cold air exposure (OR = 3.43, 95% CI: 2.41-4.90), stimulation through cooking and by harmful gases (OR = 2.56, 95% CI: 1.80-3.63), allergic materials (OR = 2.74, 95% CI: 1.80-4.17) were main inducing factors. 65.63% of the asthma cases having had history of allergic disease while 25.78% having had family history with the OR of allergic history and family history as 21.69 vs. 73.96., CONCLUSION: The epidemic status of bronchial asthma was serious, with an assumption that asthma cases might have reached the number of 43 thousand in Zaozhuang area.

T1  - Asthma in the pediatric sickle cell patient with acute chest syndrome.
A1  - Bryant, Rosalind
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - INTRODUCTION: Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a potential life-threatening complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). The purpose of this study was to identify the frequency of asthma in children with SCD who were diagnosed with ACS. The objective was to determine if an increased frequency of asthma exists in children with SCD and ACS., METHOD: A retrospective descriptive chart review covering the period from June 1997 to June 2002 was conducted on 60 children ranging in age from 1.5 years to 17 years who had SCD and ACS. Cross-tabs analysis and student t tests were used to determine the significance of the occurrence of asthma in children in whom ACS developed., RESULTS: Of the 60 eligible children with SCD, 53% (32/60) had asthma and/or abnormal pulmonary function tests prior to the development of ACS., DISCUSSION: This is the first study to report a slight increase in the frequency of asthma prior to the initial ACS in children with SCD. The small convenience sample size from one center may have been a limitation in this study to detect significant differences between the variables.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The variety of toxocariasis clinic manifestations and its relationship with asthma motivated this study. The aim was to study T.canis seropositivity at a public pediatric service and its association with laboratory, epidemiological and clinical factors., METHODS: This study was cross-sectional and controlled. Two hundred and eight children, from 1 to 14 years old and treated at the University of Santo Amaro Pediatric Department s Immunology and Pneumology clinic between January 2000 and January 2001, underwent serology testing. Antibodies were detected by ELISA testing for the larval excretory-secretory antigen of T. canis. We used the chi-square test for T.canis seropositivity (titers > or = 1:320) associations with: puppies at home, contact with soil, geophagia, onicophagia, mother's educational level, asthma, chronic cough, repetitive pneumonia, skin manifestations, rhinitis, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, abdominal pain, anemia, eosinophilia, immunoglobulins, parasitosis and stunted growth. The Kruskal-Wallis variance analysis method was used for mean comparisons between seropositive and seronegative groups. Significance was set at p < or = 0.05., RESULTS: Seroprevalence was 54.8%, with a mean age of 6.5 years while for seronegative children the mean age was 5.8 years, showing no significant difference. There was also no difference between sexes. Seropositivity was significantly associated with puppies at home, contact with soil, hepatomegaly, asthma, eosinophilia, increased serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E levels and stunted growth., CONCLUSION: Seroprevalence was elevated in this study . T.canis infection must be considered in at-risk children, such as those with puppies at home, who have had contact with soil, who have hepatomegaly and/or asthma with eosinophilia and increased serum IgE.

N2  - The article is dedicated to the topical problem of allergic diseases in various population groups of a large industrial region of Moscow suburb, and presents a brief review of present-day epidemiological data on allergic pathology prevalence as well as authors' own data on the morbidity of bronchial asthma, allergic dermatoses, and allergic rhinitis. The paper also contains the results of an analysis of allergic pathology dynamics within 5 to 10 years, and a retrospective analysis of allergic pathology structure in adolescents. The researchers undertook a multifactor analysis of population habitat in the town Mitishchy, based upon ecological and hygienic data concerning atmospheric air and water composition. The study points to the role played by industrial environment in the appearance of allergic skin diseases. Complex measures on allergic disease prevention are considered, and an effective pathogenically grounded method of ozonotherapy is suggested as one of prospective non-drug means of treatment.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Past studies of the prevalence of childhood asthma have yielded conflicting findings as to whether racial/ethnic disparities remain after other factors, such as income, are taken into account. The objective of this study was to examine the association of race/ethnicity and family income with the prevalence of childhood asthma and to assess whether racial/ethnic disparities vary by income strata., METHODS: Cross-sectional data on 14,244 children aged <18 years old in the 1997 National Health Interview Survey were examined. The authors used logistic regression to analyze the independent and joint effects of race/ethnicity and income-to-federal poverty level (FPL) ratio, adjusting for demographic covariates. The main outcome measure was parental report of the child having ever been diagnosed with asthma., RESULTS: Bivariate analyses, based on weighted percentages, revealed that asthma was more prevalent among non-Hispanic black children (13.6%) than among non-Hispanic white children (11.2%; p<0.01), but the prevalence of asthma did not differ significantly between Hispanic children (10.1%) and non-Hispanic white children (11.2%; p=0.13). Overall, non-Hispanic black children were at higher risk for asthma than non-Hispanic white children (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03, 1.40), after adjustment for sociodemographic variables, including the ratio of annual family income to the FPL. Asthma prevalence did not differ between Hispanic children and non-Hispanic white children in adjusted analyses (adjusted OR=0.85; 95% CI 0.71, 1.02). Analyses stratified by income revealed that only among children from families with incomes less than half the FPL did non-Hispanic black children have a higher risk of asthma than non-Hispanic white children (adjusted OR=1.99; 95% CI 1.09, 3.64). No black vs. white differences existed at other income levels. Subsequent analyses of these very poor children that took into account additional potentially explanatory variables did not attenuate the higher asthma risk for very poor non-Hispanic black children relative to very poor non-Hispanic white children., CONCLUSIONS: Non-Hispanic black children were at substantially higher risk of asthma than non-Hispanic white children only among the very poor. The concentration of racial/ethnic differences only among the very poor suggests that patterns of social and environmental exposures must overshadow any hypothetical genetic risk.

N2  - In 155 asthmatic children we have studied the relationship between prick test positivity and a set of genetic factors previously found to be associated with bronchial asthma. Among these factors, MN system (p = 0.009) and age at onset of symptoms (p = 0.05) are the most important variables separating prick test negative from prick test positive children. MN and age at onset influence independently prick test positivity pointing to an additive effect of the two variables. M phenotype appears correlated positively with an increased susceptibility to nonallergic asthma in all age groups, whereas N phenotype appears correlated positively with age at onset but in allergic asthma only. The MN system codifies for glycophorin A, a sialoglycoprotein that represents a major ligand for several bacteria and viruses that recognize the N-acetylneuraminic acid present in this protein. The present data suggest that genetic variability in this system might influence bacterial and viral competition and mucosal damage influencing susceptibility to asthmatic reactions in absence of IgE hyperproduction.

N2  - A child with atopy produces IgE antibodies after exposure to common environmental allergens. The atopic diseases (eczema, asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis) are clinical syndromes each defined by a group of symptoms and signs. Not all children with atopy will have atopic disease or develop symptoms after exposure to an allergen. Both genetic and environmental factors determine the development of atopic disease. The presence of specific IgE antibodies to environmental allergens is determined with skin prick or radioallergosorbent testing in children with atopy. Test results should be interpreted in the context of the clinical history and further investigations (eg, allergen avoidance or challenge). Management of atopic disease is frequently symptomatic, but it is important to avoid identified allergen triggers. Immunotherapy may be considered in selected school-age children with severe rhinoconjunctivitis. Preventing atopic disease in high-risk infants and hindering progression of disease in children with established disease are the areas of active research.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cesarean delivery modifies infant gut bacterial flora composition, which may result in hindered tolerance to allergenic substances, thereby increasing the risk of asthma in accordance with the hygiene hypothesis. Results of previous studies regarding an association between birth route and asthma are conflicting, and these studies have not evaluated some potential confounding effects, including prematurity and maternal asthma., OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cesarean delivery in full-term and premature infants increases the risk of subsequent childhood asthma hospitalization., METHODS: We conducted a case-control study using the Washington State Birth Events Record Database linked to statewide hospitalization data. The study included 2,028 children hospitalized for asthma (cases) and 8,292 age-matched controls., RESULTS: Cesarean delivery was modestly associated with an increased risk of asthma hospitalization (odds ratio [OR], 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.39). However, when analyzed separately, there was an association between cesarean delivery and asthma hospitalization in premature infants (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.09-3.02) but not in full-term infants (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.97-1.34)., CONCLUSIONS: Cesarean delivery was associated with subsequent asthma hospitalization only in premature infants. Because mothers with asthma are reported to have increased rates of cesarean delivery and premature delivery, other factors in addition to the hygiene hypothesis, including genetic and in utero influences associated with maternal asthma, may contribute to the increased risk of asthma in premature infants.

T1  - Population disparities in asthma.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - The prevalence of asthma in the United States is higher than in many other countries in the world. Asthma, the most common chronic disease of childhood in the United States, disproportionately burdens many socioeconomically disadvantaged urban communities. In this review we discuss hypotheses for between-country disparities in asthma prevalence, including differences in "hygiene" (e.g., family size, use of day care, early-life respiratory infection exposures, endotoxin and other farm-related exposures, microbial colonization of the infant bowel, exposure to parasites, and exposure to large domestic animal sources of allergen), diet, traffic pollution, and cigarette smoking. We present data on socioeconomic and ethnic disparities in asthma prevalence and morbidity in the United States and discuss environmental factors contributing to asthma disparities (e.g., housing conditions, indoor environmental exposures including allergens, traffic air pollution, disparities in treatment and access to care, and cigarette smoking). We discuss environmental influences on somatic growth (low birth weight, prematurity, and obesity) and their relevance to asthma disparities. The relevance of the hygiene hypothesis to the U.S. urban situation is reviewed. Finally, we discuss community-level factors contributing to asthma disparities.

N2  - Epidemiologic studies of farm children are of international interest because farm children are less often atopic, have less allergic disease, and often have less asthma than do nonfarm children--findings consistent with the hygiene hypothesis. We studied a cohort of rural Iowa children to determine the association between farm and other environmental risk factors with four asthma outcomes: doctor-diagnosed asthma, doctor-diagnosed asthma/medication for wheeze, current wheeze, and cough with exercise. Doctor-diagnosed asthma prevalence was 12%, but at least one of these four health outcomes was found in more than a third of the cohort. Multivariable models of the four health outcomes found independent associations between male sex (three asthma outcomes), age (three asthma outcomes), a personal history of allergies (four asthma outcomes), family history of allergic disease (two asthma outcomes), premature birth (one asthma outcome), early respiratory infection (three asthma outcomes), high-risk birth (two asthma outcomes), and farm exposure to raising swine and adding antibiotics to feed (two asthma outcomes). The high prevalence of rural childhood asthma and asthma symptoms underscores the need for asthma screening programs and improved asthma diagnosis and treatment. The high prevalence of asthma health outcomes among farm children living on farms that raise swine (44.1%, p = 0.01) and raise swine and add antibiotics to feed (55.8%, p = 0.013), despite lower rates of atopy and personal histories of allergy, suggests the need for awareness and prevention measures and more population-based studies to further assess environmental and genetic determinants of asthma among farm children.

N2  - Increased airway responsiveness (AR) is associated with asthma, but not all individuals with increased AR have asthma. The aim of this study was to identify factors, other than physician-diagnosed asthma (PDA), which are associated with increased AR. In a longitudinal study, data were collected on atopy and lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) in infancy, and AR (expressed as dose-response slope (DRS)), atopy, tobacco-smoke exposure and PDA in childhood. At age 6 yrs, DRS was assessed in 102 children, of whom 22 (22%) had PDA; the corresponding figures at 11 yrs of age were 176 and 29 (15%). At age 6 yrs, DRS was significantly associated with PDA, current atopy and parental smoking (n = 83). At age 11 yrs, DRS was significantly associated with PDA, current atopy and LRTI in the first six months (n = 75). There was a significant positive interaction between atopy at age 12 months and PDA age 11 yrs. In conclusion, these data suggest that factors other than asthma or atopy may determine the level of airway responsiveness in children. In children with asthma, airway responsiveness may be influenced by the early onset of atopy. The current findings may explain the inconsistent relationship between airway responsiveness and asthma.

N2  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: We sought to identify early life factors (ie, first 4 years) associated with wheeze, asthma, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) at age 10 years, comparing their relative influence for these conditions., METHODS: Children were seen at birth, and at 1, 2, 4, and 10 years of age in a whole-population birth cohort study (1,456 subjects). Information was collected prospectively on genetic and environmental risk factors. Skin-prick testing was performed at 4 years of age. Current wheeze (in the last 12 months) and currently diagnosed asthma (CDA) [ie, current wheeze and ever-diagnosed asthmatic subject] were recorded at 10 years of age when BHR was measured at bronchial challenge. Independent significant risk factors for these outcomes were identified by logistic regression., RESULTS: Independent significance for current wheeze occurred with maternal asthma (odds ratio [OR], 2.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27 to 3.41) and paternal asthma (OR, 2.12; 95% CI 1.29 to 3.51), recurrent chest infections at 2 years (OR, 3.98; 95% CI, 2.36 to 6.70), atopy at 4 years of age (OR, 3.69; 95% CI, 2.36 to 5.76), eczema at 4 years of age (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.24 to 3.73), and parental smoking at 4 years of age (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.25 to 3.81). For CDA, significant factors were maternal asthma (OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.24 to 3.73), paternal asthma (OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.17 to 4.52), and sibling asthma (OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.16 to 3.43), recurrent chest infections at 1 year of age (OR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.12 to 6.40) and 2 years of age (OR, 4.11; 95% CI, 2.06 to 8.18), atopy at 4 years of age (OR, 7.22; 95% CI, 4.13 to 12.62), parental smoking at 1 year of age (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.15 to 3.45), and male gender (OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.95). For BHR, atopy at 4 years of age (OR, 5.38; 95% CI, 3.06 to 9.47) and high social class at birth (OR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.16 to 3.53) proved to be significant., CONCLUSIONS: Asthmatic heredity, predisposition to early life atopy, plus early passive smoke exposure and recurrent chest infections are important influences for the occurrence of wheeze and asthma at 10 years of age. BHR at 10 years of age has a narrower risk profile, suggesting that factors influencing wheezing symptom expression may differ from those predisposing the patient to BHR.

T1  - The influence of the living conditions on the diagnostics process and treatment of bronchial asthma of developmental age based on the author's own material.
A1  - Cendrowska-Pinkosz, Monika
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Bronchial asthma is one of the most frequent chronic diseases of developmental age. The occurrence of bronchial asthma with children is connected with individual predisposition to development of atopic disease as well as with the presence of specific environmental conditions. Specific factors include food, inhalatory and contact allergens. Non-specific factors include infections, air pollution, and passive smoking. Environment conditions have the significant influence on the course of the disease. The aim of this work is to estimate the frequency of occurring bronchial asthma with children and the influence of living conditions on the diagnosis and treatment processes. The researches were completed on the group of 43 children aged from 8 months to 14 years. The children attended the Paediatric Counselling and complained about chronic cough or symptoms of wheezing breath. The initial diagnosis included taking a history of a patient and his/her family, physical examinations, and supplementary investigation. The final diagnosis was confirmed after a specialist consultation. After introduction of medical treatment, the follow-up examinations were recommended every 4-6 weeks. In the examined group the children with proper birth weight (89%) who were breast-fed at least for 6 months (78%) predominated. In 23% of cases the living conditions were qualified as inconvenient. 63% of children were in a risk of passive smoking in their place of living. In all age groups the children from the families burdened with atopy dominated (98%). In 44% of cases a pet was present in the place of living. In the examined material the highest percentage of children with diagnosis was observed in groups of children aged 7-10. In this group the boys living in difficult conditions prevailed. A high percentage of young children aged 2-3 years were observed. In this group the girls living in good living conditions prevailed. On the basis of the present experience it has been possible to claim that parents of children aged 4-6 have had the highest consciousness of necessity of urgent diagnosis and medical treatment. Treatment of bronchial asthma was introduced at 98% of cases. In the examined group no essential statistical effectiveness of treatment regarding to sex or the living conditions was found. The presented analysis confirms the role of environmental epidemiology in the setting of true relationship between the diagnosis of asthma and the exposure to specific environmental factors.

N2  - Passive cigarette smoking is an important medical problem; it concerns first of all children as an injurious environmental factor affecting their health. Results of the conducted questionnaire and evaluation of the CO concentration in exhaled air proved the injurious exposure to be the cigarette smoke. The study showed more often allergy, bronchial asthma and respiratory tract infections in the group of children exposed to passive smoking cigarettes at home in comparison with the group of children without this exposure. The study was conducted among 75 families belonging to Model Family Practice so it has also important educational aspects.

T1  - Asthma and depressive and anxiety disorders among young persons in the community.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - BACKGROUND: The objectives of the study were to examine linkages between asthma and depressive and anxiety disorders in a birth cohort of over 1000 young persons studied to the age of 21 years. Specifically, the study aimed to ascertain the extent to which associations between asthma and depressive and anxiety disorders could be explained by non-observed fixed confounding factors., METHOD: Asthma and depressive and anxiety disorders were measured prospectively over the course of a 21-year longitudinal study. Fixed effects logistic regression models were used to determine the relationship between asthma and depressive and anxiety disorders, adjusting for potentially confounding factors., RESULTS: Asthma in adolescence and young adulthood was associated with increased likelihood of major depression (OR 1.7, 95 % CI 1.3-2.3), panic attacks (OR 1.9, 95 % CI 1.3-2.8), and any anxiety disorder (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.2). Associations between asthma and depressive and anxiety disorders were adjusted for confounding factors using a fixed effects regression model which showed that, after control for fixed confounding factors, asthma was no longer significantly related to major depression (OR 1.1), panic attacks (OR 1.1), or any anxiety disorder (OR 1.2). Additional post hoc analyses suggested that exposure to childhood adversity or unexamined familial factors may account for some of the co-morbidity of asthma and depressive and anxiety disorders., CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm and extend previous findings by documenting elevated rates of depressive and anxiety disorders among young adults with asthma, compared with their counterparts without asthma, in the community. The weight of the evidence from this study suggests that associations between asthma and depressive and anxiety symptoms may reflect effects of common factors associated with both asthma and depressive and anxiety disorders, rather than a direct causal link. Future research is needed to identify the specific factors underlying these associations.

N2  - Inhaled administration of glucocorticoid doesn't mean lack of systemic effects of drug. Bioavailability of steroid depends on oral absorption and absorption from respiratory system. In case of fluticasone propionate (FP) swallowed dose can be neglected because almost total (>99%) inactivation in liver during first pass. In second part of paper the most important safety parameters of therapy with FP are discussed, it means; influence on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, growth and bone metabolism. Interpretation of potential side effects should differentiate between abnormal value of laboratory test and clinically important symptoms. Adrenal suppression depends on dose of FP and was found even after low dose (about 200 microg per day), but clinical value of this findings is unknown. Prolonged administration of high doses can suppress hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; exceptionally, it can induce adrenal insufficiency. Recommended doses of FP given 1 to 2 years doesn't cause growth retardation. Long term studies on influence of drug on final height are needed. FP as other inhaled corticosteroids, may transiently alter bone metabolism. Till now there are no evidences that this drug, when prescribed appropriately in standard doses for asthma control, may decrease the bone mineral density or induce osteoporosis and may increase the risk of bone fractures in asthmatic children. Effective asthma control achieved with FP therapy permits normal activity and development of asthmatic children which prevails over exceptionally noticed side effects.

N2  - Atopic disorders (asthma, hay fever, atopic dermatitis) may develop on the basis of a genetic predisposition towards environmental factors. These complex genetic conditions do not follow Mendelian inheritance patterns. Rather, the genetic predisposition for atopic diseases is based on a combination of changes affecting several genes which are involved in a variety of pathophysiological mechanisms. A number of candidate genes for asthma and allergies have already been identified. Today, it seems possible to identify genetic risk profiles related to specific environmental conditions which should lead to an improvement in diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic measures. However, before genetic diagnostic can be implemented in clinical practice, further studies are needed.

N2  - Over and beyond the avoidance of allergies, prophylactic measures can also prevent the development of lower airway disease from upper airway disease, for example, bronchial asthma from allergic rhinitis. A further protective effect can be achieved by reducing both prenatal and postnatal allergens. A major concept of prevention--not merely of pulmonary function changes and the development of allergies--is the avoidance of exposure to passive smoking. With regard to pharmacotherapeutic agents, both official approval for their use by the respective age group, and the dearth of study-based data need to be taken into account. To ensure the successful application of inhalative agents, the use of appropriate inhalation aids as also ensuring the correct inhalation technique are urgently recommended, particularly in the case of children and adolescents.

N2  - There is an increase in the prevalence of atopic disorders such as atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis. Apart from a positive family history, environmental and genetic factors play a major role in their development. The measures of choice for the diagnosis of allergic conditions is the history (personal or as reported by family members, for example). For in vivo testing in children, prick tests are employed. For in vitro diagnosis, determination of total IgE and specific IgE is used. If bronchial asthma is suspected, children older than 5 years, may be submitted to a diagnostic lung function test. Provocative testing is reserved for specific problems.

N2  - Many authors in recent years have proposed extensions of familiar survival analysis methodologies to apply in dependent data settings, for example, when data are clustered or subject to repeated measures. However, these extensions have been considered largely in the context of right censored data. In this paper, we discuss a parametric frailty model for the analysis of clustered and interval censored failure time data. Details are presented for the specific case where the underlying time to event data follow a Weibull distribution. Maximum likelihood estimates will be obtained using commercially available software and the empirical efficiency of these estimators will be explored via a simulation study. We also discuss a score test to make inferences about the magnitude and significance of over-dispersion in clustered data settings. These methods will be illustrated using data from the East Boston Asthma Study. Copyright 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To examine factors that influence the natural history of asthma, such as genetics, atopy, air pollution and environmental tobacco smoke, gastroesophageal reflux, and infection, to promote early identification and treatment of patients at risk for persistent asthma., DATA SOURCES: Journal articles published in English involving human subjects with asthma., STUDY SELECTION: Studies were selected for their relevance to the discussion of asthma and the factors that contribute to its persistence. Epidemiologic studies were favored in assessing the natural history of asthma from childhood to adulthood., RESULTS: Major factors that can influence the severity and persistence of asthma are genetics, atopy, pollution, environmental tobacco smoke, gastroesophageal reflux, and respiratory infections. Epidemiologic studies reveal that factors strongly linked to the persistence of childhood asthma into adult life are early age of disease onset with more severe symptoms, atopy, and level of allergen exposure., CONCLUSIONS: Although there is still much research to be done, epidemiologic studies have repeatedly proven that the natural history of asthma is in some ways predictable. Early identification of patients at risk for persistent asthma, combined with early institution of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic intervention strategies, may lead to better outcomes.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this cohort study was to determine if complications of pregnancy and labor, characteristics at birth, and exposure to infections influence the incidence of asthma in the first 6 years of life., DESIGN: We identified all children born between 1980 and 1990 in the Province of Manitoba, Canada. We used records of physician contacts (inpatient and outpatient) and services of the universal provincial health insurance plan to follow up 170,960 children from birth to the age of 6 years to identify the first diagnosis of asthma. Information on mothers and siblings was also obtained to determine family history of disease and exposure to infections., RESULTS: During the study period, a diagnosis of asthma was made in 14.1% of children by the age of 6 years. The incidence was higher in boys than in girls, in those with family history of allergic diseases. It was higher in urban than in rural areas, and lowest in those born in winter. Asthma was more likely in those with low birth weight and premature birth. Certain congenital abnormalities and complications of pregnancy and labor also increased the risk of asthma. The risk of asthma increased with maternal age. Both upper and lower respiratory infections increased the risk of subsequent asthma, and this effect was more important than exposure to familial respiratory infections, which also tended to increase asthma risk. The risk of asthma decreased with the number of siblings when siblings had a history of allergic disorders., CONCLUSIONS: In addition to genetic influences, intrauterine and labor conditions are determinants of asthma. Exposure to both upper and lower respiratory tract infections increases the risk; these infections do not explain the protective effect associated with the increasing number of siblings.

N2  - BACKGROUND: General practitioners (GPs) have a central place in the management of asthma, particularly in the context of acute exacerbations., AIM: To evaluate the management of asthma exacerbations by GPs, and to investigate the ability of risk factors for near fatal asthma to predict the severity of asthma attacks in the community., DESIGN OF STUDY: A 1-month multicentre cross-sectional survey., SETTING: One thousand and ninety-four GPs of the French Sentinel Network were contacted; 365 responded., METHOD: Asthma exacerbations were classified according to severity at presentation. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed by logistic regression to identify those factors associated with severe exacerbations., RESULTS: Exacerbations were described in 219 patients with asthma. Over half (54%) of exacerbations were severe. Peak expiratory flow was recorded during the consultation in 55% of patients who were more than 5 years old. beta(2) agonists were prescribed to 93% of patients, systemic corticosteroids to 71%, and antibiotics to 64%. Only 42% of patients had a written action plan for self-management of exacerbations. Risk factors for near fatal asthma, identified in 26% of patients, were not significantly associated with severe asthma exacerbations. Short duration of exacerbation before consultation (<3 hours) was associated with an increase in relative risk of severe exacerbation of 3.38, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) = 1.19 to 9.61, compared with duration of >3 hours., CONCLUSION: Risk factors for near fatal asthma identified in previous studies were not predictive of a severe exacerbation in general practice, with the exception of short duration of exacerbation before consultation. This suggests that new methods to predict risk in the outpatient settings should be developed.

T1  - Pharmacologic therapy for the treatment of asthma in children.
A1  - Waikart, L

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Asthma in children results in a large negative global impact and its recent increase in prevalence demands an aggressive and comprehensive treatment program. Recently there has been increasing global cooperation for developing more standardized treatment plans to address this complex disease. Advances in our knowledge of the exact mechanisms of this disease continue to lead to better pharmacologic treatment options. A variety of medications are currently available for the treatment of both acute and chronic asthma symptoms. The importance of controller medications that affect the underlying inflammatory process has been emphasized in the most recent treatment recommendations. The initial choice of medications for asthma treatment is frequently based on the severity classification of the asthma symptoms. Severity classifications include mild intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, and severe persistent. Guidelines for treatment options for each of these severity classifications are available which incorporate appropriate flexibility for such a dynamic disease. These guidelines are based on evidence of effectiveness, relative safety, and other factors. This article reviews many of these medications, their actions, side effects, relative efficacy, and their indications for pediatric asthma treatment.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the relationship between emergency visits for acute respiratory illnesses, acute bronchial asthma crisis (ABAC) and acute respiratory infections (ARI), in children less than 14 years of age, and the daily changes of air pollutant levels, in two central hospitals of Havana City, between October 1st 1996 and March 16 1998., MATERIAL AND METHODS: An ecological time series study was conducted. We assessed the relationship between the presence of acute respiratory illnesses, ABAC, and IRA, and exposure to levels of particles less than 10 microg/m3 (PM10), smoke, and sulfur dioxide (SO2); negative binomial regression models were used to assess latency periods of one to five days as well as the cumulative effect of seven days before the emergency visit., RESULTS: The levels of atmospheric pollutants were low, in general. The 24-hour mean values for PM10 levels, smoke, and SO2, were 59.2 microg/m3 (SD=29.2), 27.7 microg/m3 (SD=21.2), and 21.1 microg/m3 (SD=20.1), respectively. An increase of 20 microg/m3 in the daily average of black smoke was associated with a 2.2% increase (95% CI 0.9-3.6) in the number of emergency visits for ABAC. A 20 microg/m3 increase in the daily average of black smoke and SO was associated with an increase in ARI of 2.4% (95% CI 1.2-3.6), and 5% (95% CI 1.3-5.3), respectively, with a 5-day lag. We also observed a cumulative effect for all the contaminants studied., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that air pollution levels in Havana City affect children's respiratory health; therefore implementation of control measures is necessary, especially those aimed at decreasing motor vehicle exhaust fumes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The "hygiene hypothesis" postulates that infections during infancy may protect against asthma and atopy. There is also some evidence that antibiotic and/or paracetamol use may increase the risk of asthma., METHODS: The study measured the association between infections, and medication use early in life and the risk of asthma at age 6-7 years. It involved 1584 children who had been notified to public health services with serious infections at age 0-4 years, and 2539 children sampled from the general population. For both groups, postal questionnaires were completed by parents., RESULTS: There was little difference in the prevalence of current wheezing between the childhood infections group (prevalence = 23.5%) and the general population group (prevalence = 24.3%). There was also little difference whether the major site of infection was gastrointestinal (prevalence = 24.1%), invasive (prevalence = 24.6%) or respiratory (prevalence = 21.1%). However, in both groups, there were associations with antibiotic (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.49 to 2.14) or paracetamol (OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.83) use in the first year of life or recent paracetamol use (OR = 2.10, 95% CI 1.78 to 2.49) and current wheezing. There was a weak protective effect of childhood infections in children who had not used antibiotics in the first year of life (OR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.10)., CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with other evidence that antibiotic use early in life may increase the risk of asthma. They are also consistent with some preliminary evidence associating paracetamol use with an increased risk of asthma. Any protective effect of notifiable childhood infections was weak.

N2  - Asthma is the most frequent chronic disease in childhood with rising prevalance worldwide. Early antiinflammatory therapy can prevent irreversible damage to the lung. Effective drugs such as nedrocromil, DNCG, leukotrienes antagonists or inhaled corticosteroids are available and recommended. But they are not used as assigned. Guidelines may help to find the right medication but they have to be adapted to the individual and his situation.

N2  - There is still a lack of knowledge in the field of aerosol therapy in children, particularly in young children. The amount of drug delivered from a commercially available inhalation device that reaches the lungs of children is generally low. The choice of an optimal combination of delivery device and drug formulation based on individual patient related factors is crucial. Aerosols with a small MMAD and a narrow GSD are required for a sufficient inhalation therapy in early childhood. The development of combinations of delivery devices and drug formulations fulfilling the requirements for an efficient inhalation therapy in young children is likely to increase the therapeutical options in this age group.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There is a lack of clinical evidence that annual vaccination against influenza prevents asthma exacerbations in children., METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 800 children with asthma, where one half did, and the other half did not receive the influenza vaccine. The two groups were compared with respect to clinic visits, emergency department (ED) visits, and hospitalisations for asthma. In multivariable analyses, adjustment was made for baseline asthma severity, prior utilisation of health services, receipt of vaccine in the previous year, and demographic variables., RESULTS: After adjusting for other variables, the vaccine group had a significantly increased risk of asthma related clinic visits and ED visits (odds ratios 3.4 and 1.9, respectively)., CONCLUSION: This study failed to provide evidence that the influenza vaccine prevents paediatric asthma exacerbations.

N2  - To date, few evaluations have examined issues specific to children's asthma management in their homes. This study examined the characteristics, risk factors, and needs of children with asthma, and the impact of home health nurses on improving parents'/family caregivers' knowledge about asthma triggers and management. The medical records of children, </=19 years, residing in New York City, who were admitted to home care with asthma in 1999 (n = 1,007) were reviewed retrospectively to collect a wide range of data. The majority of children with asthma in home care were </=5 years, male, racial/ethnic minorities, and hospital referred. Approximately one in four children with asthma suffered from additional comorbidities. Home environmental triggers included dust/dust mites, animal dander, mold, perfumes/detergents, and cigarette smoke. Notable psychosocial triggers were family tensions, physical activity, anxiety/stress, and friends/peer pressure. Most parents/family caregivers had inadequate knowledge about recognition of asthma attacks and its triggers and management. Discharge assessments suggested that home health nurses can help improve caregivers' knowledge about asthma management. Children with asthma in home care have diverse needs, receive few nurse home visits, and have parents/family caregivers in need of more intensive education on asthma symptom recognition and management.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Dust mite allergen exposure is considered a major determinant of sensitization to these allergens during childhood and a risk factor for pediatric asthma., OBJECTIVE: By using a birth cohort in a setting with a substantial burden of dust mite allergen, we evaluated exposure and risk for outcomes related to allergy and asthma., METHODS: We collected dust from the bedrooms of 428 children born from 1987 to 1989 and measured Der f 1 and Der p 1 (microg/g dust, combined). Follow-up at 6 to 7 years of age included clinical examination, skin prick testing, specific serum IgE measurement, and methacholine challenge., RESULTS: No overall association was evident for any outcome except bronchial hyperresponsiveness (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.38-1.00; P <.050; and OR, 0.53; CI, 0.27-1.04; P <.065 for dust mite allergen levels > or =2 microg/g and >10 microg/g, respectively). With a parental history of allergy and asthma, there was an association between a positive dust mite skin test (OR, 2.09; CI, 0.93-4.73; P <.076) and dust mite allergen level >10 microg/g. The inverse was true for children without a parental history. Dust mite exposure of >10 microg/g was associated with a decreased risk of current atopic asthma among children with a parental history (OR, 0.39; CI, 0.05-3.13; P <.376), but with increased risk if without a parental history (OR, 1.52; CI, 0.22-10.6; P <.673)., CONCLUSION: Parental history is an important independent variable in the relationship between early dust mite exposure and atopic outcomes. Increased exposure during infancy is associated with a higher risk for sensitization in the presence of a positive parental history, but is protective among children of parents without a history of atopic disease.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose was to identify clinical presentation leading to admission to PICU of children affected by influenza, to describe predisposing factors and outcome and to propose preventive measures., METHODS: Ten years (1989-1999) retrospective study carried out in the ten beds PICU. Every child in PICU with an influenza positive culture was enrolled., RESULTS: Twenty four cases collected, aged two weeks-15 years (m =43 months), 19 males. Acute respiratory failure (16/24 =67%) was the first manifestation: pneumonia (13), bronchiolitis (2), status asthmaticus (1). Eleven children had underlying diseases including five immunocompromized. Thirteen patients required mechanical ventilation (mean duration: 22 days), seven developed ARDS (4 immunocompromized) and three died. Central nervous system was the second system affected (8 cases). Four exhibited a chronical cerebral disease and five presented afebrile status epilepticus which required i.v. barbiturates and mechanical ventilation (mean duration: 22 hours). One presented encephalitis, one an apparent life-threatening event, both had a favorable outcome. One child exhibited severe hyperpyrexia and died from multiorgan failure., CONCLUSION: Severe forms of influenza are rare in children but may lead to life-threatening conditions and death(16.5%). Most occur in children with underlying disease, particularly immunocompromized who may exhibit ARDS.

N2  - Outcomes of emergency room treatment of children with asthma have not been well-documented. The purpose of this study was to describe the short-term clinical course of children aged 0-14 years after standard treatment for an acute asthma exacerbation in a pediatric emergency department, and to determine factors associated with follow-up morbidity. This was a prospective cohort study of a randomly selected sample of children with asthma who required treatment for an acute asthma exacerbation during the year 2002. A clinical chart was filled out by the attending pediatrician during the emergency department visit. Participants were interviewed by telephone at 7 and 15 days after the pediatric emergency visit. The study population included 258 children; 125 of them (48.4%) were <2 years old. Eighty-nine percent of children reported a visit with his/her primary asthma care provider during the first week after discharge from the emergency department. A total of 185 children missed 1 or more days of school, with a mean of 3.1 +/- 2.7 days (range, 1-23 days). Twenty-nine patients (11%) returned for medical care at the emergency department, 22 (8.5%) of them during the first week after discharge, and 4 (1.6%) required hospitalization. At the first follow-up control (day 7), 111 patients (43%) reported persistent symptoms and/or difficult breathing, and 157 (61%) were still using asthma medication. At the second follow-up control (day 15), 53 patients (20.5%) reported persistent respiratory symptoms, and 69 (26.7%) used asthma medication. In children >2 years of age, the percentage of patients with respiratory symptoms on day 7 was significantly lower among those who reported maintenance therapy with inhaled steroids (23.7% vs. 46%, P = 0.006). On day 7, asthma symptoms were more frequent in children <2 years of age compared to older children showed a higher percentage of asthma symptoms (50% vs. 36%, P = 0.014). Children <2 years old compared to older children also missed more days school or day nursery (4.48 +/- 4.62 days vs. 2.4 +/- 2.19 days). The short-term outcome of asthma children attended at the emergency department is worse than expected, according to rates of rehospitalization and return for medical care after discharge. Maintenance treatment with inhaled steroids favored a prompt recovery in children older than 2 years of age, whereas the short-term outcome of children aged <2 years was not influenced by any variable.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is considered to be one of the first manifestations in the atopic march. However, few prospective studies on AD and its association with childhood asthma exist., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to prospectively investigate the natural course of AD to determine factors influencing its prognosis and to analyze the relationship of AD with childhood asthma., METHODS: The Multicenter Allergy Study, a German birth cohort, followed 1314 children from birth to age 7 years. Physical examinations, parental interviews on atopic symptoms and diagnoses, and determination of specific IgE levels were performed regularly., RESULTS: The cumulative prevalence of AD in the first 2 years of life was 21.5%. Of these children with early AD, 43.2% were in complete remission by age 3 years, 38.3% had an intermittent pattern of disease, and 18.7% had symptoms of AD every year. Severity (adjusted cumulative odds ratio, 5.86; 95% CI, 3.04-11.29) and atopic sensitization (adjusted cumulative odds ratio, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.29-5.91) were major determinants of prognosis. Early wheeze and a specific sensitization pattern were significant predictors for wheezing at school age, irrespective of AD. Early AD without these cofactors constituted no increased risk of subsequent wheeze (adjusted odds ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.56-2.20) or bronchial hyperreactivity., CONCLUSION: AD is a common condition in infancy but disappears around age 3 years in a significant proportion of children. The prognosis is mostly determined by the severity and the presence of atopic sensitization. Early AD is associated with asthma at school age, but in many of these asthmatic children, wheezing manifests before or with the onset of AD. Children with AD and wheeze have a marked loss in lung function, suggesting a distinct phenotype rather than a progressive development from AD to asthma.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the effects of early environmental and congenital factors on the natural history of asthma may provide important clues to the pathogenesis of asthma., OBJECTIVE: We assessed associations between potential, early determinants and the incidence and remission of asthma throughout life, and tested whether the strength and direction of these associations varied in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood., METHODS: The data pertaining to the individual asthma history of 18,156 subjects, age 0 to 44 years, who attended the clinical stage of the European Community Respiratory Health Survey were analyzed retrospectively by life-event methods. Onset of asthma was defined as age at the first attack, and asthmatic patients were considered to be in remission if they had not been under treatment or had an attack of asthma in the past 24 months. Onset and remission were evaluated in 3 time windows: <10, 10 to 20, and > or =20 years of age. The associations of asthma with early determinants were estimated by hazard ratios (HRs)., RESULTS: A family history of asthma or allergy was associated with a higher risk of developing asthma (HR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.67-2.13) and a lower chance of remission (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64-0.99) throughout life. No matter what one's genetic predisposition was, early, acute respiratory infections were associated with an increased lifelong risk of asthma onset (pooled HR, 3.19; 95% CI, 2.75-3.69), whereas early contact with older children, which is a marker of prolonged, intermittent exposure to infectious agents, conferred permanent protection against asthma (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74-0.96) and increased the chance of remission in childhood asthma (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.10-2.04). Pet ownership had a protective effect only in childhood (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.74-0.96), whereas maternal smoking did not show a significant association with asthma. Female sex was negatively associated with the onset of asthma in childhood (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.52-0.75) and positively in adulthood (HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.61-2.51). The pattern of associations was similar in sensitized (positive assay to specific IgE) and nonsensitized asthmatic patients., CONCLUSION: Genetic predisposition and exposure to infectious agents are major early determinants that influence a subsequent history of asthma. The length and type of exposure to infectious agents seem able either to promote or to suppress an anti-inflammatory process, unrelated to IgE, which can partially interfere with an acquired predisposition for asthma.

T1  - Prevention of allergic disease in childhood: clinical and epidemiological aspects of primary and secondary allergy prevention.
A1  - Halken, Susanne
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - The development and phenotypic expression of atopic diseases depends on a complex interaction between genetic factors, environmental exposure to allergens,and non-specific adjuvant factors, such as tobacco smoke, air pollution and infections. Preventive measures may include both exposure to allergens and adjuvant risk/protective factors and pharmacological treatment. These measures may address the general population, children at risk for development of atopic disease (high-risk infants), children with early symptoms of allergic disease or children with chronic disease. The objective for this review was to evaluate possible preventive measures as regards prevention of development of allergic disease in childhood--primary prevention--and also some aspects of the effect of specific allergy treatment as regards secondary prevention in children with allergic asthma and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. In one prospective observational study of a birth cohort of unselected infants we evaluated possible predictive/risk factors. In two prospective intervention studies including 1 yr birth cohorts of high-risk(HR) infants we investigated the effect of feeding HR infants exclusively breast milk (BM) and/or hydrolyzed cow's milk-based formula the first 4-6 months as regards: (i) the allergy preventive effect of BM/extensively hydrolysed formula (eHF) compared with ordinary cow's milk-based formula, (ii) the effect of two different eHFs, a whey (Profylac) and a casein-based (Nutramigen) formula, as regards development of cow's milk protein allergy (CMA), and (iii) a comparison of the preventive effect of eHF (Profylac/Nutramigen) with a partially hydrolyzed cow's milk-based formula (pHF) (NanHA) as regards development of CMA. None of the mothers had a restricted diet during pregnancy or lactation period. In two prospective randomized intervention studies we evaluated the preventive effect of specific allergen avoidance and specific immunotherapy (SIT) in children with allergic asthma and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, respectively. The combination of atopic heredity and elevated cord blood IgE resulted in the best predictive discrimination as regards development of allergic disease. The optimal high-risk group was defined by either double parental atopic predisposition or single atopic predisposition, the latter combined with a cord blood IgE > or = 0.3 kU/1. 66% of unselected infants were daily exposed to tobacco smoke, which was a significant risk factor for recurrent wheezing until the age of 1.5 yr. HR infants were breastfed for a longer period and less exposed to tobacco smoke than unselected infants. Exclusively BM/eHF for at least 4 months was associated with a significantly reduced cumulative prevalence of CMA [3.6% (5/141) vs. 20%(15/75) in the control group] up to 5 yr. The effect of the two different eHFs was similar. Exclusively breastfed infants were significantly less exposed to tobacco smoke and pets, had solid foods introduced later and belonged to higher social classes. pHF was significantly (p = 0.05) less effective than eHF as regards prevention of development of CMA. A diet period of 4 months seems to be as efficient as 6 months or more as regards development of CMA. A few ongoing prospective, randomized intervention studies have produced the first indication that avoidance of indoor allergens such as house dust mite (HDM) in HR infants may reduce the incidence of severe wheeze and sensitization during the first 1-4 yr of age. Long-term follow-up is awaited. In a prospective, double-blind placebo-controlled study in children with doctors diagnosed asthma and documented HDM allergy, we found that semipermeable polyurethane mattress and pillow encasings (Allergy Control) when compared with placebo encasings resulted in a significant perennial reduction of HDM exposure and a significant reduction in the needed dose of inhaled steroids by approximately 50% (mean dose: 408 microg--227 microg/day) after 1-yr follow-up. In another randomized prospective study we investigated the possible preventive effect of SIT in children with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and grass/birch pollen allergy as regards development of asthma. Among those without asthma significantly fewer in the SIT group developed asthma when compared with the control group (19/79 = 24% vs.32/72 = 44%) after the first 3 yr; and methacholinebronchial provocation test results improved significant in the SIT group. The results of our studies support the evidence that the risk for development of early allergic manifestations e.g. CMA and atopic dermatitis can be reduced significantly by simple dietary measures for the first4 months of life. In all infants breastfeeding should beencouraged for at least 4-6 months, and exposure to tobacco smoke should be avoided during pregnancy and early childhood. In HR infants a documented hypoallergenic formula (at present eHF) is recommended if exclusive breastfeeding is not possible for the first 4 months. In homes of HR-infants, current evidence supports measures to reduce the levels of indoor allergens. e.g. HDM and pets. In symptomatic children allergen-specific treatment may influence both the symptoms and the prognosis. Allergen avoidance can reduce the need for pharmacological treatment, SIT may have the potential for preventing the development of asthma in children with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. and it may be possible to interfere with the natural course of allergic diseases.

N2  - The prevalence of respiratory symptoms related to asthma in children from Latin America has been largely ignored. This region participated in phases I and III of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) with 17 participating centers in phase I and 78 centers in phase III. Data were obtained on asthma, rhinitis and eczema from countries and centers with markedly different climactic, cultural and environmental conditions and socioeconomic development. The results for phase I are presented herein because data from phase III are currently being revised at the ISAAC international data control center and will be officially available in the second half of 2004. Phase I provided important information on the prevalence of asthma in the participating countries and demonstrated wide variation among centers in the same country and among countries. The participating Latin American countries are all developing countries and share more or less the same problems related to low socioeconomic status. Therefore, the results and figures should be analyzed within that context. The range for accumulative and current asthma symptoms in children from the Latin American countries that participated in phase I (89,000) were as follows: the prevalence of asthma ranged from 5.5% to 28% in children aged 13-14 years and from 4.1% to 26.9% in children aged 6-7 years. The prevalence of wheezing in the previous 12 months ranged from 6.6% to 27% in children aged 13-14 years and from 8.6% to 32.1% in children aged 6-7 years. The high figures for asthma in a region with a high level of gastrointestinal parasites infestation, a high burden of acute respiratory and gastrointestinal infections occurring early in life, severe environmental and hygiene problems, suggest that these factors, considered as protective in other (developed) regions of the world, do not have the same effect in this region. Furthermore, those aggressive environmental conditions acting together from very early in life might condition different asthmatic phenotypes with more severe clinical presentation in infancy (first 2 years of life), lower atopy and enhanced airways reactivity. The present study indicates that the prevalence of asthma and related symptoms in Latin America is as high and variable as described previously for industrialized or developed regions of the world and that the environmental risk factors, mainly related with poverty, could be responsible for the different clinical and functional presentations of asthma in children from developing regions.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Asthma attack shows strong seasonality. The purpose of the present study was to quantify the contribution of climate variables and other seasonal factors on the incidence of emergency visits for childhood asthma in Tokyo, Japan., METHODS: The number of children who visited emergency rooms at Jikei university hospitals in Tokyo during 1998-2002 (5559 visits) was retrieved retrospectively from files from the Department of Pediatrics, and compared with 45 climate parameters from the Meteorological Agency using multiple regression models with a stepwise backward elimination approach., RESULTS: The number of visits (3.7 +/- 3.1) per night increased significantly when climate conditions showed a rapid decrease from higher barometric pressure, from higher air temperature and from higher humidity, as well as lower wind speed. The best-fit model demonstrated that a 22% variation in the number of visits was explained by a linear relationship with 12 climate variables, which increased to 36% after adjusting for calendar month and day of the week. Moreover, when the number of asthma visits was cut off at nine per night, the area under the receiver operator characteristics curve was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.89-0.94) in the multiple logistic regression model using the same variables., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that these models might quantify contributions of specific climate conditions and other seasonal factors on the number of emergency visits per night for childhood asthma attack in Tokyo, Japan.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Risk factors for acute wheezing among children in subtropical areas are largely unknown., OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of viral infections, allergen sensitization, and exposure to indoor allergens as risk factors for acute wheezing in children 0 to 12 years old., METHODS: One hundred thirty-two children 0 to 12 years of age who sought emergency department care for wheezing and 65 children with no history of wheezing were enrolled in this case-control study. Detection of respiratory syncytial virus antigen, rhinovirus and coronavirus RNA, adenovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza antigens was performed in nasal washes. Total IgE and specific IgE to mites, cockroach, cat, and dog were measured with the CAP system. Major allergens from mites, cockroach, cat, and dog were quantified in dust samples by ELISA. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed by logistic regression., RESULTS: In children under 2 years of age, infection with respiratory viruses and family history of allergy were independently associated with wheezing (odds ratio, 15.5 and 4.2; P = .0001 and P = .008, respectively). Among children 2 to 12 years old, sensitization to inhalant allergens was the major risk factor for wheezing (odds ratio, 2.7; P = .03). High-level allergen exposure, exposure to tobacco smoke, and lack of breast-feeding showed no association with wheezing., CONCLUSIONS: Some risk factors for wheezing previously identified in temperate climates were present in a subtropical area, including respiratory syncytial virus infection in infants and allergy in children older than 2 years. Rhinovirus was not associated with wheezing and did not appear to be a trigger for asthma exacerbations.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have looked at risk factors for asthma in African children. We aimed to identify the risk factors associated with childhood asthma in Maputo (Mozambique)., METHODS: This case-control study included 199 age-matched children (100 asthmatic and 99 nonasthmatic) who attended Maputo Central Hospital between January 1999 and July 2000. We collected information concerning their familial history of atopy, birth weight, environment and breast-feeding. Detailed information about morbidity and treatment was obtained for each asthmatic child., RESULTS: The children were aged between 18 months and 8 years; 60% were male. The asthmatic children were hospitalized more frequently than the nonasthmatic children (P < 0.0001). Most of the asthmatic children lived in the urban area of Maputo [odd ratio (OR) = 6.73, CI = 3.1-14.0, P < 0.0001], had a parental history of asthma (OR = 26.8, CI = 10.8-68.2, P < 0.0001) or rhinitis (OR = 4, CI = 1.2-13.3, P = 0.005), had at least parent who smoked and were weaned earlier than the nonasthmatic children (OR = 2.4, CI = 1.3-4.4, P < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: Childhood asthma was strongly associated with a family history of asthma and rhinitis, the place of residence, having smokers as parents and early weaning from maternal breast milk. These results highlight the need to reassess the management of asthmatic children in Maputo.

N2  - An admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) with asthma is a marker of asthma severity and may be a precursor of asthma death. The aim of this study was to investigate risk factors for acute severe asthma needing an ICU admission. We hypothesized that children admitted to the ICU represent a severe phenotype with identifiable premorbid clinical features. The study was case-control in design. One hundred and forty-one children were studied. Seventy children admitted to the ICU and 71 children admitted to the general medical ward served as cases and controls, respectively. Children were aged between 1-16 years. They underwent skin prick allergy testing, and had a nasopharyngeal aspirate and serology performed to screen for respiratory pathogens. Their parents completed an asthma and allergy symptom questionnaire and the Newcastle Asthma Knowledge Questionnaire (NAKQ). On univariate analysis, an admission to the ICU was more likely in children with 1) "frequent episodic" or "persistent" background asthma; 2) three or more previous admissions for asthma; 3) one or more asthma admissions in the previous 12 months; 4) three or more presentations to the Emergency Department (ED) in the preceding 12 months; 5) three or more positive responses on skin prick allergy testing; 6) an elevated IgE level; 7) oxygen saturation on presentation < or =91%; 8) longer duration of asthma; 9) lower level of maternal education; 10) an admission during autumn; 11) three or more siblings; and 12) being prescribed antibiotics. Risk factors that remained significant on multivariate analysis were three or more presentations to the ED in the preceding 12 months (P=0.003), an elevated IgE level (P=0.01), oxygen saturation on presentation < or =91% (P=0.003), and longer asthma duration (P=0.02). ICU patients took longer to see a doctor and to commence oral steroids. No differences were found between cases and controls in the proportion taking preventer therapy (58% vs. 52%), provided with a written asthma action plan (32% vs. 25%), or in whom spirometry or peak flow was measured (28% vs. 42%). However, rates were low in both groups. Parental asthma knowledge was generally poor. This study identified risk factors for an ICU admission in children with asthma. A potentially preventable risk factor is a history of multiple ED presentations in the past year. Specialist referral of children with multiple ED presentations may improve asthma control and reduce the risk of an ICU admission. Background asthma management remains suboptimal in children needing hospitalization. Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

T1  - Relationship between dietary antioxidants and childhood asthma: more epidemiological studies are needed.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Approximately 15 million Americans including over 5 million children suffer from asthma, the most common chronic disease in childhood. The prevalence of pediatric asthma has risen sharply over the past four decades, with the sharpest increases occurring in children younger than 6 years and in urban, predominantly minority, populations. The reasons for this dramatic increase are not yet clear. Recent epidemiological studies indicate a higher prevalence of dietary antioxidant deficiency among asthmatics patients. However, the results of these studies are inconsistent or even contradictory. Epidemiological studies with robust design and use of novel epidemiological tools are urgently needed to examine the impact of dietary antioxidants on the incidence of asthma in preschool children. An incidence density case-control study which includes non-atopic controls, who are matched for age, gender, race, study center and sampling time to each asthmatic case will offer a robust study design. A validated food frequency questionnaire and an asthma and atopy severity score can be used to interview the parents of the recruited children. Risk set sampling may enable us to explore possible associations between the type and quantity of dietary antioxidants and the development and severity of asthma in such an epidemiological study.

N2  - The relationship between reduced pulmonary function in early life and persistent wheeze (PW) in school-aged children remains uncertain. In this study, VmaxFRC was assessed at 1 month of age, and the presence of wheeze up to 11 years of age was prospectively identified. At 11 years of age, airway responsiveness (AR) to inhaled histamine and atopy were assessed. Recent wheeze at 11 years of age was associated with a reduced mean z score for VmaxFRC at 1 month of age (-0.41 [SD 0.91], n = 31) compared with no recent wheeze (0.04 [SD 1.00], n = 153, p = 0.03). Wheeze between 4 and 6 years that persisted at 11 years (PW) was most prevalent among those with reduced VmaxFRC at 1 month and atopy aged 11 years (p = 0.002) or reduced VmaxFRC and increased AR aged 11 years (p = 0.015). When all factors were considered, reduced VmaxFRC at 1 month (p = 0.03) and increased AR aged 11 years (p < 0.001) were independently associated with PW (n = 17) compared with other outcomes (n = 129). Reduced airway function present in early infancy is associated with PW at 11 years of age, and this relationship is independent of the effect of increased AR and atopy in childhood.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for children at high risk of complications from influenza due to underlying medical conditions, but few children are vaccinated. Vaccination also is encouraged for all children aged 6 to 23 months when feasible. This study describes the prevalence and characteristics of at-risk children nationwide., STUDY DESIGN: A descriptive analysis of the 2000 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) was conducted among children in the United States aged 6 months through 17 years with identified high-risk conditions, and among all children aged 6 to 23 months., RESULTS: Approximately 5.2 to 10.0 million children aged 6 months through 17 years (7.4%-14.2%) had high-risk conditions indicated for influenza vaccination. Asthma accounted for the majority of conditions. An estimated 7.7 million children would be aged 6 to 23 months during influenza season. Most young children and older children at high-risk have access to and frequently utilize healthcare services., CONCLUSIONS: Existing doctor visits are important opportunities for vaccinating children with high-risk conditions, or for those aged 6 to 23 months. Additional efforts are needed to implement and evaluate efficient strategies for annual influenza vaccination of children aged 6 to 23 months and for older children with medical indications.

T1  - Viral respiratory infection and the link to asthma.
A1  - Gern, James E
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Acute wheezing secondary to viral infection is common in children. Whereas many children suffer primarily mild to moderate symptoms, others develop severe coughing and wheezing., METHODS: Review of recent medical literature regarding the correlation between viral illness and increased susceptibility to develop severe respiratory illnesses and subsequent asthma., DISCUSSION: In infants factors that predispose to severe disease and lower respiratory airway effects include small lung size, passive smoke exposure, virus-induced immune responses, severe disease and infection at a young age. Acute asthma symptoms have been correlated with a variety of viral pathogens, most commonly respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis in infancy and rhinovirus in older children. Epidemiologic and biologic factors that influence development of asthma include repeated exposure to infectious disease during early childhood, early exposure to pets, a farming lifestyle, alterations in bacterial flora of the intestine and increased use of antibiotics. Thus the likelihood of asthma is related to the specific pathogen, severity of infection, cumulative number of infections and stage of immunologic development. Progress is also being made in understanding how viruses can adversely affect lung or immune development. In asthmatic children viral infections initiate bronchospasm and airway obstruction. It is hoped that research on virus-induced airway alterations and the host factors that lead to severe clinical illnesses can help clinicians to identify children whose wheezing is an early sign of asthma.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Since the mid-1980s there has been increasing interest in the effects of passive smoking on the health of children. It has been estimated that the total nicotine dose received by children whose parents smoke is equivalent to their actively smoking between 60 and 150 cigarettes per year. This review article considers the evidence for a relationship between passive smoking and disorders such as: prenatal damage to the fetus; poor growth indicators; respiratory illness; atopy and asthma; coronary heart disease; and sudden infant death syndrome. We conclude that paediatricians should not be complacent about the hazards of passive smoking for children and that public health education efforts should be continued.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Inguinal hernias are common and cause problems for the health services. Several factors are thought to influence their development. Patients under 16 years old who had received hernioplasty at National Taiwan University Hospital were enrolled in a study to analyze the correlation between preceding recurrent cough with asthma and later hernia development. Patients aged 5 and 6 years old (when admitted for hernioplasty in 2000) were particularly focused. This entailed further analysis of their birth history, family atopic history, specific allergic diseases (allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, asthma), hernia type (direct or indirect), the onset of chronic cough and asthma. One hundred and sixty three patients (2.66%) from a total hernioplasty population of 6130 were found to have had preceding asthma with recurrent cough before having the hernioplasty intervention. One hundred twenty-five patients were aged 5 to 6 years old, among whom 8 (6.4%) patients were found to have asthma, and 20 (16%) patients were noted to have recurrent sustained cough. All the hernia types were indirect and were received with high suture ligation. In conclusion, the incidence of asthma was not significantly higher in the group of individuals receiving hernioplasty. However, a higher incidence of recurrent sustained cough was noted, which could be a relatively important factor for the hernia development. Further reliable cough measurements would be needed to evaluate the severity of recurrent sustained cough as the potential risk for the hernia development.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - This study addressed whether whole cell pertussis-vaccinated children have a different risk of atopic disorders compared with children who did not receive this vaccination. Data on vaccination status, atopic disorders and child and family characteristics of the children of 700 families were collected in this retrospective study. A minority of these 700 families refused vaccinations for religious reasons. The relation between pertussis-vaccination status and atopic disorders was analysed by means of adjusted logistic regression for repeated measurements in order to account for the correlation between sibship members. The 700 families included 1,961 children. Data on vaccination status and atopic disorders were available for 1,724 children. Vaccinated children had a reduced risk of atopic disorders. Whole cell pertussis vaccination is associated with a lower risk of atopic disorders, though other vaccine components (diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis) or other vaccinations may also be involved.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To prospectively assess sensitization rates and the development of allergic diseases in a follow-up of a randomized controlled pertussis vaccine trial., SETTING: Two-month-old infants were the subject of this double-blind study in 1992 in a collaboration between the Pediatric Clinic and the Primary Care Centers in Linkoping., PATIENTS AND INTERVENTION: Allergic diseases were evaluated in 667 children, who were randomized to 1 of 4 vaccine groups: a 2-component, a 5-component, or a whole cell pertussis vaccine (all of which were administered with the diphtheria and tetanus toxoids vaccine) and the diphtheria and tetanus toxoids vaccine alone. Allergy development was assessed by questionnaires (n = 667) and skin prick tests (n = 538) at the age of 7 years., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Allergic diseases and skin prick test results at the age of 7 years., RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of allergic diseases was 34.9%, and was similar in the 4 groups (33.3%-37.3%, P =.89), even after adjusting for family history, sex, pets, dampness, environmental smoking at home, and other living conditions. Positive skin prick test results were more prevalent, however, after vaccination with the 2-component acellular vaccine (19.4%) than in the other 3 groups (11.1%-13.5%, adjusted for confounding factors, P =.01). Furthermore, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis was more common in children who were initially immunized with the 2-component pertussis vaccine and received a booster dose with an acellular vaccine compared with those who received no booster vaccination (relative risk, 3.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-12.0)., CONCLUSION: Pertussis vaccination in infancy with any of these vaccines was not associated with allergic manifestations at the age of 7 years, apart from a higher prevalence of positive skin prick test results after an experimental 2-component vaccine, which is no longer in use.

N2  - Major air pollution accidents which occurred in the 1950s led to public awareness of the health hazards involved. Since that period, levels of air pollution have decreased, but several studies conducted in North America and Europe indicate that particulate air pollution is linked to increased cardiorespiratory morbidity and mortality. Despite this evidence, several questions were raised concerning the interpretation of the results (threshold effect, harvesting effect and biological plausibility). The aim of this review is to present the link between epidemiological findings and their use in health impact assessment. We review the main causal criteria applied to epidemiology in light of scientific evidence currently available. Some causality criteria are more important than others, but they all support the causal nature of the relationship between air pollution and health, and thus justify the feasibility of health impact assessment calculations. Recent studies on relative risk assessment show that even if the risk linked to worsening air quality is low, public health consequences are high. Such information must be made accessible to policy makers and the population in general so that, together with the public health workers, they can all contribute to improving air quality and health in their communities.

N2  - Many time-series studies have shown positive associations between air pollutants and asthma morbidity. However, few studies have included pollen as a potential confounder when examining this relationship. This study analysed the short-term association between air pollutants (sulphur dioxide (SO2), particles measured with a median aerodynamic diameter of <10 microm (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3)) and asthma emergency room admissions in Madrid, Spain, in 1995-1998, adjusting for four types of pollen with allergenic potential (Olea europaea, Plantago sp., Poaceae and Urticaceae). Data were analysed using autoregressive Poisson regression and generalised additive models (GAM). The strongest associations were observed at 1 day lag for O3, and 3 days lag for the remaining pollutants. Using Poisson regression, a single-pollutant model showed that a 10-microg x m(-3) rise in pollutant level led to relative risks of: 1.039 for PM10; 1.029 for SO2; 1.033 for NO2; and 1.045 for O3. Adjustment for the different types of pollen led to no substantial variation in these associations. In the multipollutant models for cold-season pollutants (including PM10, SO2 and the four types of pollen) and photochemical pollutants (including NO2, O3 and the four types of pollen) the associations for PM10, NO2 and O3 held, but no relationship with SO2 was evident. GAM analysis yielded the same results, both in terms of lags and of quantification of the effect for all pollutants. In conclusion, the usual air pollution levels in Madrid were associated with an increase in asthma emergency room admissions, and this association remained controlling for the presence of ambient pollen.

N2  - This study sought to determine factors influencing the persistence of early life wheezing up to the age of 10 yrs and to create a score identifying those with the highest risk of persistent disease. Children were seen at birth, 1, 2, 4 and 10 yrs in a whole population birth cohort study (n=1,456). Information was collected prospectively on wheeze prevalence and subjects were classified into wheezing phenotypes. Early life genetic and environmental risk factors were recorded and skin-prick testing (SPT) was performed at 4 yrs. Independently significant factors for persisting wheeze were identified at logistic regression and used to create a score for persistence. Wheezing persistence from the first 4 yrs to the age of 10 yrs occurred in 37% of early life wheezers. Independent significance for persistence was associated with asthmatic family history, atopic SPT at 4 yrs and recurrent chest infections at 2 yrs, whilst recurrent nasal symptoms at 1 yr conferred reduced risk. A cumulative risk score using these factors identified wheezing persistence in 83% scoring 4 and transience in 80% scoring 0. Thus, a combination of genetic predisposition, early life atopy and recurrent chest infections favours the persistence of early life wheezing. Risk scores using such knowledge could provide prognostic guidance on the outcome of early wheeze.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To determine if there is seasonal variation in acute asthmatic visits to accident and emergency (A&E) facilities in Trinidad and to identify the climatic variables associated with such visits., DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective census of patients with asthma, defined as those who required emergency bronchodilator nebulization, was taken at two A&E facilities in Trinidad from 1 January 1997 to 31 December 1999. The study included patients aged 64 years and under. Patient demographic data were obtained from the A&E records. Climate variables were taken from the island's sole Meteorological Office. Multiple regression was used to identify climate variables that were independent predictors of A&E asthma visits., RESULTS: There were a total of 45 842 asthma admissions to the two facilities during the study period. Visits exhibited a cyclic pattern over the 3 years that varied according to the island's dry (January-May) and wet (June-December) seasons. There were more visits during the wet season than the dry (40 [SD=2] vs. 32 [SD=2] visits/day; P<0.001). The results of multiple regression indicated that season (P<0.001), barometric pressure (P<0.001), temperature difference (P<0.001), minimum temperature2 (P<0.001) and wind speed2 (P=0.032) were predictors of paediatric visits. Independent predictors of adult visits were season (P<0.001), relative humidity (P<0.001), minimum temperature (P=0.01), temperature difference2 (P<0.001) and minimum temperature2 (P=0.004). Season and climatic variables explained 18% of the variance of the total A&E asthma admissions., CONCLUSION: There is seasonal variation in acute asthma visits to A&E facilities in Trinidad, which remains significant after controlling for climate variables. However, while climate has a role, there are other factors that may also be responsible for increased visits during the wet season. More research is needed to identify these factors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: It has been proposed that early age at bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination protects against the development of allergy., OBJECTIVE: To study whether early age at BCG vaccination was associated with a decreased risk of atopy, allergic rhinitis, and asthma compared to BCG vaccination at later ages in childhood., METHODS: The occurrence of atopy, allergic rhinitis, and asthma was studied in nearly 2000 women participating in the Danish National Birth Cohort study. Detailed information on age at BCG vaccination (age 0-15 years) was available from school health records. Atopic status was assessed serologically by a specific response to 11 common inhalant allergens using serum samples obtained from the women during the period 1997-2001. Information on allergic rhinitis and asthma was available from telephone interviews., RESULTS: Approximately 85% of the women had been BCG-vaccinated. Age at BCG vaccination was not associated with risk of atopy, allergic rhinitis, or asthma. The odds ratio of atopy, allergic rhinitis, and asthma associated with being vaccinated during the first year of life was 1.05 (95% CI 0.71-1.56), 1.42 (95% CI 0.85-2.36), and 1.71 (95% CI 0.91-3.20), respectively, compared with being vaccinated at the age of 7 years. Adjustment for birth cohort, sibship size, age of the woman's mother at birth, and social class in childhood did not affect the results., CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that age at BCG vaccination in childhood does not influence the development of allergy or asthma.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Fetal life events may affect the development of the immune and/or respiratory system and increase the risk of asthma and allergic diseases. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that pregnancy complications are associated with the risk of developing asthma in the off-spring., METHODS: The study population comprised Norwegian live births 1967-1993 (n = 1,548,429) linking the Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN) (exposure variables) and the National Insurance Administration Register (NIAR) (outcome variables), which covers all Norwegians. The MBRN variables included pregnancy complications, pregnancy outcomes and diseases of the mother. The NIAR provided data on all Norwegians who had received cash benefit for treatment of asthma from 1967 to 1996 (n = 5938, 3.9/1000 persons)., RESULTS: In multiple logistic regression analysis, pregnancy complications (International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-8-codes: 630-634) were associated with the risk of asthma (odds ratio 1.82, 95% confidence interval: 1.67-1.98). This was also the case if analyses were performed in different strata according to year of birth, plurality, maternal atopy, geographical district of birth, and maternal education., CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy complications may represent risk factors for the development of asthma in the offspring or express early signs of increased risk for developing the disease.

N2  - The aim of this study was to determine the relative frequency of underlying illnesses for recurrent pneumonia in children. Children who had two or more episodes of pneumonia per year, or three or more episodes in a lifetime were investigated retrospectively at Ankara University Medical School, Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, between January 1997 and October 2002. Out of 788 children hospitalized for pneumonia, 71 (9 per cent) met the criteria for recurrent pneumonia. An underlying illness was demonstrated in 60 patients (85 per cent). In this group, the underlying illness was diagnosed prior to pneumonia in 11 patients (18.3 per cent), during the first episode in 12 patients (20 per cent), and during recurrence in 37 patients (61.7 per cent). Underlying diseases were bronchial asthma (32 per cent), gastroesophageal reflux (15 per cent), immune disorders (10 per cent), congenital heart defects (9 per cent), anomalies of the chest and lung (6 per cent), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (4 per cent), cystic fibrosis (3 per cent), tuberculosis (3 per cent), and aspiration syndrome (3 per cent). No predisposing illness could be demonstrated in 11 patients (15 per cent). In conclusion, approximately one-tenth of hospitalized children with pneumonia in our hospital had recurrent pneumonia. Most of these children had an underlying illness, which was demonstrated by intensive investigation. Bronchial asthma in children aged more than 2 years and gastroesophageal reflux in children aged less than 1 year were the most common underlying illnesses for recurrent pneumonia.

T1  - Identifying the child in need of asthma therapy.
A1  - Szefler, Stanley J
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Based on the results of the long-term CAMP clinical trial in childhood asthma, the benefits of continuous long-term use of inhaled glucocorticoid on asthma control are clear. Studies are in progress to evaluate whether early intervention with inhaled glucocorticoids can alter the natural history of asthma. Indicators are now being defined to identify the patient at risk for persistent asthma and thus to identify candidates for early intervention. Given the right medication and the patient profile, it may be possible to induce remission or even a cure. Patients with severe asthma have low pulmonary function that is difficult to improve, however. It will be important to recognize patients at risk for severe asthma and to intervene more effectively to prevent asthma progression. None of these advances will be possible without a comprehensive approach to asthma care including the ready access to health care. Although it seems that the rise in asthma mortality and morbidity has reached a plateau, there are significant racial and ethic disparities in asthma health care use and mortality. The goal should now be to strive for a reduction in asthma morbidity and mortality. A high proportion of asthma morbidity among inner-city children may be related to nonadherence; therefore targeting management approaches to improve adherence could prove effective in reducing morbidity. Recommendations have been made to integrate available resources in the United States to improve overall asthma outcomes for children.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Following community concern regarding potential health effects associated with odors of a wastewater treatment plant, a descriptive epidemiological study was conducted to assess the complaints and the health status of the community and to identify potentially more susceptible groups., METHODS: Questionnaires were administered by telephone to nearly 3.000 subjects, randomly selected in the 8 nearby towns, using a geographical Information System. Residents of three areas were compared, according to the distance from the site: 0-1.5 km (high exposed group), 1.5-3 km (moderate exposed group) and 3-4.5 km (low exposed group). Questions measured demographic characteristics, concerns, perceived environmental risk and health effects (symptoms in the past 1 month and in the past 1 year). Multivariate logistic models study the relationships of complaints and health effects, with area and susceptibility factors., RESULTS: Two thousand eight hundred and sixty seven eligible adults participated in an interview. Taking in account confounding factors, population of high and moderate exposed groups reported more odor complaints than the low exposed group, with adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 4.73 (CI95%: 3.63-6.14) and 2.06 (CI95%: 1.59-2.66) respectively. But these 2 groups did not report more frequent health effects compared to the low exposed group. Several health effects were significantly more frequent in persons with self-reported chemical intolerance and in persons considering malodor in terms of health threat. In this last sub-group of population, rhinitis were significantly more frequent in the high exposed group compared to low exposed group, whereas respiratory infections and asthma attacks showed the same non significant patterns., CONCLUSION: If 24,2% of the total sample complaints from odors of the site, this study did not show a higher frequency of health effects in people living near the site (high exposed group). But 2 susceptible groups (with a higher frequency of symptoms potentially related to odors) were identified: persons with self-reported chemical intolerance, among those, many allergic and asthmatic subjects, and persons considering malodor in terms of health threat.

T1  - A retrospective population based trend analysis on hospital admissions for lower respiratory illness among Swedish children from 1987 to 2000.
A1  - Bjor, Ove
A1  - Braback, Lennart
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Data relating to hospital admissions of very young children for wheezing illness have been conflicting. Our primary aim was to assess whether a previous increase in hospital admissions for lower respiratory illness had continued in young Swedish children. We have included re-admissions in our analyses in order to evaluate the burden of lower respiratory illness in very young children. We have also assessed whether changes in the labelling of symptoms have affected the time trend., METHODS: A retrospective, population based study was conducted to assess the time trend in admissions and re-admissions for lower respiratory illness. Data were obtained from the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register for all children with a first hospital admission before nine years of age, a total of 109,176 children. The register covers more than 98% of all hospital admissions in Sweden. The coding of diagnoses was based on ICD-9 from 1987 to 1996 and ICD-10 from 1997., RESULTS: The first admission rates declined significantly in children with a first admission after two years of age. However, an increasing admission trend was observed in children aged less than one year and 35% of first admissions occurred in this age group. The annual increase was 3.8% (95% CI 1.3-6.3) in boys and 5.0% (95% CI 2.4-7.6) in girls. A diagnostic shift appeared to occur when ICD-10 was introduced in 1997. The asthma and pneumonia admission rate in children aged less than one year levelled off, whereas the increase in admissions for bronchitis continued. The re-admission rates for asthma decreased and the probability of re-admission was higher in boys. National drug statistics demonstrated a substantial increase in the delivery of inhaled steroids to all age groups but most prescriptions occurred to children aged one year or more., CONCLUSION: Hospital admissions for lower respiratory illness are still increasing in children aged <1 year. Our findings are in line with other recent studies suggesting a change in the responsiveness to viral infections in very young children, but changes in admission criteria cannot be excluded. An increased use of inhaled steroids may have contributed to decreasing re-admission rates.

N2  - BACKGROUND: No objective clinical risk factors exist for pediatric life-threatening asthma., OBJECTIVES: In this study, we address whether persistent food allergy and degree of atopy are risk factors for life-threatening asthma., METHODS: By use of a case-controlled design, children (1-16 years) ventilated for an exacerbation of asthma were enrolled. Each case was matched by sex, age, and ethnicity, with 2 controls who had attended with a non-life-threatening exacerbation. All subjects were assessed by means of a questionnaire, spirometry, and skin prick or RAST testing. The data were analyzed by conditional logistic regression., RESULTS: Nineteen cases and 38 controls were enrolled. Compared with controls, cases were found to have the following risk factors: food allergy (odds ratio, 8.58; 95% CI, 1.85-39.71), multiple allergic diagnoses (4.42; 1.17-16.71), early onset of asthma (6.48; 1.36-30.85), and frequent admissions (14.2; 1.77-113.59). After regression analysis, only frequent admission with asthma (9.85; 1.04-93.27) and food allergy (5.89; 1.06-32.61) were independently associated with life-threatening asthma. Half the cases had food allergy compared with only 10% of controls., CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that poorly controlled asthma and food allergy are significant risk factors for life-threatening asthma. More intensive management of this high-risk group of children might help to reduce future morbidity and mortality.

T1  - Asthma prevalence among Alaska Native and nonnative residents younger than 20 years enrolled in Medicaid.
A1  - Gessner, Bradford D
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - BACKGROUND: No study of childhood asthma prevalence in Alaska or among Alaska Natives has been conducted., OBJECTIVE: To determine asthma prevalence among Alaska Medicaid enrollees younger than 20 years, with an emphasis on Alaska Natives, the state's largest minority and predominant rural citizens., METHODS: A master database was obtained that included all children enrolled in Medicaid during July 1998 through June 1999. Physician, pharmacy, and hospital claims files for International Classification of Diseases codes 493.0x to 493.9x were linked to this master database. Asthma was defined as any asthma-related care or medication claim., RESULTS: Asthma prevalence among the study population was 6.9%. Alaska Natives had a lower asthma prevalence than nonnatives (risk ratio [RR], 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66-0.75), but among the subgroup of children residing in the state's major urban center, Alaska Natives had a higher prevalence. Overall, 0.22% of the study population experienced an asthma-related hospitalization, with Alaska Natives having a higher risk of hospitalization than nonnatives (RR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.3). Among hospitalized children, Alaska Natives were less likely to have received a long-term control medication (RR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.33-0.88)., CONCLUSIONS: Compared with nonnatives, Alaska Natives have a lower risk of asthma but only among nonurban residents. The increased risk of hospitalization among Alaska Natives may be related to underuse of long-term control medications.

N2  - Child death due to asthma is a rare and potentially preventable event. We investigated possible risk factors for death due to asthma in children and adolescents, as a step towards preventing or minimizing asthma death in this age group, and improving asthma management and care. We reviewed all 108 cases of asthma death in 1-19-year-olds in Denmark, 1973-1994. Copies of death certificates, hospital records, information from general practitioners, and autopsy records were obtained. The information was assessed with particular reference to: features and duration of asthma before death; severity of asthma; time and place of death; long-term and ongoing medical treatment; quality of medical care; circumstances of final illness; and medical treatment during the final episode of asthma. Age groups of 1-4 years, 5-14 years, and 15-19 years were analyzed separately and in aggregate. Death occurred predominantly in the 15-19-year age group. Generally, significantly more patients died in the summer. These patients were more atopic, had fewer asthma symptoms, and did not have regular asthma consultations. Nearly all patients had early-onset asthma. The 1-4-year age group was characterized by severe asthma. Major risk factors (all age groups) were: gradual deterioration during the last month; length of final attack (>3 hr); and delay in seeking medical help during the final attack. None of the children died during their first attack. Nonadherence was most frequent among the 15-19-year-olds. All asthmatic children and young adults should regularly receive medical care and assessment, even if they suffer only a few symptoms. This study underlines the need for ongoing education of the patient's family, the patient, and doctors on long-term management and management of acute attacks. Copies of clearly written individual plans for periods with increasing symptoms should be supplied to the patient/family and, where appropriate, to their general practitioners. The object of these measures is that the patient and parents/family learn to recognize the signs of deterioration and to act on them. Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Our objective was to test the hypothesis that the risk of childhood leukemia is associated with allergies or a family history of allergy. We used a German population-based case-control study with self-reported information on allergies of the children and their first-degree relatives. Our study included a total of 1,130 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 164 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 2,957 controls. A major finding of our study is that hay fever, neurodermatitis and contact eczema are underrepresented within the group of children with ALL, with respective odds ratios (OR) of 0.45 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31-0.66) for hay fever, of 0.49 (CI 0.34-0.71) for neurodermatitis and of 0.62 (CI 0.39-0.99) for eczema, respectively. Atopic diseases, comprising hay fever, neurodermatitis and asthma, are much stronger related with a reduced risk of ALL than other allergies (OR 0.52, CI 0.40-0.67 vs. OR 0.89, CI 0.66-1.21). The strongest association is seen with an atopy in the index child; however, ALL risk is also reduced if one of the parents or a sibling had an atopic disease. No such consistent pattern is seen for AML. Our data suggest that atopy or a family history of atopy are associated with a reduced risk of childhood ALL. Recall bias remains a concern, but sensitivity analysis provided some evidence that the protective effect is unlikely to be attributable to this bias in its entirety. Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

T1  - Contribution of neuroimmune mechanisms to airway inflammation and remodeling during and after respiratory syncytial virus infection.
A1  - Piedimonte, Giovanni
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - A number of studies have implicated severe infections early in life as a risk factor for the subsequent development of asthma. In particular it has been suggested that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection may enhance the development of "allergic" inflammatory responses when the host is exposed to allergens after an episode of bronchiolitis. It has also been suggested that neuronal mechanisms are important in RSV infection and subsequent airway hyperreactivity. Recently we advanced the hypothesis that immune and neuronal mechanisms may be linked and that combined neuroimmune responses may be in play. In the airways a dense network of sensory nerve fibers is strategically placed just below the epithelial surface so that any change in the bronchial environment may stimulate the release of the proinflammatory neuropeptide substance P. During RSV infection, stimulation of these nerves causes a marked increase in airway vascular permeability over that in pathogen-free rats and results in an increase in overall inflammatory status. Our work has revealed that these changes are mediated by the high affinity receptor for substance P [neurokinin (NK) 1 receptor], the expression of which is greatly increased by RSV. This up-regulation presumably occurs at the gene expression level, as NK1 receptor mRNA levels increase substantially during RSV infection. We have also shown that T lymphocyte subpopulations within the bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue in the lungs of RSV-infected rats express high levels of the NK1 receptor. As a consequence stimulation of the sensory nerves by any airborne irritant has the potential of causing a new inflammatory cycle mediated by NK1 receptor-expressing T lymphocytes attracted into the airways and activated by substance P. This mechanism may establish important neuroimmune interactions, which undergo long term dysregulation after RSV infection and predispose to airway inflammation and hyperreactivity. Finally our most recent studies show that RSV infection promotes a large increase in the expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) and neurotrophin receptors. RSV-induced release of NGF leads to short and long term changes in the distribution and reactivity of sensory nerves across the respiratory tract, participating to exaggerated inflammatory reactions during and after the infection. NGF and its receptors may also amplify other immunoinflammatory and neuronal pathways contributing to airway inflammation and hyperreactivity. On the basis of these observations, we postulate that changes of neurotrophin expression in the respiratory tract may represent an important link between early life viral infections and childhood asthma.

T1  - Respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis and the pathogenesis of childhood asthma.
A1  - Martinez, Fernando D
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - There is now convincing evidence that children who develop lower respiratory symptoms during infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in early life are at increased risk of developing asthma-like symptoms during the school years. What determines this association is not well-understood, but increased likelihood of allergic sensitization plays a minor role, if any, as a determinant of post-RSV wheeze. Current evidence suggests that both genetic and environmental factors determine the type of immune response to the acute RSV infection and that this response, in turn, may affect the development of the control mechanisms involved in the regulation of airway tone. Many different cytokines appear to play a role in this acute immune response, including interferon-gamma; interleukins 8, 10 and 12; and cytokines produced by T helper (Th) 1 and Th2 cells. Because asthma is a heterogeneous condition, future studies will need to determine the potentially different role of RSV infection as a risk factor for these different asthma phenotypes. It is likely, however, that strategies for the prevention of RSV infection may play a role in the prevention of the subsequent development of persistent wheezing and asthma-like symptoms in childhood.

N2  - During the last few decades there has ben a significant rise in the prevalence of allergic diseases such as asthma, hay fever and atopic dermatitis. Epidemiological studies strongly suggest that this increase is real and not due to changes in diagnostic labelling. It has become increasingly clear that a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors account for this phenomenon. Genetically predisposed individuals are at an increased susceptibility to develop asthma or other allergic diseases when exposed to certain environmental or lifestyle factors. Particularly passive smoking has been shown to increase the risk for asthma in many studies and for atopy at least in some studies. This association is less clear for the exposure to sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, diesel exhaust and ozone. Lifestyle factors like socioeconomic status, sib-ship size, early childhood infections, dietary habits, growing up in antroposophic families or on a farm are more and more realised to be of great relevance for the development of allergic conditions. At the moment, there is a lot of uncertainty about which recommendations should be given for primary prevention. Recent studies have challenged the old paradigma that avoidance of early allergen contact could prevent the development of allergic disease. However, there is consensus that avoidance of smoking during pregnancy and avoidance of passive smoking during childhood should be recommended for primary prevention of asthma.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Asthma is a common chronic condition with significant impact on those who have it. Information about children with asthma was sought to guide state program planning., METHODS: A random-digit-dial telephone survey of 1503 households with 2700 children was conducted in Georgia. Primary caretakers were interviewed. Results for households, children, and caretakers were weighted by number of telephone lines; results for children were also weighted to the Georgia 1998 estimated population. Data were collected and analyzed in 2000., RESULTS: Asthma prevalence among children in Georgia aged 0 to 17 years was 10.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]=9.2%-11.9%). Among children with asthma, 64.8% (95% CI= 58.5-71.1) had an attack and 30.0% (95% CI=24.2-35.8) visited an emergency department in the last year. In the past year, 53.9% (95% CI=46.8-61.0) of school-aged children with asthma and 29.7% (95% CI=23.7-35.7) of adults in households of children with asthma missed school or work because of the child's asthma. Among children with asthma, 56.1% (95% CI=48.6-63.6) lived in a household where neither caretaker nor child has taken a course or been taught about managing asthma, and 28.6% (95% CI=22.1-35.1) lived in a household where adults smoked inside the house., CONCLUSIONS: Asthma has a substantial effect on the lives of children in Georgia, including medical events and missed school, and on adult caretakers in terms of missed work due to the child's asthma. To reduce the burden of asthma in Georgia, exposure of people with asthma to tobacco smoke in the home should be eliminated and training in asthma management should be more widely available.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Influenza places a substantial burden on the affected individual and society. While there are data available on the overall occurrence of influenza in children, less information is available on the differential impact of influenza on healthcare for previously healthy children and those at high risk of developing influenza-related complications., OBJECTIVE: To compare the frequency of influenza-related complications in healthy and 'at-risk' children, and quantify the associated use of medical resources and costs., DESIGN: Data were obtained from a large US-based health insurance plan database., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: A total of 23 188 health insurance claims with an influenza diagnosis were identified over the 3-year period 1995-1997 (3 247 834 patient-years). Influenza-related complications were observed in approximately a quarter of the total diagnosed cases, with younger children (0-4 years of age) at substantially greater risk. 'At-risk' children were more likely to develop influenza-related complications than otherwise healthy children. The greatest difference in incidence rate in the 0-4 year age group was for asthma (incidence rate ratio 8.7, 95% CI 5.2-14.4), and in the 5-14 year age group for asthma (incidence rate ratio 8.5, 95% CI 5.2-13.7) and acute sinusitis (incidence rate ratio 2.7, 95% CI 1.2-5.4). The average direct medical costs of influenza in children under 15 years with complications were more than 3.5 times higher than those without., CONCLUSIONS: Measures to prevent and treat influenza-related complications are certainly warranted for at-risk children, although the elevated incidence rates for several common complications even among healthy children should prompt consideration of these measures for all children.

T1  - Clinical patterns and natural history of asthma.
A1  - Weinberger, Miles
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Childhood asthma typically begins in infancy with a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Although the majority of infants become infected with RSV, lower respiratory illness develops in only about 20%. About 25% to 50% of those subsequently experience recurrent acute asthma from viral respiratory infections (VRI). Children younger than 5 years have a high frequency of VRI and have the highest frequency of hospitalization for asthma of any age group. In a 35-year study of the natural history of asthma, 20% of 7-year-old children were found to have asthma, but most had only episodic illness with VRI. The majority of those children improved with age, but a substantial minority continued to have recurrent episodes as adults, generally induced by VRI or exercise. Persistent asthma developed in only a few. Children who had symptoms of asthma without VRI were more likely to continue having frequent episodic or chronic asthma as adults. Despite generally suboptimal treatment during the 35 years of the study, forced expiratory volume at one second did not deteriorate over time; it remained normal in children who had only episodic asthma, and it was consistently low in the children with severe, persistent asthma.

T1  - Early pet exposure: friend or foe?.
A1  - Simpson, Angela
A1  - Custovic, Adnan
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sensitization to pets is a risk factor for asthma and it was assumed that pet ownership was a risk factor for sensitization. Epidemiological studies failed to confirm this, some even suggesting that keeping pets decreased the risk of sensitization and asthma. In the last year, 10 studies have been published which have, at least in part, attempted to address the question. The results, however, are heterogeneous and it is still not clear how we should advise our patients on this issue of pet ownership., RECENT FINDINGS: Results of studies of the association between exposure to cat or cat allergen and the development of sensitization are such that almost any view on the relationship could be supported by evidence from the literature. For dogs, there are fewer data, but there is little to suggest that keeping a dog increases the risk of sensitization to dog. The majority of studies reviewed find either no association or a reduced risk of asthma amongst pet owners, but only one of these selectively excludes those who deliberately avoid pets from the analysis. There is evidence to suggest that amongst non-pet owners, the risk of sensitization and of asthma increases in areas with a high proportion of pet owners. There is evidence emerging that the effect of exposure to pets may be different in different relative risk groups, based on parental allergy. There is also evidence that asthma is more severe amongst pet sensitized pet owners., SUMMARY: There are several large birth cohort studies being conducted around the world designed to measure the development of asthma and allergies in children with prospective and objective measures of environmental exposures. The results of such studies are required before the association between pets and asthma can be determined.

N2  - Asthma, one of the most important chronic diseases of children, disproportionately affects minority and low-income children. Many environmental risk factors for asthma have been identified, including animal, mite, and other allergens; cigarette smoke; and air pollutants. Genetics also play an important causative role, as indicated by familial aggregation and the identification of candidate genes and chromosomal regions linked to asthma risk. Using a positive family history of asthma to identify children at increased risk could provide a basis for targeted prevention efforts, aimed at reducing exposure to environmental risk factors. To assess the predictive value of family history as an indicator of risk for childhood asthma, we reviewed population-based studies that evaluated family history of asthma and atopic disease in children with asthma. Our search identified 33 studies from all geographic regions of the world for review. The studies varied in definitions of positive family history and asthma phenotype and used study populations with asthma prevalence ranging from 2% to 26%. Nevertheless, family history of asthma in one or more first-degree relatives was consistently identified as a risk factor for asthma. In ten studies, sensitivity and predictive value of a positive family history of asthma could be calculated: sensitivity ranged from 4% to 43%, positive predictive value from 11% to 37%, and negative predictive value from 86% to 97%. Although a positive family history predicts an increased risk of asthma, it identifies a minority of children at risk. Positive family history may have utility in targeting some individual prevention efforts, but the low positive predictive value limits its value as a means to direct environmental remediation efforts.

This study aimed at determining the rates of diagnosis and treatment of childhood asthma among medical practitioners. Relevant information on 45 asthmatic children was collected using pre-tested questionnaires. There were 30 (66.7%) males and 15 (33.3%) females (M:F, 2:1). Mean age, average ages for onset of symptoms and diagnosis of asthma were 9.4 years, 1.8 years and 6.6 years respectively. An average of 4 previous medical consultations were undertaken for asthma symptoms, but only 11 (24.4%) cases were labeled as asthma. Alternative diagnostic labels including allergy, bronchitis (wheezy), pneumonia (chest infection), and tuberculosis, were used in 29 (64.4%). Five (11.1%) cases were unlabelled. Alternative labeling for asthma was associated with frequent usage of non-bronchodilator medications including antihistamines, antibiotics, antituberculous drugs, cough mixtures, and herbal concoctions. Only 15 (33.3%) cases received bronchodilators, rarely prescribed regularly in the absence of asthma label. This study reveals low diagnosis and treatment rates for asthma, emphasising the need to audit the management of childhood asthma among medical practitioners, with the view of providing information.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Acute asthma relapse following treatment and discharge from hospital remains a substantial problem. Various potential risk factors for relapse have been reported including age, sex, frequency of hospitalization and emergency medications. All these factors, however, may not be generalized for all patients because of difference in prevalence, trigger factors, types of allergens, medical accessibility and psychosocial problems., OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with relapse following treatment for acute asthma within the next 8 weeks in Thai children., MATERIAL AND METHOD: The authors prospectively followed 91 children discharged from Ramathibodi Hospital after treatment of an asthma attack from June 1999 to December 2000. Parents were surveyed concerning their child's medical history, trigger factors, psychosocial and economic variables. Data on severity of the attack, asthma scores, emergency treatment, and response to treatment were recorded. Investigations included eosinophil count, total IgE, serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), skin test, methacholine bronchial challenge test, and IQ test were performed and recorded., RESULTS: Within the first week, only 6.6 per cent had relapsed and increased to 29.7 per cent by 8 weeks. Patients who suffered relapse were more likely associated with age at asthma diagnosis (OR, 2.90; 95% CI, 1.1-7.5) and 6 years of age or under (OR 4.49, CI 1.22-16.54). From the investigation results including eosinophil count, total IgE, serum ECP, skin test, methacholine bronchial challenge test, and IQ test, there was no significant difference in the factors between patients who suffered relapse and those who did not. From the psychosocial evaluation, 18 out 39 (46.2%) studied cases had significant psychosocial disorders. They were 4 cases with delayed development and mental retardation, 9 cases with parent-child relation problems, and 2 cases with serious intrafamilial disorders. Most of these patients were non-relapse cases. However, the relationship between asthma relapse and psychosocial disorders could not be ascertained since psychosocial evaluation was only performed in one-third of the study population., CONCLUSION: Among patients following acute asthma therapy, 29.7 per cent will have a relapse. The authors identified the age at onset of asthma before the age of 6 years as an important risk factor. This may help to decrease the relapse rate by more intensive and comprehensive management among patients at high risk.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To survey the prevalence of asthma in urban and rural residents of Liaoning province in 1999 and evaluate the risk factors for asthma, providing data for research and preventive and therapeutic policies for control of asthma., METHODS: Stratified cluster disproportional random sampling survey was performed in 116 276 residents by common protocols and questionnaire. Asthma was diagnosed based upon case history, clinical signs and lung function tests. Univariate analysis was employed to evaluate the risk factors for asthma., RESULTS: The overall prevalence of asthma in Liaoning province was 1.25%, the male to female ratio being 1:1.64. The prevalence of asthma in adults was 1.39% and that in children was 0.48%. The onset of asthma occurring in children under the age of 14 accounted for 38.63% of the whole patients. The prevalence was higher in peasants, animal breeders and government officials. The prevalence in the rural area (1.89%) was higher than that in the urban area (0.81%) (P < 0.01). The prevalence in Shenyang city (1.66%) was higher than those in Dalian city (0.88%) (P < 0.01) and Jinzhou (0.71%) (P < 0.01) city. Risk factor analysis showed that 24.7% of the asthmatics had family history; 20.4% had allergic history, the OR of allergic rhinitis being 6.28; 26.0% had smoking history; the OR of cooking oil smoke exposure was 5.94. Asthmatic attack was induced by influenza, cold air, irritant gases and cooking oil smoke in 52.3% approximately 63.3% of the patients. Asthma induced by exercising, fatigue, emotion and allergy was found in more than 41.3% of the patients., CONCLUSIONS: Our epidemiologic data reflected the general distribution of asthma in Liaoning province. From the overall prevalence rate, it is estimated that there are about 529 700 asthmatics in the whole province. The data will be helpful for the mass prevention and treatment of asthma.

N2  - Bronchial asthma is related to a high morbidity rate, leading to an increasing frequency of emergency room visits and hospital admissions. The aim of this study was to identify severity risk factors for childhood asthma related to hospitalization. The authors studied 124 children admitted to the hospital for asthma, during a 2-year period, correlating the obtained data with a sample of outpatients with asthma matched by age, gender, and socioeconomic status. A standardized questionnaire and skin-prick tests (SPTs) were performed on all children. The significant and independent risk factors identified for hospital admission were prior asthma hospitalization (OR = 7.63; 95% CI = 1.5-39.6; p = 0.01) and last-year admission (OR = 3.18; 95% CI = 1.1-8.9; p = 0.02), environmental tobacco-smoke exposure (OR = 6.63; 95% CI = 2.5-17.8; p = 0.002), allergen sensitization (OR = 3.86; 95% CI = 1.4-10.7; p = 0.009), family history of maternal asthma (OR = 3.58; 95% CI = 1.3-9.6; p = 0.01), and onset of symptoms before 12 months of age (OR = 2.76; 95% CI = 1.0-7.9; p = 0.06). Attendance at day care or kindergarten (OR = 0.38; 95% CI = 0.2-0.9; p = 0.04) and large family size (OR = 0.25; 95% CI = 0.1-0.8; p = 0.01) could be protective factors. Our results stress the importance of early diagnosis and specialized medical care of childhood asthma, mainly in high-risk children, with emphasis on medication planning and the establishment of preventive measures such as environmental tobacco smoke avoidance and limitation of aeroallergen exposure.

T1  - Early intervention for asthma prevention in children.
A1  - Liu, Andrew H
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - The last few decades have seen a global rise in asthma prevalence. In the United States, based on the National Health Interview Survey sample in 1998, the National Center for Health Statistics determined that asthma was the most commonly diagnosed chronic disease of childhood, with 12.1% or 8.65 million U.S. children reported as being diagnosed with asthma in their lifetime. As a result, asthma pathogenesis has received much attention, with the hope of reversing this concerning global trend by developing new approaches to asthma prevention. Current evidence suggests that most childhood asthma begins in the early years. In addition, early pathogenic development of the immune systems and lungs of children with asthma suggests that the early years may be the best time for preventive intervention. To consider intervention for asthma in early childhood (i.e., in the first 6 years of life), we will discuss (1) childhood risk factors for chronic persistent asthma, (2) early pathogenic changes in asthma, (3) potential pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the young asthmaprone child, and (4) potential future immune modulatory therapies and prevention.

N2  - UNLABELLED: The group of general paediatrics of the French Paediatrics Society conducted a case-control study in order to verify the link between the occurrence of an acute bronchiolitis early during the first year of life, more specifically during the first trimester, and asthma during later childhood., METHODS: Parents of 4-to-12-year-old children answered a questionnaire during a general paediatrics visit. Exposition was attested by a diagnosis of bronchiolitis mentioned on the personal health record of the child. Environmental factors and medical history, obtained from the parents and by checking the health record of the child, were studied using multivariate analysis., RESULTS: Nineteen paediatricians included 80 children with asthma and 160 controls. Fifty-four per cent of asthmatic children had a medical history of bronchiolitis during the first year of life versus 17% of control children (P < 0.001). Mean age of bronchiolitis occurrence was 6.6 months in both groups (P = 0.98). Multivariate analysis showed that occurrence of bronchiolitis during the first year of life was significantly more frequent in asthmatic children (P < 0.001, OR = 5.6, IC95 = [2.6-11.6]) but this effect was not observed during the first trimester of life., CONCLUSION: Bronchiolitis during the first year of life was significantly related to later asthma in 4-to-12-year-old children treated by general paediatricians. On the other hand, a very early bronchiolitis during the first trimester of life did not appear, in our set of data, as a contributive factor to explain asthma in later childhood.

A1  - Wright, Anne L
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Cohort studies have provided the foundation for much of our knowledge of childhood asthma. Four important lessons have been learned from these longitudinal studies: that asthma is a complex disease, encompassing many phenotypes; that it is linked to the development of the immune system and respiratory tract in the first years of life; that early life events strongly affect the development of asthma risk and that relationships between certain exposures and asthma risk are age dependent. The Tucson Children's Respiratory Study is used to exemplify these lessons and to illustrate the advantages of cohort studies in investigating a complex disease. Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

N2  - Asthma in Puerto Rico is a serious Public Health Problem. This study extends our cross-sectional self-reported asthma prevalence survey of 3,000 volunteers. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the importance of known prognostic factors of asthma severity among 486 self-reported participants. Patients with more than one visit to the emergency room in the previous 12 months due to asthma exacerbations were classified as cases of "severe asthma", and those asthmatic patients who did not visit emergency rooms were classified as "non-severe asthmatic subjects". Severe cases and non-severe asthmatic subjects were compared regarding age, sex, family history of asthma, presence of household pets, and in the previous 12 months: history of hospitalization due to asthma, respiratory infections, tobacco smoking, exposure to passive smoking, and avoidance of passive smoking. Crude and logistic regression adjusted odds ratio was used as a measure of association between each prognostic factor, and the outcome namely severe asthma, while adjusting for all confounders simultaneously. The results clearly showed that previous hospitalizations due to asthma (OR = 7.3, p < 0.0001) and frequent of respiratory infection (OR = 2.5, p = 0.0003) were prognostic factors associated with increased asthma severity. A statistically significant, two percent less likelihood to have severe asthma for each year of age was found. Weak associations were found between asthma severity and male gender, family history of asthma, passive smoking, and presence of household pets. Avoidance of environmental tobacco exposure (passive smoking) was found to be an important and statistically significant protective factor associated with a 47% less likelihood for severe asthma. In conclusion, appropriate management of patients with history of hospitalization due to asthma is very important. The correct management of respiratory infection in asthmatic patients may result in a reduction of up to 60 percent of the odds of having asthma severe enough to require emergency treatment, and may reduced by 86.3 percent hospitalizations.

N2  - The etiology of allergic disease is not understood, but a decreased exposure to infection may play an important role. There are few published data on the impact of change in microbial exposure during pregnancy on the child's risk of developing allergic disease. Using a birth cohort of 24,690 children, derived from the West Midlands General Practice Research Database, we investigated a number of perinatal exposures on the incidence of asthma, eczema, and hay fever. Our findings suggest that exposure to antibiotics in utero is associated with an increased risk of asthma in a dose-related manner (more than two courses of antibiotics compared with none adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.51-1.87), and similar associations are present for eczema (adjusted HR 1.17; 95% CI, 1.06-1.29) and hay fever (adjusted HR 1.56; 95% CI, 1.22-2.01). Exposure to a range of infections in utero was also associated with a small increased risk of developing allergic disease. Strong protective effects of older siblings on the incidence of allergy are present within this cohort, but previous pregnancies that did not result in a live birth were not protective. Our findings suggest that exposure to antibiotics and to infections in utero is a potentially important risk factor in the development of allergic disease.

T1  - Is prevention of childhood asthma possible? Allergens, infections and animals.
A1  - Tang, Mimi L K
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - What we know: Epidemiological studies have identified a number of factors associated with increased incidence of asthma. These include allergen sensitisation and exposure, reduced exposure to infections and to farm animals in early childhood, and maternal smoking. These factors may represent "true" risk factors for asthma or may be merely associated factors that do not in themselves cause asthma. The "hygiene hypothesis" has been proposed as one mechanism by which infections may protect against asthma. Current recommendations for the primary prevention of asthma include exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life, avoidance of maternal smoking during pregnancy and infancy, and reducing the levels of house-dust mite in some environments. What we need to know: What are the mechanisms by which specific risk factors and prevention strategies lead to or protect from asthma? How do genetic and environmental factors interact to increase the risk of asthma?

N2  - What we know: Asthma is a disease of mucosal and immunological development. If a child's first episode of wheeze occurs in the first year of life, the child has about a 50% chance of developing asthma. If a child develops recurrent wheeze, the probability that it is related to asthma rises to about 80%. The presence of atopy, positive allergen skin-prick tests or elevated IgE antibody levels increases the probability of asthma to over 95%. Evidence of changes in lung function or of inflammation confirms a diagnosis of asthma. What we need to know: Can an algorithm be created for general practitioners to predict the likelihood of the development of asthma on the basis of presenting symptoms and relevant investigations? Is it feasible to use regular lung function testing or induced sputum samples to monitor the development of asthma in early childhood? How can we better understand in-utero programming for asthma? What characteristics of airway mucosal maturation are associated with the development of asthma? What deviations from normal immunological development are associated with the development of asthma?

N2  - Infants who recover from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-induced bronchiolitis are at high risk of developing asthma and recurrent wheezing. It is not known whether severe RSV infection itself causes persistent effects or is a marker of a "wheezy" predisposition. To determine the long-term immunological correlates of infantile bronchiolitis, interleukin (IL)-4 and interferon (IFN)-gamma responses to a panel of antigens were studied in a well-characterised cohort of 7-8-yr-old children with a history of severe RSV bronchiolitis in infancy. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from 37 children who were hospitalised with RSV bronchiolitis in infancy and from 69 age-, sex- and location-matched controls were stimulated in vitro with RSV, house-dust mite, birch and cat antigens. Cellular proliferation, and enzyme-linked immunoSPOT IFN-gamma and IL-4 production were measured. IL-4 producing T-cells responding to RSV and cat antigens were significantly more frequent in exbronchiolitics. Other responses (including the IFN-gamma response to RSV) were equally strong in exbronchiolitics and controls. Respiratory syncytial virus infection primes memory T-cells that make interferon-gamma, but virus and aeroallergen-specific and interleukin-4 producing T-cells are also frequently primed in bronchiolitics. Respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis in infancy may increase the risk of allergic sensitisation by providing a local interleukin-4-rich environment, in which airborne allergens are first encountered.

N2  - Relationships between lower respiratory diseases with wheezing during infancy and asthma at school-age remain debatted. Indeed, although epidemiologic studies show that wheezy infants most often become asymptomatic before entry to school, they also demonstrate that severe bronchiolitis during infancy is a significant risk factor for persistence of wheezing episodes at school-age. One of the most important factors demonstrated to enhance the risk for persistence of asthma is an early allergic sensitization.

N2  - BACKGROUND: A few previous studies have suggested that childhood vaccines, particularly whole cell pertussis vaccine, may increase the risk of asthma. We evaluated the suggested association between childhood vaccinations and risk of asthma., METHODS: Cohort study involving 167,240 children who were enrolled in 4 large health maintenance organizations during 1991 to 1997, with follow-up from birth until at least 18 months to a maximum of 6 years of age. Vaccinations were ascertained through computerized immunization tracking systems, and onset of asthma was identified through computerized data on medical care encounters and medication dispensings., RESULTS: In the study 18,407 children (11.0%) developed asthma, with a median age at onset of 11 months. The relative risks (95% confidence intervals) of asthma were: 0.92 (0.83 to 1.02) for diphtheria, tetanus and whole cell pertussis vaccine; 1.09 (0.9 to 1.23) for oral polio vaccine; 0.97 (0.91 to 1.04) for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine; 1.18 (1.02 to 1.36) for Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib); and 1.20 (1.13 to 1.27) for hepatitis B vaccine. The Hib result was not consistent across health maintenance organizations. In a subanalysis restricted to children who had at least 2 medical care encounters during their first year, the relative risks decreased to 1.07 (0.71 to 1.60) for Hib and 1.09 (0.88 to 1.34) for hepatitis B vaccine., CONCLUSION: There is no association between diphtheria, tetanus and whole cell pertussis vaccine, oral polio vaccine or measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and the risk of asthma. The weak associations for Hib and hepatitis B vaccines seem to be at least partially accounted for by health care utilization or information bias.

N2  - The prevalence rate of chronic airway's diseases in women and associated risk factors in developing countries are not well clarified. We evaluated the role of indoor duties in the prevalence of asthma, chronic bronchitis, and related symptoms among females in Isfahan suburbs. In three randomly selected villages, 561 responder females (response rate=95.25%) were evaluated through medical interview and physical examinations. Symptoms, signs, occupational and smoking histories, indoor and farming duties, possible outdoor jobs, housing and farming conditions were assessed. The observed respiratory morbidities were: current asthma (11.2%), history of asthma (1.3%), using asthma medications in life (15.2%), chronic bronchitis (3.4%), exercise-induced dyspnea and/or cough (16.2%), and frequent night coughs and/or dyspnea (15.3%). Age, childhood pulmonary infection, bread baking, carpet weaving and using biomass fuels were significant risk factors for all the pulmonary morbidities (P<0.05 to <0.001). Poultry feeding, using kerosene and gas fuels, were less strong risk factors for asthma and chronic bronchitis, respectively Only seven women were current or ex-smokers. Indoor respirable particulate matters were two to four folds more concentrated than outdoors. Women doing indoor jobs in Iran are potential risk factors for development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

N2  - SUMMARY: Environmental factors during early childhood seem to influence the onset of asthma, a disease that affects 10% of all German children, respectively. Prevention strategies are needed to reduce the burden of the disease. Breast feeding and the avoidance of environmental tobacco smoke exposure are recommended for primary prevention. Furthermore, secondary prevention measurements are suggested to reduce the onset of symptoms, once the disease is present.

N2  - The authors investigated the link between children's temperament and the development of asthma and allergies. Prospective longitudinal data on children at the ages of 3-5 months, 3-5 years, and 7-9 years were collected. At age 7-9 years, analyses were performed on data for 3 groups of children (n = 42): those with asthma (no allergies), those with allergies (no asthma), and those with neither asthma nor allergies (the control group). Data for children who developed asthma or allergies prior to age 7-9 years were not analyzed. Differences were found in the premorbid period between the control group and the children who later developed asthma or allergies as well as between the asthma and allergy groups. After onset of illness, no temperamental differences were observed between the 3 groups. The study shows the importance of longitudinal design for asthma research.

T1  - Environmental factors influencing the development and progression of pediatric asthma.
A1  - von Mutius, Erika
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Recent data underscore the importance of environmental factors in the sensitization of children to certain allergens and the development of asthma. Maternal smoking and family (especially maternal) history of atopy appear to be risk factors for persistent sensitization and development of asthma. Indeed, exposure to tobacco smoke in utero significantly increases asthma risk and influences the timing of sensitization. It must be stated that any smoking at home has consequences for the development of asthma and other respiratory conditions. In addition, reports of possible protective effects of specific environmental conditions suggest that exposure to certain stimuli may reduce or block the development and progression of asthma. Attendance at a day care center early in life appears to offer protective effects against wheezing, as do early episodes of rhinitis, herpes, and measles. Children raised on a farm also have a decreased prevalence of atopic diseases. The protective effect of contact with livestock and poultry is consistent among several studies. Although the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved remain undefined, studies suggest that exposure to endotoxin and other components of bacteria may play an important role in protecting against childhood atopic diseases. Whether in utero exposure is beneficial remains to be determined.

N2  - The objectives of the present study were to quantify the association of atopy and respiratory infections with asthma, and exclusive breastfeeding with respiratory illness, atopy and asthma in children. A cohort study of 2,602 children enrolled prior to birth and followed prospectively, provided data on respiratory illness, the method of feeding in the first year of life, as reported on a prospective diary card, and current asthma at the age of 6 yrs (defined as doctor-diagnosed asthma with wheeze in the last year or cough without a cold, and currently taking either preventer or reliever asthma medication), as reported by parental questionnaire. Atopy was defined by a positive skin-prick test assessed at the age of 6 yrs. Wheezing lower respiratory illness (LRI) in the first year of life, particularly multiple episodes of wheezing LRI, increased the risk for current asthma in both nonatopic (odds ratio (OR) 4.10, p< or =0.0005) and atopic children (OR 9.00, p< or =0.0005), but did not increase the risk for atopy. In contrast, up to three upper respiratory tract infections demonstrated a negative association and four or more a positive risk for current asthma in unadjusted (p=0.006) and adjusted (p=0.057) analysis. Following adjustment, exclusive breastfeeding for <4 months was associated with an increased risk for current asthma (OR 1.36, 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.85, p=0.047). Wheezing lower respiratory illness in the first year of life and atopy are independently associated with increased risk for current asthma at the age of 6 yrs, suggesting that their effects are mediated via different causal pathways and that these risk factors are multiplicative when they operate concomitantly within individual children. Exclusive breastfeeding protects against asthma via effects on both these pathways, as well as through other as yet undefined mechanisms.

T1  - Racial and ethnic disparities in childhood asthma diagnosis: the role of clinical findings.
A1  - Roberts, Eric M
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - OBJECTIVES: To establish rates of childhood asthma symptoms, diagnosis, and hospitalization by race, ethnicity, and income, and to ascertain if elevated reported prevalence of asthma diagnosis among African-American children could be explained by differences in clinical findings., METHODS: Estimates of each indicator were calculated based on data from the third National Health and Nutrition and Examination Survey (NHANES III). Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were estimated to predict parent or guardian report of current asthma diagnosis., RESULTS: African-American children aged 1 to 5 have a 2-fold higher probability of both asthma diagnosis and hospitalization during the previous year but no significant difference in wheeze prevalence compared to Mexican-American and European-American children. These differences are not explained by household income or clinical information. Children aged 6 to 16 had similar rates of diagnosis and hospitalization for all racial/ethnic groups, although African-American children reported wheeze symptoms one-third less often., CONCLUSIONS: Although younger African-American children have higher morbidity from asthma than their Mexican-American and European-American peers, clinical findings were similar and did not explain increased rates of diagnosis. Interpersonal dynamics within families and communication between families and clinicians are believed to influence both symptom reporting and diagnosis generation.

N2  - Household and workplace exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is associated with various deleterious health effects. We evaluated the health impact of ETS in Italy. We considered only those health conditions for which systematic quantitative reviews were available. We used relative risks from the reviews while data on the proportion of the Italian population exposed to ETS were derived from national statistics or from ad hoc studies. A total of 2.033 newborns per year are of low birth weight (< 2500 grams) in Italy (7.9%) because of maternal exposure to ETS during pregnancy. There are 87 sudden infant deaths (16.9%) due to post natal maternal active smoking. 21.3% of acute respiratory infections during the first two years of life are due to parental smoking (about 77.000 children); 27.000 cases of asthma (9.1%), 48.000 cases of chronic respiratory symptoms, 64.000 cases of middle ear effusions among children and adolescents are due to parental smoking exposure. The annual estimates of mortality from lung cancer and ischemic heart disease due to ETS exposure from the spouse are 221 and 1896, respectively. Workplace exposure is associated with 324 lung cancer deaths and 235 deaths from ischemic heart disease. Although these estimate are based on several assumptions and they have large uncertainties, the results underline the need and the urgency of public health measures to reduce ETS exposure in the household and in the workplaces in Italy.

T1  - Interactions between respiratory tract infections and atopy in the aetiology of asthma.

Y1  - 2002//
N2  - The prevalence of asthma, in particular atopic asthma, has markedly increased in recent years. Accumulating evidence suggests that environmental factors associated with allergic sensitization and exposure to microbial stimuli during infancy and early childhood, are associated with these changes in prevalence. However, considerable controversy surrounds the role of microbial agents, as evidence has been presented for both positive and negative effects in this context. The review below focuses upon interactions between immune competence during infancy, the development of T-helper (Th)1-polarized versus Th2-polarized memory against inhalant allergens, and susceptibility to virus infection. In particular, recent finding are highlighted which suggest that delayed postnatal maturation of Th1 function is associated with increased risk for early postnatal sensitization to inhalant allergens, and also with risk for viral bronchiolitis during infancy. Variations in the kinetics of postnatal maturation of T-helper 1 function may in part be attributable to polymorphisms in the CD14 gene, which influence host responsiveness both to bacterial as well as viral stimuli.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that asthma is not invariably related to atopy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of atopy, asthma and sensitization to eight common allergens in a large group of children with allergic symptoms., METHODS: 1426 children referred to our Paediatric Asthma and Allergy Center because of allergic symptoms were examined. Bronchial asthma, allergic rhino-conjunctivitis, food allergy and atopic dermatitis were diagnosed with standardized methods. Atopy was diagnosed if at least one skin test was positive., RESULTS: Of the 1426 children examined, 629 (44%) were atopic and 769 (56%) were non-atopic. Asthma was diagnosed in the same proportion (i.e., 64%) of atopic and non-atopic children. However, after division into age groups, non-atopic asthma was significantly more prevalent (chi2 = 8.46) in children between 0 and 3 years old (group 1). On the other hand, atopy was significantly associated with asthma only in group 3 (odds ratio 1.85). Furthermore, a significant association with asthma symptoms was found for house dust mite (HDM) in group 3 (odds ratio 4.8)., CONCLUSIONS: Asthma is related to atopy in pre-selected children only from the age of 7 years. House dust mite sensitization seems to be an important determinant of asthma in these "older" children.

N2  - Two different socioeconomic groups of children with pneumonia were studied, and their clinical and demographic aspects were evaluated. The diagnosis of pneumonia was based on findings of cough and tachypnea, or on crackles on auscultation or on radiologically confirmed infiltrate. This was a prospective cross-sectional study conducted at the Professor Hosannah de Oliveira Pediatric Center, which cares for children of lower socioeconomic status (PHOPC), and at one private hospital which cares for children from middle to high socioeconomic status (Alianca Hospital, AH). Demographics and clinical differences were assessed by the Pearson chi-square test or Fisher's exact test as appropriate; means of continuous variables were compared by Mann-Whitney U-test. In a 26-month period, 3,431 cases were recruited. The 2,476 cases identified at the PHOPC were younger than the 955 identified at AH (2.2 +/- 2.3 vs. 4.5 +/- 3.1 years, P < 0.0001) and had higher scores for severity (3.5 +/- 1.5 vs. 2.7 +/- 1.7, P < 0.0001), duration of hospitalization (days) (10.9 +/- 12.1 vs. 6.2 +/- 7, P < 0.0001), frequency of tobacco smoker in the household (48% vs. 31%, P < 0.0001), cardiopathy (15.3% vs. 5.9%, P = 0.003), fever (44.4% vs. 36.3%, P = 0.0001), tachypnea (67.6% vs. 32.3%, P < 0.0001), crackles (69.5% vs. 64.9%, P = 0.02), somnolence (19.9% vs. 10.4%, P < 0.0001), malnutrition (13.7% vs. 5%, P < 0.0001), hospitalization rate (27.4% vs. 22.5%, P = 0.003), and death (0.9% vs. 0.1%, P = 0.009). However, other features were more frequent among AH cases: parent's university level of education (38.2% vs. 1.0%, P < 0.0001), underlying chronic illness (40.6% vs. 28.5%, P < 0.0001), asthma (62.7% vs. 50.8%, P = 0.01), rhinitis (9.2% vs. 0.4%, P < 0.0001), previous use of antibiotics (34.3% vs. 27.1%, P = 0.001), and wheezing (53.1% vs. 42.2%, P < 0.0001). Children of lower socioeconomic status have more serious lower respiratory tract disease, whereas children with pneumonia of middle to high socioeconomic status have more allergic diseases (rhinitis, asthma) and wheezing.

T1  - The association of childhood asthma with parental employment and welfare receipt.

A1  - Hatcher, Juliet L
A1  - Wertheimer, Richard
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: to assess the association of childhood asthma with parental employment and welfare receipt, which has not been studied., METHOD: We analyzed cross-sectional data on 13 371 children younger than 18 from the 1997 National Health Interview Survey, a nationally representative stratified probability sample of the US noninstitutionalized population. Single-parent (n=3,907) and 2-parent families (n=9,464) were analyzed separately. Families with children younger than 6 and families with incomes below the federal poverty level (FPL) were also analyzed separately. The main outcome measures were full-time parental employment and welfare receipt., RESULTS: Compared to single parents of nonasthmatic children younger than 6, single parents of young children with asthma were more likely to be employed less than full time (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.1, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-3.2). This relationship was also evident among single-parent families with incomes below FPL (adjusted OR 2.8, 95% CI, 1.2-6.5). Parental employment among 2-parent families with young children was similar regardless of child's asthma status. Two-parent families with young asthmatic children were more likely to have received welfare for at least 1 parent (adjusted OR 2.6, 95% CI, 1.5-4.6). Single-parent families of asthmatic children were also more likely to have received welfare (adjusted OR 1.4, 95% CI, 1.1-1.7)., CONCLUSION: Children's asthma is associated with reduced parental employment among single parents and increased welfare receipt among single- and 2-parent families. These associations with children's asthma may have implications for policy makers interested in increasing employment and decreasing welfare

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To provide national estimates of asthma prevalence in African-American, Mexican American and white (non-Latino) children and adolescents using several common definitions; to evaluate familial, sociodemographic, and environmental risk factors that are independently associated with current asthma in children; and to identify subgroups at particular risk for current asthma using 2 complementary data analytic approaches., DESIGN: Cross-sectional study, using the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988-1994., SETTING: Eighty-nine mobile examination centers in the United States., PARTICIPANTS: Twelve thousand three hundred eighty-eight African American, Mexican American, and white (non-Latino) children and adolescents, aged 2 months through 16 years, selected from a systematic random, population-based, nationally representative sample., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Current asthma, defined by caregivers who reported that their child currently had doctor-diagnosed asthma., RESULTS: The overall prevalence of current asthma was 6.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.6-7.8). Odds ratios for current asthma from the multiple regression analysis were 4.00 (95% CI, 2.90-5.52) for children with a parental history of asthma or hay fever, 1.94 (95% CI, 1.09-3.46) for children with body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) greater than or equal to the 85th percentile, and 1.64 (95% CI, 1.20-2.26) for children of African American ethnicity. African American and Mexican American children showed a consistent prevalence of current asthma across age while white children showed an increase in prevalence with age. The 2 highest-risk subgroups identified by the signal detection analysis were composed of children with a parental history of asthma or hay fever who were 10 years or older with a body mass index greater than or equal to the 85th percentile (31.0% current asthma), and children with a parental history who were 10 years or younger and of African American ethnicity (15.6% current asthma)., CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this analysis show a strong independent association between obesity and current asthma in children and adolescents, and confirm previous reports of a parental history of asthma or hay fever and African American ethnicity as additional important risk factors.

Y1  - 2002//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence, age distribution and common causes of chronic/recurrent cough in rural children., DESIGN: Prospective study., SETTING: Pediatric population in five villages of Dehlon Block of Ludhiana, Punjab., METHODS: 2275 children in the age group of 1 to 15 years were screened by house to house survey for chronic/recurrent cough using defined criteria. A detailed work up of selected cases was carried out. Underlying etiology was determined using clinical and laboratory parameters. Five hundred children in the study population formed the control group. Variables associated with chronic/recurrent cough were analyzed in cases and controls., RESULTS: Twenty four children were diagnosed with chronic/recurrent cough showing a prevalence rate of 1.06 percent. The most common cause was bronchial asthma (66.7 percent) followed by postnasal drip syndrome (25 percent). Family history of allergy/asthma was noted in 11 (45.8 percent) children as compared to 52 (10.4 percent) in the control group (p < 0.01). Family history of smoking was recorded in 16.7 percent of cases in contrast to 6.4 percent in controls (p = 0.05). There was no significant association with overcrowding, pets and kind of cooking fuel used., CONCLUSIONS: The most common cause of chronic/recurrent cough was bronchial asthma. There was a significant association with family history of allergy/asthma and smoking.

T1  - Epidemiology of asthma and recurrent wheeze in childhood.
A1  - Wright, Anne L
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - To summarize, wheeze is common throughout childhood, although it decreases as children age. However, the characteristics of wheeze, its relations with asthma, and its risk factors all change with age. Longitudinal studies have shown that "transient early wheezing" predominates during the first years of life. The principal risks for this type of wheezing are largely mechanical, relating to small airways, and infectious, relating to the risk of becoming infected with respiratory viruses. Associated with passive exposure to cigarette smoke, exposure to other children, and not being breastfed, this form of wheezing was unrelated to increased airway liability or atopy in the child. For the majority of children, particularly those with low lung function at birth, wheezing with early LRIs is a benign condition, not associated with subsequent wheeze or risk for asthma. During the middle part of the first decade of life, wheezing appears to reflect a mix of infectious and allergic wheezing. By 6 yr of age, some children have already wheezed persistently. This group is more likely to have high total IgE levels, to be skin-test positive, and to be given a diagnosis of asthma. Further, their immunologic response to their early LRIs was consistent with a Th2 bias: persistent wheezers produced high levels of IgE, and did not demonstrate the normal pattern of decreased eosinophils. Nevertheless, the children who wheeze in middle childhood are a mixed group, with some being less allergic. Thus, although markers of allergy become increasingly important predictors of wheezing for the group as a whole, wheezing in middle childhood is not associated with later methacholine hyperresponsiveness (42). Finally, persistent allergic wheezing, usually associated with a diagnosis of asthma, predominates by the end of the first decade of life. Wheezing at this age is associated with methacholine responsiveness, peak-flow variability, and markers of atopy, such as total IgE and allergy skin-test response. Although children who wheezed early in life are more likely to wheeze later, early wheeze does not increase the risk of atopy, suggesting that early LRIs are markers of increased risk rather than causes. The gender differences in wheeze disappear, with boys becoming less likely to wheeze and to have asthma, whereas both conditions appear to increase in girls. Finally, some of the risk factors for early LRIs, such as exposure to other children in infancy, appear to be associated with protection from later allergic wheezing. Clearly, asthma and wheeze during childhood are complex entities, presenting with different characteristics at different ages, and implicating varied and changing causes. Genetic factors are important determinants of the intermediate phenotypes. However, environmental factors operating at different developmental stages also appear to influence the development of asthma. Additional research regarding these relationships is essential, both to elucidate possible causal mechanisms and to provide insight into the primary prevention of asthma.

N2  - This study describes the natural history of atopic and wheezy disorders from birth to adult life in a cohort at risk of atopy. One hundred subjects born in Poole, England, were selected at birth in 1976 on the basis that at least one parent was atopic. Subjects were examined annually in the preschool years, and at the ages of 11 and 22 yr. Skin prick tests and total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) were performed at each visit, and at 11 and 22 yr, bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to inhaled histamine was measured. Sixty-three subjects remained on follow-up at 22 yr. The annual prevalence of both wheeze and atopy increased with age. Twenty-five percent of adults showed both wheeze and BHR (asthma). Remission of wheeze was common in subjects younger than 5 yr of age and likely if wheezing occurred on less than two occasions, but wheeze at 11 yr was likely to persist. Sixty percent of the adult subjects with asthma developed sensitivity to common allergens by the age of 2 yr and were showing BHR by mid-childhood. Sensitization to dietary allergens occurred in infancy and waned after early childhood but predicted the early sensitization to inhalant allergens. In conclusion, adults with asthma can begin wheezing at any age but tend to sensitize early and have abnormal airway characteristics by the age of 11 yr.

T1  - Natural history of asthma in children.
A1  - Amdekar, Y K
Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Asthma is a syndrome of reversible bronchial obstruction in hyperresponsive airways mediated by allergy or other trigger factors. Allergic disease represents true asthma while transient wheezing may be caused by factors such as viral infection, aspiration, prematurity and neonatal lung damage and is likely to outgrow within few years. Personal or family history of atopy, increased serum IgE and positive skin tests may suggest allergic asthma, which persists throughout life irrespective of presence or absence of symptoms. Onset of age beyond 2 years, severity, persistence or recurrence of symptoms beyond 6 years of age, airway hyperresponsiveness and abnormal lung function even in absence of symptoms, strong family history especially in the mother, exposure to allergens, parental smoking and delay in starting appropriate therapy are some of high risk factors in persistence of asthma in adult life. As outcome of asthma depend upon multiple variable factors, it is difficult to predict natural history of asthma in an individual child.

N2  - Residents near the Trecatti landfill site located in South Wales, United Kingdom, expressed concern about odors and health effects they attributed to site emissions. The authors compared routinely collected, population-based, health data from potentially exposed electoral wards (i.e., United Kingdom electoral tracts) with data from both wards nearby, matched for socioeconomic deprivation scores, and with wards where residents were likely to attend the same hospital. Mortality rates were higher for all causes and neoplastic diseases (but not respiratory disease) in the exposed wards, but there was no change in rates after the site opened. Hospital data revealed a transient increase in admissions for asthma during the 3 yr that preceded the peak in odor complaints. The birth prevalence of congenital malformations was raised in the exposed wards, but the authors could not exclude a possible artifact resulting from differences in reporting practices between hospitals. The absence of environmental monitoring in the community during the period of public concern was a significant weakness of this study.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationships among demographic characteristics, caregiver life stressors, and depressive symptoms of mothers and their children's asthma morbidity., SETTING: Three pediatric asthma subspecialty programs, 2 in the inner city and 1 in the suburbs., DESIGN: Cross-sectional census sample of caregivers of children with asthma: interviews mostly with mothers (N = 123) regarding their children's asthma symptoms and health care utilization. Information collected on demographics and caregivers' own recent life stressors and depressive symptoms., SUBJECTS: Caregivers of children ages 18 months to 12 years with asthma at their subspecialty visit., MEASURES: Structured interviews: a survey instrument prepared for this study and standardized instruments for depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies--Depression) and life stressors (Crisis in Family Systems)., RESULTS: A total of 32% of respondents' children had high asthma morbidity, 28% intermediate, and 40% low. Caregiver life stressors and depression and the children's sex showed the strongest relationships to asthma morbidity in a model that also included race, residence, and Medicaid status. Children were more likely to have high morbidity if they had caregivers with more depressive symptoms and negative life stressors and if they were female., CONCLUSIONS: Respondents experienced many life stressors and symptoms of depression while managing their children's illness. Caregivers' lives may affect their children's asthma morbidity, offering empirical evidence for the potential value of targeted case management for children in subspecialty care.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate individual factors associated with an asthma outbreak among children aged one to 14 years in Sydney in February 1999., METHODS: A case control study was undertaken with cases (n=92) defined as all children admitted to Sydney Children's Hospital for asthma in February 1999. Unmatched controls (n=76) were all children admitted for asthma in the previous three months. We obtained information by a structured telephone survey of parents. Logistic regression analyses were used to determine odds ratios for risk factors for hospital admission., RESULTS: Mean age for hospital admission of 4.7 years for cases and 4.4 years for controls. The presence of one or more siblings reduced the risk of admission during an asthma outbreak (OR=0.59, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.93). Children with older siblings aged 10 to 14 years were also less likely to be admitted (OR=0.3, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.74). An age effect was observed. Other demographic, clinical and environmental characteristics, including smoking, were not associated with admission during the outbreak., CONCLUSIONS: The main findings of this study are the protective effect of siblings and an age-dependent effect in risk of hospital admission during an asthma outbreak. These findings are consistent with an infective cause of the outbreak., IMPLICATIONS: Children without siblings, particularly older siblings, appear to be at highest risk of hospital admission during an asthma outbreak. Environmental and other factors need to be examined to further explain the episodicity of such outbreaks and to determine means of predicting and preventing future episodes.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Try to find out asthma incidence in urban population of Shenyang., METHOD: From December 1998 to June 1999, 24 176 residents (11 955 male and 12 221 female persons) living in two residential districts from an industrial and a cultural region were selected as subjects of epidemic investigation by random sampling. The subjects were asked questions concerning the epidemic investigation. The lung functions were measured for subjects suspicious for asthma., RESULTS: 299 cases (102 male and 197 female) were diagnosed as asthma. The incidence of asthma was 1.24% (male 0.85% and female 1.61%). The female incidence of asthma was significantly higher than that in male (P < 0.01). Of the asthma patients, 80 cases (26.76%) were found with heredity background in their families; and 73 cases (24.41%) were found complicated with COPD., CONCLUSION: The investigation basically reflected the true condition of asthma incidence in urban population of Shenyang.

N2  - In two German studies household wood or coal stove use was negatively associated with atopic sensitization and allergic rhinitis in childhood. Wood stove heating is strongly related to 'traditional lifestyle and therefore subjected to confounding factors possibly yet not known. The study was conducted to study these factors and the independent impact of early exposure to wood stove heating on subsequent asthma and atopic disease. In a questionnaire survey among 10667 Finnish university students aged 18-25 years, we investigated the association between wood stove heating at age 0-6 years and asthma and allergies up to young adulthood. Adjustment was made for factors related to the heating system and atopic disorders by using multivariate regression. Unadjusted lifetime prevalence rates for physician-diagnosed asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, atopic dermatitis and self-reported wheezing were lower among subjects with wood stove heating compared to other heating systems. There was a significant negative association between childhood wood stove heating and allergic rhinitis or conjunctivitis in the univariate model (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.61-0.91), but not for the other diseases. The significant association disappeared in the multivariate analysis after adjusting for various family indoor and outdoor (adjusted OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.77-1.20) factors. The association between wood stove heating and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis was mainly confounded by childhood residential environment, especially the farm environment. Farm environment was found to be the main confounding factor related to association between wood stove heating and asthma, and atopic diseases.

N2  - Japanese guideline for treatment and management of childhood asthma was published in April, 2000. This is the Japan original guideline. The general and practical asthma treatment in Japan is described. We compared with this guideline and GINA. There is not a difference in the diagnosis and concept of bronchial asthma. This guideline for several Japan original therapies are described. The originality of this guideline is the early use of theophylline. There is not the entry of the use of oral steroid. There are many Japan original therapies such as the isoproterenol continuous inhalation therapy. Also, as for this guideline the education, vaccination and exercise of the patient are written in detail. We hope that this guideline is translated to English and be published.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that pregnancy and early life may influence the development of asthma in the offspring, but published studies have not carefully controlled for potential biases., METHODS: In a large British birth cohort of 4065 natural children of 2583 mothers, we investigated whether in utero and perinatal influences contribute to the development and the severity of asthma in childhood, allowing for possible confounders of the relationship, and considering the nonindependence of familial data., RESULTS: Child asthma (10.1%) was more frequently reported by mothers when there had been health complications during pregnancy (prevalence =14.3%; adjusted odds ratio [ORadj] =2.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.52-2.67), labor, or delivery (19.3%, ORadj =1.35, 1.01-1.81); child illness or health complications during the first week of life (22.6%, ORadj =1.35, 1.01-1.82); and birth weight of < 2.5 kg (7.0%, ORadj =1.57, 1.10-2.25). Specific causes of health complications during pregnancy which significantly related to asthma were early or threatened labor (ICD: 644) (4.8%, ORadj =1.58, 1.03-2.40) and the malposition or malpresentation of the fetus (ICD: 652) (1.6%, ORadj =3.63, 1.47-8.91)., CONCLUSION: The results provide further evidence that in utero and perinatal factors may increase the risk of developing asthma.

T1  - Risk factors of childhood asthma: a Sri Lankan study.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - A case-control study was carried out to evaluate the genetic and environmental risk factors of childhood asthma in a group of Sri Lankan children. Three hundred cases (admitted with symptoms of asthma) and 300 age-matched controls were compared over a period of 23 months commencing in January 1996. Family history of atopy, feeding habits in infancy, bronchiolitis in infancy, passive smoking, exposure to dust and dampness, and exposure to pet animals were studied as risk factors for asthma. The risks associated with social factors were also studied. The risk associated with variables were calculated using the chi-squared test in the bivariate analysis and the forward logistic regression model in the multivariate analysis. Parental asthma, asthma in a sibling and in a relative, parental allergic rhinitis, discontinuation of breastfeeding after 6 months in infancy, bronchiolitis in infancy, living in a dusty environment, and a father with primary education compared to secondary education were independently associated with an increased risk of asthma (p < 0.05). This study reinforces the view that asthma has a multifactorial aetiology. Influence of paternal asthma is more than that of maternal asthma. As a preventive measure continuation of breastfeeding beyond 6 months is important.

N2  - In the study reported, the authors examined risk factors for repeated hospital admissions for asthma in a rural/suburban setting. Charts of patients who were hospitalized two or more times with the diagnosis of asthma between June 1991 and January 1998 were reviewed. A questionnaire was completed for each admission for 65 patients. The results demonstrated an equal male-to-female ratio, with a mean age of 27 years. Hispanics represented 12% of the patients although they accounted for only 2.5% of the general population in the area under study. The mean number of hospital admissions was 3.2. A history of depression existed in 25% of the patients. Noncompliance was admitted in 38%. Twenty-five percent were active tobacco smokers. Acknowledged triggers of asthma included viral infections (74%), exercise (50%), weather conditions (43%), dust (38%), cats (36%), sinusitis (32%), pollen (32%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (31%), dogs (30%), smoke (28%), and emotional stress (15%). Medications at time of admission included albuterol (98%), salmeterol xinafoate (26%), theophylline (38%), ipratropium bromide (55%), nedocromil sodium (20%), cromolyn sodium (35%), prednisone (49%), and inhaled corticosteroids (69%). Ninety-five percent had access to a primary care physician. Fifty-seven percent had a pulmonary and 11% had an allergy consult. These data suggest that patients in rural/suburban areas with repeated hospitalizations for asthma have a high probability of noncompliance, depression, and allergenic triggers. Gastroesophageal reflux was a common recognized trigger. Inhaled steroids were underused, whereas ipratropium and theophylline were overused. Bilingual education on asthma and triggers and social support are necessary even in rural healthcare settings without a large minority population.

N2  - To evaluate the relationship between bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) and the development of asthma in children with chronic cough, we performed methacholine inhalation challenges and transcutaneous oxygen pressure (tcPO2) measurements in 92 children with chronic cough aged from 1-13 years (55 boys and 37 girls; mean, 5.3 years) and followed them for > or = 10 years. Forty-four age-matched children with asthma (24 males and 20 females; mean, 6.5 years) and 44 age-matched children without cough or asthma served as controls (18 males and 26 females; mean, 4.6 years). Consecutive doubling doses of methacholine were inhaled until a 10% decrease in tcPO2 from baseline was observed. The cumulative dose of methacholine at the inflection point of the tcPO2 record (Dmin-PO2) was considered to represent hyperresponsiveness to inhaled methacholine. After 10 years or more of follow-up, 60 of the 92 subjects with cough answered our questionnaire, and 27/60 had been diagnosed with asthma. There was a statistical difference in Dmin-PO2 between the children who presented with chronic cough originally and who developed asthma (asthma-developed group) and those who did not develop asthma (asthma-free group). There was no difference in the value of Dmin-PO2 between the asthma-developed group and the asthma group, or between the asthma-free group and the age-matched control group. Among the children with chronic cough, there was no difference in Dmin-PO2 between girls and boys, either in the asthma-developed group or in the asthma-group. We conclude that 45% of the children with a chronic cough in early life developed asthma, and that BHR in children with chronic cough during the childhood period is a strong risk factor for the development of asthma.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the parameters which could predict the persistence of respiratory symptoms in asthmatic children who have been treated with a considerably uniform therapy., METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on the records of 279 children with asthma. An end of study visit, results of spirometry and prick tests completed the data. The mean age at referral and at final visit was 6.2 +/- 3.7 years and 8.9 +/- 4.1 years, respectively; and the children were followed up for a mean of 3 +/- 1.2 years., RESULTS: Eighty-five of the 279 patients (30%) experienced no respiratory symptoms in the previous 12 months. There was no significant difference between those with and without current respiratory symptoms with respect to age, sex, age at onset of symptoms, duration of followup, age at referral, therapeutic choice, severity of asthma and duration of symptoms at referral. For subjects with current respiratory symptoms the initial serum total IgE level, and the percentage of RAST/prick test positivity was significantly higher than those without current respiratory symptoms (P = 0.0027, P = 0.011, respectively). Although the initial FEF 25%-75%, FEV1, and FEV1/FVC was significantly lower in those with current respiratory symptoms (P = 0.003; P = 0.005; and P = 0.04, respectively), there was no statistically significant difference between lung functions of the two groups at the end of followup. The persistence of respiratory symptoms was significantly predicted by initial FEF25%-75% and sensitivity to allergens (P = 0.03 and P = 0.04, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the risk factors for the persistence of respiratory symptoms in our patient population have been low FEF25%-75% value and sensitivity to allergens at referral.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - The aim of the first national cross-sectional survey was to determine the prevalence of asthma-like respiratory symptoms and the associated risk factors among children aged 0-17 via interview with the parents by primary care physicians. They were selected through stratified two-stage cluster probability sampling in urban and rural parts of randomly selected 27 of 81 administrative districts in Turkey. Data was collected for 46,813 children (23,512 males and 23,301 females) of whom 66 percent resided in urban areas. The prevalence of physician-diagnosed asthma was 0.7 percent. The lifetime and current (last 12 months) prevalences were 14.7 percent and 2.8 percent for asthma, and 15.1 percent and 3.4 percent for wheezing respectively. The presence of personal atopy and history of family atopy were the most significant risk factors for current prevalences of wheezing, and asthma [adjusted Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were 6.2 (CI=4.0-9.5) and 1.8 (CI=1.3-2.4) for wheezing, and 8.5 (CI=5.6-12.9) and 1.9 (CI=1.4-2.5) for asthma, respectively]. Though there were no significant differences among those residing in urban versus rural areas regarding the current prevalences of asthma and wheezing, those living in coastal areas had considerably higher current prevalences than those inland (OR=2.6, CI=1.9-3.5 for wheezing, and OR=2.3, CI=1.7-3.1 for asthma). Residence in northern Turkey appeared to be a significant risk factor for wheezing (OR=1.9, CI=1.4-2.5), and children resident in southern Turkey exhibited the highest risk for occurrence of asthma (OR=1.5, CI=1.1-2.0) compared with eastern Turkey. In conclusion, the respiratory symptoms associated with asthma were an important cause of morbidity in childhood in Turkey. The discrepancy between prevalence of physician-diagnosed asthma and lifetime and/or current asthma prevalence figures may reflect the reluctancy of both physicians and parents to diagnose this condition. Besides strongest associations with personal atopy and atopic heredity, there were significant differences in prevalence rates between children residing in different regions, supporting the role of environmental factors.

N2  - The complex etiology of bronchial asthma (BA), one of the most common inflammatory diseases throughout the world, involves a combination of various genetic and environmental factors. A number of investigators have undertaken linkage and association studies to shed light on the genetic background of BA, but the genetic aspects of this disease are still poorly understood. In the course of a project to screen the entire human genome for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that might represent useful markers for large-scale association analyses of common diseases and pharmacogenetic traits, we identified six SNPs within the gene encoding I-kappaB-associated protein (IKAP), a regulator of the NF-kappaB signal pathway. Most of these SNPs were in linkage disequilibrium with each other. We observed a strong allelic association between BA in childhood and two of the SNP sites, T3214A (Cys1072Ser) and C3473T (Pro1158Leu); P = 0.000004 for T3214A and P = 0.0009 for C3473T. T3214A was also associated with BA in adult patients (P = 0.000002), but C3473T was not (P = 0.056). To confirm the above results, we compared estimated frequencies of haplotypes of the six SNPs between BA patients and controls. We found a strong association between BA in childhood and a specific haplotype, TGAAAT, that involved two amino-acid substitutions (819T, 2295G, 2446A, 2490A, 3214A, and 3473T; P = 0.00004, odds ratio, 2.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.48-3.4). On the other hand, haplotype TACGTC, which differed from the TGAAAT haplotype in the last five nucleotides, was inversely correlated with the BA phenotype (P = 0.002; odds ratio, 9.83; 95% CI, 8.35-11.31). These results indicated that specific variants of the IKAP gene, or a variant in linkage disequilibrium with the TGAAAT haplotype, might be associated with mechanisms responsible for early-onset BA.

N2  - The authors investigated the effects of ambient air pollution on hospital admissions in Brisbane, Australia. The authors used the Air Pollution on Health: European Approach protocol to examine the effects of particles, ozone, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide on daily hospital admissions for asthma and respiratory, cardiovascular, and digestive disorders (control diagnosis) that occurred during the period 1987-1994. Ozone was consistently associated with admissions for asthma and respiratory disease-with little evidence of a threshold. In two-pollutant models, the ozone effect was relatively unaffected by the control for high levels of other pollutants. Particulate pollution (measured by nephelometry) was associated positively with admissions for respiratory disease and admissions for asthma in summer, whereas a negative association was observed for cardiovascular admissions. Although sulfur dioxide was associated significantly with admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular disese, a significant association was also found for the control diagnosis of digestive disorders. No significant associations were found for nitrogen dioxide over the study period, although significantly positive seasonal interactions were found for asthma and respiratory disease in autumn, winter, and spring. It was concluded that current levels of ambient air pollution in Brisbane make a significant contribution to the variation in daily hospital admissions for asthma and respiratory disease.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Our objective was to use a causal model for childhood asthma to determine whether the effect of day care attendance on asthma was mediated by recurrent respiratory tract infections., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study is based on a cross-sectional survey among 1,447 children aged 6-16 years in Oslo. Their parents completed written questionnaires. A recursive logit model was used to estimate direct effects in terms of adjusted odds ratios (aOR)., RESULTS: Year of birth, number of siblings and length of maternal education were significantly associated with after-school care attendance. Attendance increased the risk of early infections, aOR = 1.8 (1.3-2.5), and infections were associated with asthma, aOR = 4.9 (3.4-7.3). The crude association between after-school care and asthma was cOR = 1.5 (1.0-2.2), whereas the estimated direct effect was small and non-significant, aOR = 1.2 (0.8-1.9). The results may be influenced by over-reporting of infections among parents with children with asthma., INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that children who attend day care have an increased risk of asthma, with early infections as a mediator of risk.

N2  - A retrospective survey was undertaken of children with difficult asthma, attending a respiratory clinic. The clinical and laboratory profiles of asthmatic children who were poorly controlled on > or = 800 microg of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) were studied and compared to children well-controlled on > or = 800 microg ICS. Assessments were made of atopy, growth, lung function, treatment adherence, home environment, and responsiveness to corticosteroids (CS). Fiftyseven "difficult" and 23 well-controlled children were studied. Significant differences in the home environment were identified. Smoking was significantly more common in the difficult-to-control group. Nine children had alternative diagnoses. Poor CS responsiveness was present in 10 children. Adverse home environments, poor treatment supervision, alternative diagnoses, and unresponsiveness to CS were the most important factors in difficult asthma. A full assessment, including bronchoscopy, is indicated to avoid unnecessary increases in CS to doses that could cause side-effects.

T1  - Effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy and environmental tobacco smoke on asthma and wheezing in children.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - The effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy and childhood environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure on asthma and wheezing were investigated in 5,762 school-aged children residing in 12 Southern California communities. Responses to a self- administered questionnaire completed by parents of 4th, 7th, and 10th grade students were used to ascertain children with wheezing or physician-diagnosed asthma. Lifetime household exposures to tobacco smoke were assessed using responses about past and current smoking histories of household members and any history of maternal smoking during pregnancy. Logistic regression models were fitted to cross-sectional data to estimate the effects of in utero exposure to maternal smoking and previous and current ETS exposure on the prevalence of wheezing and physician-diagnosed asthma. In utero exposure to maternal smoking without subsequent postnatal ETS exposure was associated with increased prevalence of physician-diagnosed asthma (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.9), asthma with current symptoms (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.3 to 4.0), asthma requiring medication use in the previous 12 mo (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.6), lifetime history of wheezing (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.6), current wheezing with colds (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.4) and without colds (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4 to 4.4), persistent wheezing (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.6 to 6.1), wheezing with exercise (OR, 2.4; 95% CI; 1.3 to 4.3), attacks of wheezing causing shortness of breath (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3 to 4.4) or awakening at night in the previous 12 mo (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.7 to 5.8), and wheezing requiring medication (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.7) or emergency room visits during the previous year (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.4 to 7.8). In contrast, current and previous ETS exposure was not associated with asthma prevalence, but was consistently associated with subcategories of wheezing. Current ETS exposure was associated with lifetime wheezing (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.5), current wheezing with colds (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3 to 2.0) and without colds (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.9), wheezing with exercise (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3 to 2.2), attacks of wheezing causing shortness of breath (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.1) or awakening at night (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.0), and wheezing requiring medication (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.8) or emergency room visits within the previous year (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.0). The effects of current ETS exposure on subcategories of wheezing were most pronounced among children exposed to two or more smokers and remained significant after adjusting for maternal smoking during pregnancy. We conclude that maternal smoking during pregnancy increases the occurrence of physician-diagnosed asthma and wheezing during childhood. In contrast, current ETS exposure is associated with wheezing, but not physician-diagnosed asthma. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that ETS operates as a cofactor with other insults such as intercurrent infections as a trigger of wheezing attacks, rather than as a factor that induces asthma, whereas in utero exposure acts to increase physician-diagnosed asthma

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Although asthma in children constitutes a major health problem, there is a dearth of literature on different aspects of asthma in rapidly developing countries. This cross-sectional research aims to study the socioclinical profile of asthmatic children and the impact of asthma symptoms on their life style., METHODS: The sample of this study, drawn from pediatric clinics of a general hospital and primary health care centers during a period of six months, comprised of children under 13 years of age who met the operational diagnostic criteria for asthma. The data collected from multiple sources on a semistructured questionnaire was analyzed by using different statistical tests., RESULTS: The results showed that male children represented 69% of the sample and children under one year of age manifested significantly severe degree of asthma. The frequency of asthma symptoms decreased in most of the studied children with increasing age. Further, they have insignificant family history of asthma (48.5%) but a significant smoking at home in severely affected children (59%). Moreover, most of them (88%) were mainly characterized by a combination of asthmatic symptoms of variable severity that adversely affected their sleep pattern and significantly resulted in school absences and increased days stay in hospital., CONCLUSION: The revealed socioclinical profile of studied children with asthma has adverse impact on certain components of their life style, which shows the need for re-activating relevant treatment modalities including health education and changing certain habits like parental smoking at home, which adversely affects asthma.

N2  - We performed this study with the aims of describing the trend of asthma-related mortality in Italy between 1980 and 1994, and to evaluate the relationship between sale estimates of beta2-agonists drugs and mortality from asthma. For asthma mortality we used data provided by National Institute of Statistics, for sale estimates of beta2-agonists we used data provided by IMS HEALTH. We calculated the gender specific age-standardized incidence rates of asthma-related deaths for all ages and for age classes. We found that estimates for asthma-related mortality steadily increased between 1980 and 1987 in both sexes, and thereafter decreased. In people, aged between 34 and 64 and over 64, death rates in males were significantly higher than in females while the rates in those aged less than 34, were mostly similar in both gender. The overall exposure to beta2-agonists (alone and in combination) increased from 1980 to 1990, remained stable between 1990 and 1993, and increased steeply in 1994. We conclude that asthma-related death rates have declined since the mid-1980's. This decline has been more pronounced in males and in the older ages, while the rates in younger patients of both genders have remained nearly unchanged. Our data do not substantiate the hypothesis of an increased risk of asthma-related mortality associated to the use of inhaled beta2-agonists in general nor fenoterol or salbutamol in particular.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for pediatric asthma emergency department (ED) visits. A cross-sectional sample of 307 families (24%) responded to a mailed survey. Respondents were similar to the target population of 2487 children with asthma. Thirty-seven percent of respondents had two or more asthma ED visits in the past year. Asthma ED use was associated with persistent asthma symptoms, parents without high school diplomas, age under 4 years, African-American race/ethnicity, use of written care plans, and use of spacers at school. The latter two variables were associated with severe asthma. High-risk children can be targeted for office-based medical care.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Allergic diseases are more prevalent in affluent countries, which has been attributed to life-style factors. Life-style habits may also differ between socioeconomic (SES) classes. The objective of this paper therefore was to evaluate if SES had an impact on the development of atopic disorders., METHODS: A total of 1314 German children were followed-up in an observational birth cohort study to 6 years of age. Parents filled in questionnaires, and had multi-allergen screening tests for sensitization. Indoor allergen concentrations were determined by ELISA. Children were examined regularly up to 6 years, specific serum IgE values were determined by CAP-Rast-Feia., RESULTS: The risk of aeroallergen sensitization (odds ratio 1.76; 95% CI 1.30-2.37), and the lifetime prevalence of hay fever (2.36; 1.76-3.17), and asthma (1.74; 1.08-2.80), but not of atopic dermatitis (AD: 0.90; 0. 54-1.51) was elevated in parents of high compared to low SES. With high SES the risk of smoking in pregnancy (0.35; 0.23-0.51), in the home (0.31; 0.21-0.46), pet ownership (0.37; 0.26-0.55), high mite (0.42; 0.25-0.74), and high cat (0.38; 0.18-0.82) allergen concentration in house dust was reduced, but elevated for breastfeeding over more than 6 months (4.67; 2.9-7.48). In children, even after controlling for other risk factors, only the risk of AD from 3 to 6 years (2.42; 1.42-4.14) was elevated in families with high SES, but not of AD in infancy or of any other atopic disorder., CONCLUSIONS: While parents of high SES have a higher prevalence of inhalative allergies, their favourable life-style prevents the development of atopic disorders in their children, except for AD beyond infancy.

T1  - Daycare attendance, asthma and atopy.
A1  - Nystad, W
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - The objective of this article is to review studies that have examined the relation of daycare to asthma and atopy. In order to identify studies for inclusion, abstracts of all studies referenced in Medline from January 1966 to January 2000 and in BIBSYS were searched and extracted if they included 'asthma' or 'atopy' combined with words such as 'daycare', 'nursery' or 'kindergarten'. Eight studies fulfilled the criteria of inclusion. The outcomes were asthma, skin prick test (SPT) reactivity, a positive radioallergosorbent test (RAST), hay fever, and eczema. Daycare attendance was positively associated with asthma in five of six studies including asthma. In three of these studies there was no statistically significant association between daycare and asthma. Early start in daycare protected against later asthma in one study. There was a weak, but not a statistically significant positive relation between daycare and atopy in two of three studies when SPT reactivity was used as the outcome. In children of small families early start in daycare protected against atopy. The quality of the studies varies, and they are not directly comparable. The relation between daycare attendance and asthma and atopy is unclear, and further studies designed to answer this specific research question are needed.

N2  - The Child Health Supplement to the 1988 National Health Interview Survey was used to examine parent-reported current asthma among a nationally representative sample of 17,110 children zero to 17 yr of age. Numerous demographic variables were analyzed for independent associations with asthma using modified stepwise logistic regression, with models including specific combinations of risk factors. Black children had higher rates of asthma than did white children in unadjusted analyses, but after controlling for multiple factors, black race was not a significant correlate of asthma (adjusted odds ratio = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.63 to 1.21). Compared with nonurban white children, urban children, both black and white, were at significantly increased risk of asthma: urban and black (adjusted OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.14 to 1.86), urban and white (adjusted OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.48), whereas nonurban black children were not: nonurban and black (adjusted OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 0.83 to 1.61). Similarly, compared with nonurban, nonpoor children, urban and poor (adjusted OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.05 to 1.95), urban and nonpoor (adjusted OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.004 to 1.48), urban children, both poor and nonpoor, were at significantly increased risk of asthma, whereas nonurban poor children were not: nonurban and poor (adjusted OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.72 to 1.48). These results suggest that the higher prevalence of asthma among black children is not due to race or to low income per se, and that all children living in an urban setting are at increased risk for asthma.

N2  - Data of the literature over the last 20 years indicate that infantile asthma, although heterogeneous, often appears following RSV bronchiotitis, especially when sufficiently severe to justify hospitalisation. The risk of developing episodes of wheezing (bronchial obstruction syndrome) over the following 2 to 3 years is higher than 50%, but estimations vary according to the authors. Functional disturbances (pulmonary distension, nonspecific bronchial hypperreactivity, hypoxia), with or without associated clinical symptoms, may be observed several months to several years after hospitalisation for bronchiolitis. On the other hand, mild bronchiolitis, and most of the recurrent expiratory obstructive syndromes with asymptomatic free intervals between episodes do not appear to carry a risk of functional sequelae. Children suffering from severe bronchiolitis usually develop a severe bronchial obstruction syndrome. In asthma, the percentage of IgE-dependent sensitization is less than 20% before the age of 4 years. The presence of positive skin tests and/or specific serum IgE directed against the usual allergens are associated with the persistence of asthma during the childhood. Similarly, the appearance of wheezing after the age of 3 years (or recurrence after this age) is associated with the persistence of asthma. Prospective studies of cohorts followed since birth show that pre-existing functional abnormalities can promote the appearance of bronchiolitis and bronchial obstruction syndrome. Asthma in infants comprises several phenotypes with very different prognoses.

T1  - Lethal or life-threatening allergic reactions to food.
A1  - Wuthrich, B
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Fatal or life-threatening anaphylactic reactions to food occur in infants, children and adults. Atopic individuals with bronchial asthma and prior allergic reactions to the same food are at a particularly high risk, whereby even the mere inhalation of the allergenic food can be fatal. Not only peanuts, seafood and milk can induce severe, potentially lethal anaphylaxis, but indeed a wide spectrum of foods, according to the different patterns of food sensitivity in different countries. Foods with "hidden" allergens and meals at restaurants are particularly dangerous for patients with food allergies. Similarly, schools, public places and restaurants are the major places of risk. However, the main factor contributing to a fatal outcome is the fact that the victims did not carry their emergency kit with adrenaline (epinephrine) with them. In cases of death where food anaphylaxis is suspected, it is important for forensic reasons to preserve uneaten portions of the food in order to identify (hidden) allergens. It is also important to determine postmortem specific serum IgE, tryptase and histamine levels to document the anaphylaxis. There is a need to raise awareness of the diagnosis and treatment of anaphylaxis among doctors, those called upon to administer emergency medical care, and the public, and also to provide increased support for those with potentially fatal food allergies through the help of patients' organizations, and national and international medical societies. The food industry should ensure a policy of comprehensive labelling of ingredients so that even the smallest amount of potentially lethal foodstuffs can be clearly identified. Finally, the pharmaceutical industry should be persuaded to reintroduce an adrenaline inhaler onto the market.

T1  - Breastfeeding and asthma in children: findings from a West Australian study.
A1  - Oddy, W H
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - The primary aim was to determine whether there was an inverse association between the duration of exclusive breastfeeding and the development of traits associated with asthma in children at age six years. A prospective cohort study of children from Western Australia was enrolled prior to birth and followed to age six. Two thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine children were recruited through antenatal clinics at the major tertiary obstetric hospital in Perth. Unconditional logistic regression was used to model the association between duration of exclusive breastfeeding and outcomes related to asthma or atopy at age six allowing for a number of important confounders. These included gender, gestational age, smoking in pregnancy and early child care. After adjustment for confounders, the introduction of milk other than breastmilk before four months of age was a significant (p < 0.05) risk factor for all asthma-related outcomes in six-year-old children: (i) doctor diagnosed asthma odds ratio OR = 1.25 (95% CI 1.02-1.54); (ii) wheeze three or more times since the age of one year OR 1.42 (1.15-1.76); (iii) wheeze in the last twelve months OR 1.28 (1.02-1.76); (iv) sleep disturbance due to wheeze within the last twelve months OR 1.41 (1.04-1.90); (v) age at doctor diagnosis (hazard ratio HR 1.22 1.03-1.43); (vi) age at first wheeze (HR 1.36 1.17-1.59) and; (vii) positive reaction to common aeroallergens OR 1.27 (1.01-1.59). There is a substantial reduction in risk of childhood asthma as assessed at age six years, if exclusive breastfeeding is continued for at least the first four months of life. These findings are important for our understanding of the aetiology of and for the potential prevention of asthma in children.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Allergic asthma is a common childhood disease. Although T-lymphocyte activation plays a critical role in allergic asthma, the environmental factors promoting lymphocyte activation in children are not well defined., OBJECTIVE: In a cohort of children at risk for asthma (n = 114), we determined whether the levels of cockroach (Bla g 1 or 2), house dust mite (Der f 1), and cat allergen (Fel d 1) in the home during infancy was associated with subsequent allergen-specific lymphocyte proliferation in later life., METHODS: Dust samples from multiple sites in the home were collected at 3 months of age and were measured for allergen levels. Serial questionnaires were applied. At a median age of 2 years, PBMCs were isolated and lymphocyte proliferation to the home allergens and PHA was determined., RESULTS: Increased lymphocyte proliferative responses to Bla g 2 were associated with higher home levels of Bla g 1 or 2 (P for trend with kitchen Bla g levels =.011), in analyses adjusting for cold in the past week. Proliferative responses to Der f 1 were higher in homes with family room levels of Der f 1 > or =10 microg/g dust than in homes with Der f 1 <2 microg/g, but differences were not significant in analyses adjusting for cold (P =. 15). Repeated wheeze in the first 2 years of life was associated with increased allergen-specific and PHA proliferative responses., CONCLUSION: Early-life cockroach allergen exposure at 3 months of age predicts allergen-specific lymphocyte proliferative responses at a median of 2 years of age.

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - We previously reported an increased risk for bronchial obstructive disease and allergic sensitization up to age 3 in 47 children hospitalized with a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis in infancy compared with 93 matched control subjects recruited during infancy. The aims of the present study were to evaluate the occurrences of bronchial obstructive disease and allergic sensitization in these children at age 7(1)/ (2). All 140 children reported for the follow-up, which included physical examination, skin prick tests, and serum IgE tests for common food and inhaled allergens. The cumulative prevalence of asthma was 30% in the RSV group and 3% in the control group (p < 0.001), and the cumulative prevalence of "any wheezing" was 68% and 34%, respectively (p < 0.001). Asthma during the year prior to follow-up was seen in 23% of the RSV children and 2% in the control subjects (p < 0.001). Allergic sensitization was found in 41% of the RSV children and 22% of the control subjects (p = 0.039). Multivariate evaluation of possible risk factors for asthma and sensitization using a stepwise logistic statistical procedure for all 140 children showed that RSV bronchiolitis had the highest independent risk ratio for asthma (OR: 12.7, 95% CI 3.4 to 47.1) and a significantly elevated independent risk ratio for allergic sensitization (OR: 2.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 5.5). In conclusion, RSV bronchiolitis in infancy severe enough to cause hospitalization was highly associatied with the development of asthma and allergic sensitization up to age 7(1)/ (2). The results support the theory that the RSV influences the mechanisms involved in the development of asthma and allergy in children.

T1  - Effects of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis or tetanus vaccination on allergies and allergy-related respiratory symptoms among children and adolescents in the United States.

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Findings from animal and human studies confirm that diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis (DTP) and tetanus vaccinations induce allergic responses; associations between childhood vaccinations and subsequent allergies have been reported recently., OBJECTIVE: The association of DTP or tetanus vaccination with allergies and allergy-related respiratory symptoms among children and adolescents in the United States was assessed., METHODS: Data were used from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey on infants aged 2 months through adolescents aged 16 years. DTP or tetanus vaccination, lifetime allergy history, and allergy symptoms in the past 12 months were based on parental or guardian recall. Logistic regression modeling was performed to estimate the effects of DTP or tetanus vaccination on each allergy., RESULTS: The odds of having a history of asthma was twice as great among vaccinated subjects than among unvaccinated subjects (adjusted odds ratio, 2.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.59 to 6.74). The odds of having had any allergy-related respiratory symptom in the past 12 months was 63% greater among vaccinated subjects than unvaccinated subjects (adjusted odds ratio, 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.05 to 2.54). The associations between vaccination and subsequent allergies and symptoms were greatest among children aged 5 through 10 years., CONCLUSIONS: DTP or tetanus vaccination appears to increase the risk of allergies and related respiratory symptoms in children and adolescents. Although it is unlikely that these results are entirely because of any sources of bias, the small number of unvaccinated subjects and the study design limit our ability to make firm causal inferences about the true magnitude of effect.

T1  - Pathophysiology of asthma.
A1  - McDowell, K M
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Asthma is a complex, multifactorial disease. Although airway reactivity, inflammation, and increased mucus secretion are agreed on universally as the central components of asthma, the pathophysiology of each of these is complex. This Article reviews the physiologic events resulting in symptoms of asthma. The contributions of genetics and environment to the development of the asthma phenotype are discussed. Gastroesophageal reflux and environmental allergies are prevalent conditions in asthmatic patients and often act as significant triggers for asthma symptoms.

N2  - Wheezing in infants and children presents a difficult differential diagnosis contingent on the presenting symptoms and age of the child. A determination of the anatomy of the lower airway, combined with allergic, infectious, and noninfectious irritants, is requisite to a complete evaluation. The intervention strategies to decrease wheezing and bronchial hyperresponsiveness may include both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management. The nonpharmacologic management of asthma in children is contingent on aggressive treatment of dietary protein sensitivity and strict environmental control. The treatment of bronchial hyperresponsiveness with pharmacologic intervention in infants and children is relegated to the optimal use of sodium cromoglycate and inhaled corticosteroid.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of passive smoking and breastfeeding on the severity and age of onset of bronchial asthma., DESIGN: Cross-sectional study., SETTING: Paediatric observation ward and paediatric chest clinic, Kenyatta National Hospital., PATIENTS: Children aged between one and 120 months., RESULTS: More than fifty per cent of the children had their first wheeze at less than 12 months of age and 68% were categorised as having moderate to severe asthma. Passive smoking was positively significantly associated with early onset of wheezing (chi 2 = 6.22, p = 0.012, Odds ratio = 2.44, 95% CI 1.2,5.0), and also, at a non significant level, to severity of asthma (chi 2 = 2.8, p = 0.09, Odds ratio = 2.1, 95% CI 0.9,4.7). On the other hand, exclusive breastfeeding was significantly negatively associated with severity of bronchial asthma (chi 2 = 4.02, p = 0.045, Odds ratio = 0.4, 95% CI 0.14,0.98), but did not seen to have effect on age of onset of the disease (chi 2 = 0.0006, p = 0.94, Odds ratio = 0.9, 95% CI 0.4,2.2)., CONCLUSION: Passive smoking is associated with early onset of asthma and possibly with development of severe asthma while exclusive breastfeeding is protective against development of severe asthma but does not seem to affect the age of onset of this disease.

The prevalence rate of the first and the second degree relatives of proband was significally higher than that of the controls. The segregation ration of asthma was 0.14 (95% CL 0.098-0.18). The h2 of the first and second degree relatives of asthma were 78.18% and 55.02%, of which 83.64% for female and 73.48% for male., CONCLUSION: The genetic model of asthma belonged to polygenetics. Genetic fastor was a main risk fastor for asthma, especially for female patients.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to know the prevalence of physician-diagnosed asthma and related epidemiological variable among children between 0 and 13 years of age in Asturias (Spain)., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A population based prevalence study was performed. A team of 44 researches evaluated the clinical records of children living in 24 different healthcare zones of Asturias. The total number of children included in the study was 27,511. Asthma during the infant period (0-23 months) and preschool age (2-5 years) was defined according to clinical criteria and asthma during school age (6-13 years) was established according to clinical criteria and pulmonary function. Prevalence of physician-diagnosed asthma following these criteria, sex and age-class distribution and the prevalence of current asthma (presenting symptoms during the previous 12 months) were studied. The study is dated as of January 1, 1998., RESULTS: The child sample included in this study represents 23.9% of the Asturian pediatric population. Asthma was diagnosed in a total of 3,170 children, of these 243 were infants, 915 preschoolers and 2,012 were of school age. Asthma prevalence calculated over the whole pediatric population was 11.5% with a breakdown by age groups of 7.6% for infants, 13.5% for preschoolers and 11.5% for school age children. Of all asthmatic children, 73.3% were symptomatic during the previous year. Males represented 61.5% of all asthmatic children., CONCLUSIONS: 1. Asthma prevalence is high with this illness being the number one health problem in children in Asturias. 2. The highest percentage of children suffering from asthma experienced symptoms during the previous year. 3. A predominance of this disease in males was confirmed.

N2  - The Epidemiological study on the Genetics and Environment of Asthma (EGEA) was planned to assess genetic, environmental risk factors and their interactions for asthma and for the two related traits of bronchial hyperresponsiveness and atopy. The population examined includes 348 nuclear families ascertained by one asthmatic (213 adult and 135 paediatric probands) and 416 controls, totalling 1,847 subjects (EGEA I). Prevalences of asthma, skin prick test response, high IgE and bronchial hyperresponsiveness were for parents, siblings, and offspring of cases intermediate between cases and spouses or controls, both in adults and children, confirming the familial resemblance for asthma and related traits. With an additional sample of 40 families ascertained by two asthmatic siblings (EGEA II), a total of 119 families with two asthmatic siblings has been ascertained for a genome screening.

N2  - Wheezing in childhood is not a single disorder and different wheezing-associated respiratory illnesses have been recently described. We investigated the association between wheezing conditions and familial, pre-, peri-, and postnatal risk factors. We studied 16,333 children, 6 to 7 yr old, enrolled in a population-based study. Standardized questionnaires were filled in by parents. A total of 1,221 children had transient early wheezing, 671 had persistent wheezing, 918 had late-onset wheezing, and 13,523 never had wheezing or asthma (control group). Maternal asthma or chronic obstructive airway disease were significantly (p < 0.0001) more associated with persistent wheezing than with transient early and late-onset wheezing. The same pattern was observed for exposure to maternal smoke during pregnancy. Having a mother > 35 yr old was protective against transient early wheezing (odds ratio [OR]: 0.68, 95% confidence intervals [95% CI]: 0.53 to 0.86). Breast feeding >/= 6 mo was slightly protective against transient early wheezing (OR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.68 to 0.97), whereas it was a moderate risk factor for late-onset wheezing (OR: 1.22, 95% CI: 0.99 to 1.50). On the contrary, having siblings and attending a day care center were both risk factors for transient early wheezing (OR: 1.41 [95% CI: 1.21 to 1.64] and 1.70 [95% CI: 1.48 to 1.96], respectively) and protective factors against wheezing of late onset (OR: 0.83 [95% CI: 0.70 to 0.97] and 0.72 [95% CI: 0.59 to 0.88]). There was a stronger (p < 0.0001) positive association between personal history of eczema or allergic rhinitis and persistent and late-onset wheezing than transient early wheezing. Our findings suggest a different contribution of risk factors to wheezing conditions in childhood.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The relation between lower respiratory tract illnesses in early life caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and the subsequent development of wheezing and atopy in childhood is not well understood. We studied this relation in children who had lower respiratory tract illnesses that occurred before 3 years of age., METHODS: Children were enrolled at birth and cases of lower respiratory tract illness were ascertained by a physician. Viral tests were done for specimens collected at the time of the illness. Children were classified into five groups according to type and cause of lower respiratory tract illness. Children were then followed prospectively up to age 13, and we measured frequency of wheezing, pulmonary function, and atopic status (allergy skin-prick tests, serum IgE concentrations)., FINDINGS: RSV lower respiratory tract illnesses were associated with an increased risk of infrequent wheeze (odds ratio 3.2 [95% CI 2.0-5.0], p < 0.001), and an increased risk of frequent wheeze (4.3 [2.2-8.7], p < or = 0.001) by age 6. Risk decreased markedly with age and was not significant by age 13. There was no association between RSV lower respiratory tract illnesses and subsequent atopic status. RSV lower respiratory tract illnesses were associated with significantly lower measurements of forced expiratory volume (2.11 [2.05-2.15], p < or = 0.001) when compared with those of children with no lower respiratory tract illnesses, but there was no difference in forced expiratory volume after inhalation of salbutamol., INTERPRETATION: RSV lower respiratory tract illnesses in early childhood are an independent risk factor for the subsequent development of wheezing up to age 11 years but not at age 13. This association is not caused by an increased risk of allergic sensitisation.

T1  - Epidemiologic evidence of increased airway reactivity in children with a history of bronchiolitis.
A1  - Kattan, M
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Airway hyper-responsiveness, or hyper-reactivity, can be identified on clinical evaluation in a number of ways, including a history of wheezing, physician-diagnosed asthma, or the bronchial response to challenge with nonspecific stimuli such as methacholine or histamine. However, wheezing and the responses to these stimuli are not uniform within or across individuals, and in the general population there is a wide range of bronchial responsiveness that follows a normal distribution. Airway hyper-reactivity occurs in a number of settings, including acute viral bronchiolitis. Some, but not all, studies of children years after hospitalization during infancy for respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis or another lower respiratory tract infection demonstrate the presence of airway hyper-responsiveness. In contrast, infants studied who are <12 months of age do not have airway hyper-responsiveness after episodes of bronchiolitis. Discrepancies in the study results may reflect the bronchial challenge procedure used and the pulmonary function studies performed. Viral lower respiratory tract infections might alter immune responses to favor immunoglobulin E production, but the results of studies relating respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis with subsequent immunoglobulin E production again have been discrepant. Host and environmental factors such as exposure to tobacco smoke or a family history of atopy may be more important than viral lower respiratory tract infections as determinants of bronchial reactivity.

A1  - Garcia Martinez, J M
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Morbidity and mortality derived from asthma continue to be a main public health problem in many countries, in spite of the advances in the knowledge on the disease and its treatment. There are several risk factors for asthma attack which have to be considered in the management of patients in order to prevent exacerbations and mortality. Smooth bronchial muscle constriction and inflammation with oedema of the bronchial wall are the facts that cause airway flow and resistance disturbances, with hyperinflation, leading to a bigger respiratory work. On the other hand, the bronchial obstruction leads to a ventilation-perfusion disequilibrium and hypoxia. At the beginning of the process there is hypocarbia, but when the attack progresses muscle fatigue happens, and retention of CO2, being a sing of alarm (predictive of respiratory failure) a normal and rising PaCO2. The evaluation of an acute asthmatic patient should accomplish a clinical and objective assessment (peak flow rate and saturation of O2), in order to classify the crisis in: mild, moderate or severe. Managing acute asthmatic patient includes: oxygen, bronchodilator ss2 agonists at high and even continuous doses and systemic corticosteroids to prevent the progression and to control inflammation. These procedures should be promptly instituted. Although there is less evidence on their beneficial effects other measures as intravenous aminophylline, nebulized anticholynergics, magnesium sulphate and intravenous ss2 agonists may be used when the conventional therapy is not quickly successful and the patient is in a critical situation, at a real risk of respiratory failure, and in order to avoid mechanical ventilation. If this is finally instituted, controlled hypoventilation with permissive hypercarbia is now recommended, to avoid barotrauma, which used to be a frequent complication when more aggressive attitude was the rule. Interaction between paralytic agents and corticosteroids may produce a miopathy, so the recommendation now is to try not to use paralytic agents, even with profound sedation of needed. Sixty four patients were treated on 77 occasions in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of our hospital. They were 0,5 to 13,9 years old, being 50% less than 5 years old. It was the first attack in 9 (14%) patients. The standard management consisted of oxygen, frequently or continuously nebulized salbutamol and intravenous methylprednisolone (1 to 6 mg/kg/day). Furthermore nebulized ipratropium bromide was administered 58 times (75%), as well as intravenous aminophylline 69 (89%), intravenous salbutamol 23 (30%), magnesium sulphate 16 (21%) and ketamine 10 (13%). Antibiotics were given 22 times (29%). Two 15 month old infants received mechanical ventilation in three occasions, and relevant complications happened (pneumothorax and myopathy, and pneumomediastinum and bronchiolitis obliterans respectively). Fifty six patients have been followed for a period of 3 to 110 months (median 48 months), and 16 (29%) have needed high doses (equal to or move than 800 mcg of budesonide or equivalent). There are data on lung function in 36 of them, FEV1 is normal (> 85% of predicted, between 86 and 127) in 26 (78%) and < 85% (65 to 84%) of predicted in 8 (22%) FEV1 rises more than 15% (16 to 23%) in four patients after the inhalation of a ss2 agonist. Inhaled anesthetic agents and heliox have been used in some pediatric cases. After a severe asthma attack the strategy of management should be reviewed, as well as the possible risk factors.

Improved hygiene, smaller families, altered exposure to allergens have been suggested., OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship between exposure to pets in early life, family size, allergic manifestations and allergic sensitization at 7-9 and 12-13 years of age., METHODS: The prevalence of allergic diseases and various background factors were assessed in 1991 and 1996 by questionnaire studies. In 1991, the study comprised representative samples of children from the Goteborg area on the Swedish west coast (7 years old, n = 1649) and the inland town Kiruna in northern Sweden (7-9 years old, n = 832). In 1992, a validation interview and skin prick test (SPT) were performed in a stratified sub-sample of 412 children. In 1996, this subgroup was followed up with identical questions about clinical symptoms as in 1991, detailed questions about early pet exposure were added and SPT performed., RESULTS: Children exposed to pets during the first year of life had a lower frequency of allergic rhinitis at 7-9 years of age and of asthma at 12-13 years. Children exposed to cat during the first year of life were less often SPT positive to cat at 12-13 years. The results were similar when those children were excluded, whose parents had actively decided against pet keeping during infancy because of allergy in the family. There was a negative correlation between the number of siblings and development of asthma and allergic rhinitis., CONCLUSION: Pet exposure during the first year of life and increasing number of siblings were both associated with a lower prevalence of allergic rhinitis and asthma in school children.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to describe gender differences in children's health until the age of 7 y. The study cohort consisted of all children born in Finland in 1987 (n = 60254), of whom 99.9% were identified in the follow-up. Childhood health data were received from five national registers (1987-94), from regional registers of intellectual disabilities (1987-96) and from education registers in the largest county (1996). Boys had a 20% higher risk for a low 5-min Apgar score and an 11% higher risk for being preterm. After the perinatal period, boys had a 64% higher cumulative incidence of asthma, a 43% higher cumulative incidence of intellectual disability, a 22% higher incidence of mortality and a higher, but not statistically significant, incidence of epilepsy and vision disorders. No male excess was found for diabetes or hearing disorders. The healthcare-related indicators showed poorer health for boys, who had a 37% higher mean of hospital days, a 28% higher risk for receiving social benefits due to health problems and a 13% higher risk for long-term medication. The differences in the socially defined indicators were greatest, and boys had a two- to three-fold risk of having delayed development, postponed school start or attendance in special education programmes. Gender differences in different social classes were similar. Boys' shorter gestational age at birth did not explain the gender differences in childhood health. Some of boys' poorer health seemed to be biologically based, but the social causes of health problems are amenable to change. In particular, the potential of the school system to reduce ill health among boys should be investigated.

N2  - PURPOSE: To compare the rates of perioperative morbidity of patients with sickle cell anemia who were randomly assigned to 2 preoperative transfusion regimens and to identify predisposing factors for perioperative complications., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Investigators at 36 centers enrolled 118 patients who were scheduled to have elective surgery and agreed to randomization between 2 preoperative transfusion regimens. Forty-seven subjects were enrolled but not randomized, including 20 who were not transfused before surgery. Perioperative management was based on a prescribed care plan., RESULTS: Tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy (TA) were performed on 136 persons, and 29 had myringotomy as their primary procedure. There were no differences in the frequency of complications between the randomized groups. The serious, non-transfusion complication rates for randomized patients were 32% (34 of 107) for TA and 36% (4 of 11) for myringotomy. A history of pulmonary disease was a predictor of postoperative sickle cell-related events for patients undergoing TA surgery., CONCLUSIONS: The more intensive transfusion regimen did not result in fewer perioperative complications. The high frequency of complications emphasizes the need for anticipatory management of persons undergoing TA. A history of pulmonary disease identifies patients at increased risk for sickle cell-related events after TA surgery. Patients undergoing myringotomy have a low frequency of sickle cell-related events but a significant frequency of other serious perioperative complications.

N2  - Allergic disease and pollution effects on children are a subject of worldwide concern. Outdoor pollution is the sum of acid particle (SO2, NO2, PM) and photochemical (ozone) pollution. Experimental studies demonstrated correlation between animals and humans concerning inhalation of pollutants and inflammatory and functional effects. Several studies among children confirmed with variable odds ratios the interaction between air pollution and respiratory health, but other studies showed no clear effect. Physicians should inform parents with children experiencing respiratory disease.

N2  - Environmental tobacco smoke interacts with the respiratory mucosa by irritation and/or inflammation. Environmental tobacco smoke seems also modulate humoral and cellular immune activity. Thus, environmental tobacco smoke, in all children, increases the risk of superior and inferior airway infections, modifies the growth and the natural evolution of the respiratory function, increases the occurrence of asthma and exacerbates the symptoms of asthma, and creates or exacerbates a bronchial hyperresponsiveness. In atopic children (defined by the presence of at least one positive allergy skin test), environmental tobacco smoke increases the risk of respiratory allergy and exacerbates the symptoms of respiratory allergy. Parental environmental tobacco smoke is a universal toxic which must be avoided in both allergic and non-allergic children.

N2  - Viral respiratory tract infections are a major cause of wheezing in infants. Investigators determined that 80% to 85% of school-aged children with wheezing episodes were tested positive for virus. To more fully understand how viral respiratory tract infections influence asthma, investigators have evaluated the effect of respiratory tract infections on airway symptoms, function, and inflammation. Although the mechanisms by which respiratory viruses enhance lower airway inflammation are not established, cytokines may play a key role in this process. The respiratory epithelial cell is a principal host for respiratory virus replication and is likely to be the first source of cytokines during an acute infection. T cells orchestrate immune responses to both allergens and viruses, and regulate effector cells with virucidal and proinflammatory effects. Although studies demonstrate that virus-specific T cells may contribute to virus-induced lung disease, evidence to define the role of virus-specific T lymphocytes in asthma has not been fully established. Some infections early in life may also have an important immunoregulary role in the subsequent development of allergy and asthma. Atopy is characterised by exaggerated Th-2 cell responses to common allergens with secretion of cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-5 that promote IgE production and eosinophil activation. In contrast, childhood infections typically induce a Th-1 cell response, characterised by secretion of interferon-gamma, which enhances the antiviral activities of effector cells. These two types of T cell responses are mutually antagonistic.

N2  - Epidemiology of paediatric respiratory allergic disorders allows the approach to causal and preventive risk factors by studying groups or sub groups of children in different locations and under different conditions. This is, however, complicated by the lack of consensus on disease definitions, which renders comparisons between studies difficult. Atopy is usually defined by the presence of positive skin tests (wheal size of at least a mean diameter > or = 3 mm), by the presence of specific IgE, or by the presence of increased total IgE (> or = 100 UI/mL). Infantile asthma is not well defined, complicated by the high prevalence of bronchiolitis; one thus questions between wheezing or wheezy bronchitis. Prevalence is high: among early wheezers, two populations will be defined by the medium term evolution: transient wheezers and persistent wheezers. Risk factors for these two conditions are different. Childhood asthma may be defined by the diagnosis of asthma (specific but fairly non-sensitive), by asthmatic symptoms (wheezing, waking by an attack of shortness of breath) (sensitive but not very specific), or by the combination of symptoms and airway hyperresponsiveness. The ISAAC study has standardised a questionnaire to assess the prevalence of asthma. The preliminary results show that there are wide variations across the world. The prevalence is low in Africa and Asia, intermediate in Europe, and high in Anglo-Saxon countries. The prevalence of asthma has gradually increased over the past 20 years in developed countries. Asthma and atopy are closely associated in children. Risk factors are genetic, associated with sex and environmental factors. Among these, allergic sensitisation is associated with the degree of exposure to allergens. Westernization of way of life is associated with increased prevalence of atopy, allergic rhinitis and asthma. Atopy seems inversely correlated to certain infections. Passive smoking is clearly associated with early wheezing. This and atmospheric pollution aggravate childhood asthma. However, the inducing role of pollution on asthma is still controversial.

T1  - Changing prevalence of allergic rhinitis and asthma.
A1  - Sly, R M
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: This review will enable the reader to discuss prevalence, risk factors, and prognosis of allergic rhinitis and asthma., DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (PubMed) search using the terms allergic rhinitis, asthma, prevalence, risk factors., STUDY SELECTION: Human studies published in the English language since 1978, especially studies of relatively large populations in the United States, Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand, with cross referencing to earlier relevant studies., RESULTS: Current prevalence of allergic rhinitis at 16 years of age in cohorts of British children born in 1958 and 1970 increased from 12% in the earlier cohort to 23% and in the later cohort. Local surveys of allergic rhinitis at approximately 18 years of age in the United States in 1962 to 1965 disclosed prevalence of 15% to 28%, while the national survey of 1976 to 1980 disclosed a prevalence of 26%. Thus, it is uncertain whether prevalence of allergic rhinitis has changed in the United States based on these limited data. Data from several sources indicate worldwide increases in prevalence of asthma. Annual Health Interview surveys indicate increases in prevalence of asthma in the United States from 3.1% in 1980 to 5.4% in 1994, but prevalence among impoverished inner city children has been much higher. Combined prevalence of diagnosed and undiagnosed asthma among inner city children has been 26% and 27% at 9 to 12 years of age in Detroit and San Diego. Positive family history and allergy are important risk factors for allergic rhinitis and asthma. Prognosis is guarded; allergic rhinitis resolves in only 10% to 20% of children within 10 years, and at least 25% of young adults who have had asthma during early childhood are symptomatic as adults., CONCLUSION: Increases in prevalence remain unexplained, but avoidance of recognized allergens should reduce the prevalence of allergic rhinitis and asthma.

N2  - Early childhood bronchial asthma is defined on a clinical basis as the occurrence of at least three episodes of wheeze before 2 years of age, once excluded a chronic obstructive lung disease, mainly cystic fibrosis. Recent birth cohort studies (Tucson, Wight island) showed that approximately 40% of early childhood asthma remain symptomatic in later childhood. Thus in any young child with asthma the question is raised of its significance, ie transient bronchial hyper-reactivity or first manifestations of a chronic asthma. At the present time, there is no specific marker which may clearly differentiate between these two opposite evolutions, and the evidence for an atopic predisposition remains the best predictive criteria for persistent asthma. This justifies preventive measures directed towards environmental protection of the at risk young child: mainly passive smoking and allergen avoidance.

N2  - Atopic dermatitis is an extremely common condition whose prevalence is on the increasing for the past three decades particularly in North Europe, where it affects 15% of children, since birth to seventh year. A simultaneous increase of atopic respiratory disorders such as asthma and allergic rhinitis has been reported. Clinical diagnostic criteria of atopic dermatitis are well known and the recent studies concern particularly the interactions between genetic and environmental provocative factors, such as house dust mites, maternal smoking and food allergens. In susceptible families, the maternal and infants avoidance of these triggers may allow to decrease the incidence or the severity of atopic dermatitis. The conventional treatment remains symptomatic with topical steroids. However, the better understanding of pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis holds the hope of immunomodulating treatment, particularly in refractory cases.

T1  - Evolution of asthma through childhood.
A1  - Sears, M R
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - The greatest incidence of childhood asthma is among males under 5 years, with decreasing numbers of new cases with age. Many young children wheeze, but remission is common especially in non-atopic children without a family history of allergy or asthma, whose wheezing relates more to infections and environmental tobacco smoke exposure. The prognosis of childhood asthma is best established from population studies, in which some two-thirds of wheezy children become symptom-free as adults, whereas follow-up studies of wheezing children seen in office or specialty clinic practice, who generally have more severe asthma, show a much greater likelihood (60-80%) of persistence of asthma into adulthood. Factors predisposing to persistence of childhood asthma include a positive family history, development of atopy, environmental exposures to allergens and cigarette smoke, markers of severity of childhood asthma, and female gender.

T1  - The rising trends in asthma and allergic disease.
A1  - von Mutius, E
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Considerable variation in the prevalence of childhood asthma and allergic conditions has been shown in previous studies. These differences may in part be attributable to methodological problems in defining childhood asthma and wheezing illnesses. However, the results of recent surveys using identical study instruments suggest that the variation in the distribution of the disease is real. In western societies serial prevalence studies have furthermore shown an increasing trend in the prevalence of childhood asthma and airway hyperresponsiveness. A concomitant increase in the prevalence of hay fever and atopic eczema has been reported by others. Moreover, hospitalization rates for childhood wheezing illnesses have increased in affluent countries suggesting that indeed the morbidity from these causes has increased in the last decades. Interestingly, areas of low prevalence of asthma and atopic conditions have recently been identified in developing countries and in Eastern Europe. In Eastern Germany where drastic changes towards westernization of living conditions have occurred after reunification an increase in the prevalence of hay fever and atopic sensitization has been documented over the last 4-5 years in children aged between 9 and 10 years of age. The prevalence of asthma and airway hyperresponsiveness, however, remained virtually unchanged in this age group. These children spent their first 3 years of life under socialist living conditions and were exposed to a western lifestyle only after their third birthday. Therefore, environmental factors may affect an individual's inherited susceptibility for the development of asthma and hay fever at different ages inducing changes in the prevalence of atopic diseases in populations in a time- and age-dependent way.

T1  - Predicting readmission to hospital with asthma.
A1  - Raymond, D

A1  - Coory, M
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether readmission to hospital for children aged 1-7 years with asthma can be predicted; and to discover whether factors related to the severity of the attack and past pattern of asthma, assessment of the parents' intention to treat the child with inhaled therapy, perceived consequences of treatment, habits of treatment and self-efficacy show a difference between those children subsequently readmitted and those who were not., METHODS: A specifically developed questionnaire was administered to parents of 121 children admitted with asthma. Clinical assessment was made of severity of the acute attack and past pattern of the asthma. One year after admission subjects were reviewed to determine those who had been readmitted., RESULTS: On univariate analysis, the negative perceived consequences of treatment with inhaled therapy were associated with an increased risk of readmission over a one-year period (P = 0.04). After adjusting for confounders (place of birth of mother, two- or one-parent family) and the effect-modifier of past pattern of the asthma (infrequent episodic, frequent episodic, persistent), the greater the negative perceived consequences of treatment, the more likely there would be readmission in children with infrequent episodic asthma. After adjusting for potential confounders, using logistic regression a decrease of one standard deviation in the negative perceived consequences score resulted in a one-third decrease in the odds of readmission (odds ratio (OR) = 0.31, 95% CI 0.12-0.83)., CONCLUSIONS: Parents whose children are readmitted see greater negative perceived consequences of treatment. If asthma is infrequent episodic, the negative perceived consequences may be an inhibitor of treatment, whereas for more severe past patterns of asthma the severity is the controller of treatment. If parental negative consequences could be decreased, admissions for asthma may decrease.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This article describes trends in the prevalence of asthma among children aged 0 to 14 from 1978/79 to 1994/95, and in hospital separations for asthma from 1974/75 to 1994/95. It also examines factors associated with childhood asthma., DATA SOURCES: Information on asthma among children aged 0 to 11 is from the 1994/95 National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY), and among children aged 12 to 14, from the 1994/95 National Population Health Survey (NPHS). Hospital separation data are from the Hospital Morbidity File. Mortality data are from the Canadian Vital Statistics Data Base., ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES: Prevalence estimates of asthma were calculated based on a sample of 22,831 children aged 0 to 11 from the NLSCY and 637 children aged 12 to 14 from the NPHS. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of asthma among children aged 0 to 11 by selected characteristics., MAIN RESULTS: The prevalence of childhood asthma and hospital separations rates for asthma have increased sharply. A history of bronchitis and allergies, parental asthma, and residence in the Atlantic provinces and Quebec are associated with higher rates of asthma in children.

A1  - Lee, B W
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - This study examined the healthcare utilization patterns for asthma in Singapore, a tropical island city-state, between 1986 and 1993. Asthma was ranked fifth among principal conditions with the highest number of discharges in Singapore (2.4 discharges per 1,000 population per annum). Among the 0-14 year-olds, asthma was ranked second, only after accidents and injuries, as the condition with the highest number of discharges (5.2 per 1,000). It was estimated that there were approximately 20,000 accident and emergency (A & E) room visits for asthma per annum (7.0 visits per 1,000 population per annum). There were, however, no significant changes in the number of hospitalized or emergency room cases for asthma over the period of analysis. In the primary healthcare setting, asthma ranked 6th among the leading conditions seen by the general practitioners and government polyclinics (15 visits per 100 population per annum). Among under 15 year olds, asthma (37 visits per 100 age-adjusted population per annum) ranked as the second leading condition behind upper respiratory tract infections. This study has shown that asthma causes a significant amount of morbidity in the Singapore community.

N2  - BACKGROUND: It is not sufficient to predict 'high allergic risk newborns' on the basis of increased IgE concentrations of cord blood alone, because a raised cord blood IgE concentration is specific but not sensitive in the prediction of the development of allergic disorders. Warner et al. have reported that interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) production by allergen-triggered cord blood cells is a predictor of atopic eczema, based on the 1-year follow-up study., OBJECTIVE: We examined whether IFN-gamma production by antigen-stimulated cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) is a risk factor of allergic disorders, based on the 6-year follow-up study., METHODS: The relationships among cord blood IgE concentrations, IFN-gamma and interleukin-2 (IL-2) productions by antigen-stimulated CBMCs, and the development of allergic disorders in 21 infants for 6 years were investigated., RESULTS: Atopic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis, or atopic dermatitis and bronchial asthma developed in seven of 21 subjects. The maximal IFN-gamma concentration in culture supernatants of ovalbumin (OA) or bovine serum albumin (BSA) stimulated CBMCs in infants who developed allergic disorders was significantly lower (P < 0.01) than that in infants who did not develop any allergic disorders. In contrast, the maximal IL-2 concentration in culture supernatants of OA- or BSA-stimulated CBMCs in infants who developed allergic disorders was not lower than in infants who did not develop any allergic disorders. Moreover, the IFN-gamma concentrations were negatively correlated with cord blood IgE concentrations., CONCLUSION: Reduced IFN-gamma production by antigen-stimulated CBMCs is a risk factor of allergic disorders.

N2  - Cohort studies, which are longitudinal studies that follow a group of people with reference to the development of disease, have been a cornerstone of research on childhood asthma. These studies are uniquely suited to address questions concerning the incidence of illness, the natural history of disease, and the sequence of events linking exposures with outcomes. Three findings from on-going cohort studies are particularly relevant for the design of future intervention studies. First, most childhood asthma begins in infancy, with 80% of children who develop asthma having their first episode of wheeze before the age of 3 yrs. Second, events in early life, possibly including allergen exposure, infant feeding practices and viral infections, may be critical to the development of asthma in childhood. Finally, wheezing presents as separate phenotypes at different ages, with each phenotype having distinct characteristics, risk factors and prognoses. Additional cohort studies are required to determine to what extent events occurring in infancy, both viral and allergic, trigger expression of asthma, what are the mechanisms whereby they foster development of the disease, and whether their effect can be prevented.

N2  - There is now convincing evidence that childhood asthma is a spectrum of different conditions that are manifested by recurrent symptoms of bronchial obstruction. Risk factors such as age, genetic background, degree of maturation at birth and allergic sensitization, amongst others, are important in determining asthma-like manifestations at different times during childhood. Although efforts have been made to differentiate "wheezing syndromes" occurring during childhood, these efforts have been made more difficult by the significant degree of overlap between them. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that recurrent obstructive symptoms remit in a large number of children who develop these symptoms during the first 3 yrs of life, and low lung function seems to be the main risk factor for these transient episodes. On the other hand, children who will go on to develop persistent wheezing beyond infancy and early childhood usually have a family history of asthma and allergies and present with allergic symptoms very early in life. Recent studies suggest that the latter also show acute immune responses to viruses that are different from those of transient wheezers. Identification of specific inflammatory markers for persistent wheezing at the time of the first lower respiratory symptoms may be a necessary step for the establishment of successful strategies for the prevention of asthma in the future.

N2  - The prevalence of atopic dermatitis and other allergic diseases is increasing in industrialized countries. Today we know that atopy is conditioned genetically, but the development of the atopic phenotype requires environmental factors. It is believed that the genetic factors have not changed and that the increased prevalence is due to the increase in exposure to allergenic and non-specific environmental factors. The potential for sensitization is greater in the early years of life, so it is necessary to reduce harmful environmental exposure at these ages. Atopic clinical manifestations develop sequentially, in many cases beginning with atopic dermatitis in the early months of life. We know that children with atopic dermatitis present non-specific bronchial hyperreactivity (58 to 82%), which is a risk factor for the later development of asthma. The presence of specific bronchial hyperreactivity for mites in atopic dermatitis with mite sensitization also has been described, and it has been demonstrated that signs of eczema can develop or become exacerbated by airway exposure during bronchial challenge tests. The evolution from atopic dermatitis to asthma is a possibility that must be kept in mind. Patients should be followed-up and study of hyperreactivity and sensitization to allergens should be carried out in order to prevent the development of clinical symptoms. Prevention should include pneumoallergens, food allergens, and non-specific environmental risk factors, such as parental smoking (particularly mothers), pollution inside and outside the home, etc. Prevention is particularly important in children at risk of allergy, as determined by a family history among first-degree relatives, as well as the presence of atopic dermatitis, particularly of early onset, because these patient are most at risk of developing bronchial asthma in later years. At present, pharmacological prevention is being studied, without overlooking environmental prevention, in children at high risk of atopic disease for the purpose of preventing chronic inflammations that will condition their future as adults. In our daily clinical experience, atopic dermatitis is responsible for 8% of visits to a pediatric allergology unit. We emphasize that 62.5% of our patients with dermatitis are referred when they already have bronchial asthma, which represents an important delay in diagnosis with respect to the onset of symptoms.

N2  - Recent epidemics of acute asthma have caused speculation that, if their causes were known, early warnings might be feasible. In particular, some epidemics seemed to be associated with thunderstorms. We wondered what risk factors predicting epidemics could be identified. Daily asthma admissions counts during 1987-1994, for two age groups (0-14 yrs and > or = 15 yrs), were measured using the Hospital Episodes System (HES). Epidemics were defined as combinations of date, age group and English Regional Health Authority (RHA) with exceptionally high asthma admission counts compared to the predictions of a log-linear autoregression model. They were compared with control days 1 week before and afterwards, regarding seven meteorological variables and 5 day average pollen counts for four species. Fifty six asthma epidemics were identified. The mean density of sferics (lightning flashes), temperature and rainfall on epidemic days were greater than those on control days. High sferics densities were overrepresented in epidemics. Simultaneously high sferics and grass pollen further increased the probability of an epidemic, but only to 15% (95% confidence interval 2-45%). Two thirds of epidemics were not preceded by thunderstorms. Thunderstorms and high grass pollen levels precede asthma epidemics more often than expected by chance. However, most epidemics are not associated with thunderstorms or unusual weather conditions, and most thunderstorms, even following high grass pollen levels, do not precede epidemics. An early warning system based on the indicators examined here would, therefore, detect few epidemics and generate an unacceptably high rate of false alarms.

N2  - Effective management of populations with asthma requires methods for identifying patients at high risk for adverse outcomes. The aim of this study was to develop and validate prediction models that used computerized utilization data from a large health-maintenance organization (HMO) to predict asthma-related hospitalization and emergency department (ED) visits. In this retrospective cohort design with split-sample validation, variables from the baseline year were used to predict asthma-related adverse outcomes during the follow-up year for 16,520 children with asthma-related utilization. In proportional-hazard models, having filled an oral steroid prescription (relative risk [RR]: 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3 to 2.8) or having been hospitalized (RR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.1 to 2.7) during the prior 6 mo, and not having a personal physician listed on the computer (RR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.1 to 2.3) were associated with increased risk of future hospitalization. Classification trees identified previous hospitalization and ED visits, six or more beta-agonist inhalers (units) during the prior 6 mo, and three or more physicians prescribing asthma medications during the prior 6 mo as predictors. The classification trees performed similarly to proportional-hazards models, and identified patients who had a threefold greater risk of hospitalization and a twofold greater risk of ED visits than the average patient. We conclude that computer-based prediction models can identify children at high risk for adverse asthma outcomes, and may be useful in population-based efforts to improve asthma management.

N2  - A follow-up study was undertaken to determine the predictors of the course of recurrent wheezing episodes in children (between 0 to 8 years). In 1991, 600 children with wheezing episodes had been recorded by physicians who participated in a sentinel practice network. On each consultation with the same physicians from October 1994 until June 1995, parents of these children were questioned again about the course of their respiratory symptoms (n = 218). Associations between the course of disease and predictors (recorded by physicians in 1991) were analysed using polytomous logistic regression. The following factors were significantly associated with the frequency of asthmatic episodes (odds ratio (OR) > 1 indicates an unfavourable course of disease in comparison with the reference category, [95% confidence interval]): indoor cigarette smoking: OR = 1.7; [1.0-3.0], older than 1 year of age (reference: < 1 year): OR = 3.0; [1.1-8.5], more than 5 asthmatic episodes during the year before the first registration: OR = 2.7; [1.3-5.6], infect-associated asthma: OR = 0.4 [0.2-1.0], paediatrician as recording physician (reference: general practitioner): OR = 0.4 (0.2-0.8). No significant association with the course of disease was found for sex, education of the parents, region, parental asthma, hospital admissions because of obstructive symptoms. In correspondence with other studies, the majority of children showed a favourable course of their obstructive respiratory symptoms: for only 7% the frequency of episodes increased during 3 years after the first contact. Indoor smoking and severity of asthma are known as predictors of the course of the disease. The better prognosis of infect-associated obstructive symptoms supports the thesis that the majority of infants with asthmatic symptoms have narrow, infect-mediated airways obstructions, but no increased risk for bronchial asthma in their later lives. An early identification of children at risk may allow a specific and intensified therapy to improve the course of disease.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Recent work has suggested possible linkages between perinatal factors and notably, head circumference and risks of subsequent atopic illness., OBJECTIVE: To examine the linkages between perinatal factors and risks of atopic conditions in a birth cohort of New Zealand children studied to the age of 16., METHODS: Measures of atopic illness including asthma, eczema, and other allergies were assessed prospectively during the course of a 16 year longitudinal study of a birth cohort of 1265 New Zealand children. In the initial stage of this research, measures of perinatal variables including birthweight, gestational age, head circumference and length at birth were obtained from hospital record data., RESULTS: Children with head circumference at birth of 37 cm or greater had (unadjusted) odds of asthma that were 1.8 (P < 0.01) to 3.0 (P < 0.0001) times higher than the odds for children of lesser head circumference. However, risks of asthma were not related to other perinatal measures including birthweight, gestational age or length or ratios of these measures. There were no consistent associations between perinatal measures and other measures of childhood atopy including eczema, allergic rhinitis and other allergies. The associations between head circumference and asthma risks persisted when due allowance was made for potentially confounding social and perinatal factors., CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that large head circumference at birth may be associated with increased risks for the development of asthma. Possible explanations for the linkages between head circumference and asthma risks are considered.

N2  - The Christchurch Health and Development Study comprises 1,265 children born in 1977. The 23 children who received no diphtheria/pertussis/tetanus (DPT) and polio immunizations had no recorded asthma episodes or consultations for asthma or other allergic illness before age 10 years; in the immunized children, 23.1% had asthma episodes, 22.5% asthma consultations, and 30.0% consultations for other allergic illness. Similar differences were observed at ages 5 and 16 years. These findings do not appear to be due to differential use of health services (although this possibility cannot be excluded) or con-founding by ethnicity, socioeconomic status, parental atopy, or parental smoking.

T1  - Definition of pediatric asthma and associated risk factors.
A1  - Martinez, F D
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - Significant advances have been made in recent years in understanding the different ways in which asthma is expressed during childhood. There is a large group of children (20% of the population) who present with wheezing during viral infections during the first 3 years of life but whose symptoms disappear after this age. These children do not have any of the important risk factors associated with asthma in later childhood (high serum IgE levels, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, family history of asthma). The main characteristic associated with this condition is reduced lung function, which can be detected before these illnesses develop. It has been suggested that there is nothing unusual or characteristic in the immune response to viruses in these children, but it would appear that these children have narrower intrapulmonary airways. A second group of young children (10% of the population), who also wheeze during viral infections, present with most of the risk factors associated with asthma in later childhood. In this group of children symptoms tend to persist with age. It appears that in these children the immune response to viruses is characterized by a predominance of TH2-like cells. This suggests that their early wheezing is the expression of asthma because a TH2-like response to allergens and viruses is a characteristic found in most asthmatic children. A better understanding of the different types of childhood asthma, together with development of accurate prognostic tests, may be decisive in determining adequate strategies for prevention and treatment of the condition.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Asthma and allergy in developing countries may be associated with adoption of an urbanised "western" lifestyle. We compared the rates of asthma symptoms and atopy in urban populations in Jimma, southwest Ethiopia, at an early stage of economic development with those among the population of remote, rural, subsistence areas, and assessed the potential role of environmental aetiological factors leading to the differences., METHODS: Information on wheeze of 12 months' duration, diagnosed asthma, and cough for 3 months of the year was gathered by questionnaire in random household samples of 9844 people from urban Jimma and of 3032 from rural areas. Atopy was defined by allergen skin-test response to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and mixed threshings measured in a one-in-four subsample of those aged 5 years and older from both groups., FINDINGS: All respiratory symptoms were rare in children and were significantly less common overall in the rural than in urban group (wheeze odds ratio 0.31 [95% CI 0.22-0.43], p < 0.0001). Asthma was reported by 351 (3.6%) of the urban group, with a median reported duration of 8.5 years (IQR 4-17 years) that was unrelated to age. Atopy was a strong risk factor for asthma in urban Jimma. In the rural areas, skin sensitivity to mixed threshings was only slightly less common than in urban Jimma (0.67 [0.40-1.12], p = 0.13), whereas sensitivity to D pteronyssinus was significantly more common (3.24 [2.40-4.38], p < 0.0001), and since none of the 119 atopic individuals in the rural area reported wheeze or asthma, atopy was possibly associated with a reduction in the risk of disease among this group. Wheeze or D pteronyssinus sensitivity were positively associated with housing style, bedding materials, and use of malathion insecticide, but no single factor accounted for the urban-rural differences., INTERPRETATION: Wheeze and asthma are especially rare in rural subsistence areas, and atopy may be associated with a reduced prevalence of these symptoms in this environment. In urban Jimma, self-reported asthma seemed to emerge as a clinical problem about 10 years before our study began, which is consistent with an effect of new environmental exposures. The factor or factors leading to the increase in asthma and allergy have not been identified, although exposures related to general changes in the domestic environment are likely to be involved.

N2  - UNLABELLED: All hospital treatment periods caused by asthma in children under 15 years in Finland during 1972-1992 were examined. The data were obtained from the Hospital Discharge Register, covering all hospitalisations in Finland. A total of 59,624 asthma related treatment periods were recorded. The monthly variation in hospitalisations peaked in May (35.6% above the trend) and in autumn and early winter (41.3% above the trend in October), whereas the monthly variations were low in late winter and in summer. The overall profile of seasonal variation was similar in both sexes, although admissions were lower for boys than for girls in winter and higher in autumn. The average monthly deviation was highest in the age group 0-4 years in May, 42.8% above the trend, and highest in the age group 5-9 years in October, 53.9% above the trend. Closer examination of the seasonal variation gives indirect information on possible trigger factors for acute asthma., CONCLUSION: A clear seasonal variation could be observed in childhood asthma hospital admissions, together with age and sex-related differences in this seasonality. Preventive treatment for asthma should be used effectively in order to avoid acute attacks leading to hospitalisation in children who are allergic to birch pollen and also at times of viral respiratory infections.

Y1  - 1997//
N2  - Asthma is the most common chronic lung disease diagnosed in children. The rising morbidity and mortality rate of asthma is a major concern to pediatric health care providers. Asthma education is essential for parents and children. Physiological, psychological, cognitive, and developmental concerns of each stage of growth have an impact on asthma symptoms, management, and daily life. An anticipatory-guidance framework allows the nurse to target education to age-specific issues, abilities, and needs.

Residence appeared to play an important role in epidemic process of bronchial asthma. The study proved the increasing occurrence of bronchial asthma and influence of the air pollution on the disease's epidemiology, described incidence of bronchial asthma among various age groups of the children. The results necessitated adjustment of maximal allowable levels of air pollution in Northern towns.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of asthma in urban residents of Shanghai in 1990 and evaluate the risk factors of asthma., METHODS: A cluster uneven random survey of asthma was conducted among 36,872 urban residents, 5/1000 of the population of the city. The asthmatics were suspected based upon case history, and then confirmed by home visit and further investigation. Single factor and unconditional logistic regression analysis were employed to evaluate the risk factors of asthma., RESULTS: The accumulative prevalence of asthma was 1.53% for age group 0-35 and it was higher in male (1.74%) than in female (1.31%). Sex, age and type of living house were possible risk factors. The prevalences were much higher among people with history of TB and pneumonia of which the values of relative risks were 2.53 and 4.95, respectively. Histories of food, drug and other kinds of hypersensitivity were significantly related to the history of asthma., CONCLUSION: Several risk factors possibly associated with asthma were identified in Shanghai area.

A1  - Virchow, J C Jr
Y1  - 1996//
N2  - The term "bronchial asthma" does not describe a single disease but a syndrome with similar symptoms but different etiology. The differences between the several manifestations of asthma have diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic implications. According to clinical criteria atopic-allergic, intrinsic, occupational and mixed-type asthma can be differentiated. The separation into these different groups was initially based on clinical evaluation but is now supported by recent immunologic studies which have found basic differences as well as common features between these manifestations of asthma. To neglect this important diagnostic differentiation, as has been incorrectly proposed in recent years, will impair our understanding of the clinical appearance as well as the pathogenesis of asthma and can lead to inappropriate therapy.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To compare an asthmatic and non-asthmatic group of children by looking at determined characteristics., DESIGN: Study of cases and paired one-to-one controls by age and gender., SETTING: Primary Care., PATIENTS AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Children aged 0 to 13 and attended at one particular Paediatrics clinic were studied (1,100 children). All those children diagnosed with asthma in accordance with the standard procedure in the Health District were considered as cases (142). The control group was chosen at random from the age and gender files., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A telephone poll with closed questions was carried out by three researchers who were "blind" to whether they were dealing with case or control. Statistically significant differences were found for family background of allergic Rhinitis (cases, 43.2%; controls, 30.4%; p = 0.04), atopic eczema (cases, 36.3%; controls, 14.7%; p < 0.001) and bronchial asthma (cases, 59.8%; controls, 33.3%; p < 0.001). Statistically significant differences were also found for personal case histories of allergic Rhinitis (cases, 36.3%; controls, 2%; p < 0.001) and atopic eczema (cases, 23.5%; controls, 10.7%; p = 0.021); and in the presence of animals (dog and/or cat) in the home (cases, 13.7%; controls, 25.5%; p = 0.04). No statistically significant differences were found for background of breast-feeding, age of starting school, present passive smoking or the existence of older siblings., CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained show that the association of atopic illnesses, such as Rhinitis and Eczema, and the existence of family background of asthma and atopy are more common in the asthmatic patient.

Y1  - 1996//
N2  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether historical or clinical variables can accurately discriminate among children, experiencing a first episode of bronchospasm, with chest radiography findings that are normal, consistent with reactive airway disease (RAD), or pathologic., METHODS: We assembled a prospective case series of patients in our tertiary, academic, pediatric emergency department. All patients aged newborn to 18 years presenting to the ED with their initial episode of wheezing were enrolled., RESULTS: Six hundred thirty-three patients presented to the ED during the study period. Pathologic radiographic findings were identified in 39 (6.2%). Radiographs revealing normal findings and evidence of RAD were noted in 25.4% and 68%, respectively. No single variable accurately predicted all pathologic radiographs. Discriminant function analysis identified nine variables, which we combined into a model. The model failed to accurately discriminate among patients with radiographs revealing evidence of a pathologic condition, normal chest findings, and RAD., CONCLUSION: No clinical variables, isolated or combined into a model, accurately identify patients with pathologic radiography findings. Continued use of chest radiography as a diagnostic intervention in the initial episode of childhood bronchospasm is recommended.

N2  - Asthma results from a complex interaction between genetics and environmental factors. Authors have demonstrated the role play by these, however a greatest number of family and asthmatic patients not identify the sources of pollution into their home. A sampling of 369 patients finds that males were predominant mainly affecting before five years of age. 67.2% have factors of risk in their microenvironment (RR = 4.06; OR = 11.38; RA = 53.21; P = .001). Tobacco predominant with 129 patients (RR = 3.12; OR = 3.76; RA = 37.08; P = 0.04). Carpets in 32.29% (RR = 2.81; OR = 4.52; RA = 31.44; P = .007). Animals 19.24% (RR = 1.64; OR = 1.90; RA = 11.27; P = .051). Patients with a great number of broncoespasm acute description have been hospitalized rely on factors risk in their home. Data demonstrate the necessity to design projects of education to limit the family injury.

N2  - The allergy diseases in our province have the characteristic of the early appearance of asthma and predominant monosensitization to the domestic dust is mites due to the climate condition. In this work we study the influence of allergic children. We selected 1,028 mothers who went to the hospital with their children for the 1st time. We divide them in 2 groups. One of 459 mothers of atopic children (MA) and another of 569 no atopic's (MC). All mothers were skin prick-tested (Phazet). The papular area was the mothers with aeroallergen sensitization were the 180 (17,5%) between (MA) 126 (274%) and (MC) 54 (95%). The 180 mothers were sensitized to: D. Pteronyssinus 66.3%, D. Farinae 65,5%., Lolium p 14.55%, Cats 11.6% (MA > MC), Artemisia V (6,25% and Cladosporium H (0,6%).

N2  - Genetic phenotypic risk factors have been investigated in 1630 children with various forms of acute respiratory diseases and in control groups (314 children with bronchial asthma, 768 healthy children). Each of them was estimated by points using special elaborated prognostic tables. This allowed to distribute children into risk groups according to the development of disease from the moment of birth.

N2  - Splenectomized children as well as those suffering from nephrotic syndrome or recurrent asthmatic bronchitis have an increased susceptibility to systemic pneumococcal infections compared to healthy children. To determine the immunogenicity and safety of a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV), 119 children (21 healthy, 26 splenectomized children, 48 with nephrotic syndrome and 24 with recurrent asthmatic bronchitis), aged 2-18 years, received one subcutaneous injection of a 23-valent PPV. Anti-capsular antibodies (Ab) to types 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F were measured by ELISA before and 4 weeks after immunization. In all cases the adverse reactions were mild and transient, consisting of local pain and/or erythema or swelling in 41% and fever above 38.5 degrees C in 2% of the children. The healthy children responded well to vaccination with a mean fold increase (FI) of 2.6 in postvaccination Ab titers compared to prevaccination titers. The combined geometric mean Ab concentrations in the high-risk children were significantly lower than those of healthy children both before and after vaccination. However, the combined geometric mean FI were not significantly different between high-risk and healthy children. These results indicate that PPV is immunogenic and safe in high-risk as well as in healthy Korean children.

N2  - Using a large data base of respiratory morbidity in children the opportunity arose to explore the link between what was written in general practice case records and the subsequent risk of a child developing an asthma attack or hospital admission due to asthma. Children with five or more consultations in one year for respiratory symptoms had a 33% risk of experiencing an asthma attack or 7.1% risk of admission in the following year. Twenty seven percent of children who received antibiotics for "respiratory infections" subsequently had an asthma attack. The potential exists to review past and present symptoms and thus attempt to predict future morbidity. Childhood asthma is an example where the quality of care offered by general practitioners could be improved if a precise estimate of risk could be used to modify clinical management.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Many young children wheeze during viral respiratory infections, but the pathogenesis of these episodes and their relation to the development of asthma later in life are not well understood., METHODS: In a prospective study, we investigated the factors affecting wheezing before the age of three years and their relation to wheezing at six years of age. Of 1246 newborns in the Tucson, Arizona, area enrolled between May 1980 and October 1984, follow-up data at both three and six years of age was available for 826. For these children, assessments in infancy included measurement of cord-serum IgE levels (measured in 750 children), pulmonary-function testing before any lower respiratory illness had occurred (125), measurement of serum IgE levels at nine months of age (672), and questionnaires completed by the children's parents when the children were one year old (800). Assessments at six years of age included measurement of serum IgE levels (in 460), pulmonary-function testing (526), and skin allergy testing (629)., RESULTS: At the age of six years, 425 children (51.5 percent) had never wheezed, 164 (19.9 percent) had had at least one lower respiratory illness with wheezing during the first three years of life but had no wheezing at six years of age, 124 (15.0 percent) had no wheezing before the age of three years but had wheezing at the age of six years, and 113 (13.7 percent) had wheezing both before three years of age and at six years of age. The children who had wheezing before three years of age but not at the age of six had diminished airway function (length-adjusted maximal expiratory flow at functional residual capacity [Vmax FRC]) both before the age of one year and at the age of six years, were more likely than the other children to have mothers who smoked but not mothers with asthma, and did not have elevated serum IgE levels or skin-test reactivity. Children who started wheezing in early life and continued to wheeze at the age of six were more likely than the children who never wheezed to have mothers with a history of asthma (P < 0.001), to have elevated serum IgE levels (P < 0.01), to have normal lung function in the first year of life, and to have elevated serum IgE levels (P < 0.001) and diminished values for VmaxFRC (P < 0.01) at six years of age., CONCLUSIONS: The majority of infants with wheezing have transient conditions associated with diminished airway function at birth and do not have increased risks of asthma or allergies later in life. In a substantial minority of infants, however, wheezing episodes are probably related to a predisposition to asthma.

N2  - Chronic bronchitis in childhood is a diverse group of illnesses with pathophysiology differing markedly from the adult condition. Airway disease in children is very common and results in significant and increasing morbidity and mortality. Chronic abnormalities in the bronchioles secondary to infection and morbidity of the bronchi secondary to neonatal problems are unique to children. Because more of these children are reaching adult life each day, these conditions are highlighted. Differential diagnosis, clinical evaluation, and recent treatment advances are discussed.

N2  - Allergy is the conjunction of hereditary predisposition and risk factors encountered in the environment, phenomenon which can be observed very early in individual life. The aim of this review is to present the contribution of epidemiology in the study of allergic response in childhood, from sensitization to clinical manifestations as eczema, asthma and rhinitis. The first contribution of epidemiology has consisted in estimating the scatter of the allergic response, the presence of circulating antibodies against allergens (IgE and IgG), the evaluation of immediate hypersensitivity (such as the response to skin prick tests) and the prevalence of clinical manifestations. Then, knowledge of allergic response has been improved by the contribution of aetiological epidemiology. Various risk factors have been described according to the different stages during life in which their effects are observable. In prenatal life, potential risk factors are maternal immunity and smoking during pregnancy. Later in perinatal or neonatal life they are perinatal complications, month of birth and maternal smoking. Lastly, in infancy a role can be played by feeding, immunological deficiencies, infections, parental smoking and early exposure to allergens or pollution. Perceiving these risk factors helps to determine strategies to prevent allergy occurrence.

N2  - Children with asthma who are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke are at increased risk for adverse health consequences. An experimental design was used to evaluate a minimal-contact intervention aimed at modifying parents' smoking behavior in their homes. All subjects received counseling on the health effects of passive smoking and advice to quit smoking inside the home. Treatment subjects were also mailed the results of a urine cotinine test on their child and a self-help manual. More treatment (35%) than control (17%) subjects reported smoking outside their homes at posttest (and their children's cotinine levels were lower), but this difference was not statistically significant.

N2  - In a group of 228 patients with Asthma-Prurigo syndrome in 82.5% of patients the onset of skin lesions was earlier than the onset of asthma. It was found that the early onset of atopic dermatitis suggests the greater probability of subsequent asthma. In 88.6% of patients also other allergic diseases were diagnosed, and rhinitis allergica was observed most frequently. In the investigated group of patients urticaria chronica idiopathica or physical urticarias were not observed. Among 228 patients with Asthma-Prurigo syndrome, 74.6% of patients pointed to house dust as one of the most frequent causative factors. The house dust similarly to other inhalant allergens, somewhat more frequently had influence on the course of atopic dermatitis than on the course of asthma. Contrary to this observation according to patients food allergens (milk, eggs, fish, chocolate) aggravated or induced the relapses of skin lesions much more frequently than asthma. It was shown how often patients noticed adverse reactions due to penicillin and sulphonamides.

N2  - Over a period of 12 months from 1981 to 1982, 83 patients aged less than 2 years were treated in hospital for acute bronchiolitis. The children were followed-up prospectively; 68 (83%) completed the study until 4.5-6.0 years of age. At this age, 17 (25%) of the 68 children with bronchiolitis still suffered from wheezing attacks. These 17 asthmatics suffered from both atopic dermatitis (29 versus 6%) and allergic rhinitis (29 versus 8%) more frequently than non-asthmatic children. In contrast, positive results in the skin prick tests were almost equally common (29 and 20%) in asthmatic and non-asthmatic children. In these tests, allergies to birch pollen, timothy grass pollen and house dust mite were most common; asthma was particularly associated with house dust mite allergy. The presence of atopic dermatitis, elevated immunoglobulin E values and repeated wheezing episodes between 1 and 2 years of age were significant risk factors for later asthma. In conclusion, the risk for later asthma is increased after early childhood bronchiolitis; the frequency of asthma was 25% in the present study. Our results confirm that atopics are at a greater risk of developing asthma later in childhood than non-atopics; the risk was significant from 1 year of age onwards.

N2  - The hospitalization and mortality rates incurred from childhood asthma continue to rise despite recent progress into the pathophysiology and treatment of reactive airway disease. We believe that there are specific factors that identify children at risk for death from asthma. The objective of the study was to determine those risk factors that identify children at increased risk for nonfatal, but life-threatening asthma exacerbations resulting in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission. Patients aged 10 months-16 years admitted to Brenner Children's Hospital for status asthmaticus between April 1991 and December 1992 were evaluated with regard to the prevalence of eight different factors using two categories for asthma: (1) life-threatening asthma requiring PICU admission and (2) non-life-threatening asthma requiring routine hospitalization. Risk factors associated with an increased prevalence of non-fatal, but life-threatening asthma requiring PICU sensitivity state. The classification employed here seemed to provide some merits in delineating the features of adulthood asthma.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the infantile risk factors and long-term outcome up to 8 to 10 years of age for bronchial asthma and hyperreactivity in children with early-childhood bronchiolitis or pneumonia., DESIGN: Prospective follow-up of three groups of children., SETTING: University hospital providing primary hospital care and outpatient consultations for all pediatric patients in a defined area., INTERVENTIONS: None., PATIENTS: The study groups consisted of 62 children with early-childhood bronchiolitis, 29 children with early-childhood pneumonia with no wheezing, and 52 control children., METHODS: Infantile risk factors were prospectively registered until 2 years of age. Clinical examination, performed 7 to 8 years later, included recording of atopic and asthmatic symptoms from the preceding 12 months. The methacholine inhalation challenge test was used to assess bronchial hyperreactivity, and mean midexpiratory flow results were used to assess bronchial obstruction., MAIN RESULTS: Bronchial asthma was present in nine (15%) of the 62 children from the bronchiolitis group, compared with 7% in the pneumonia group and 2% in the control group. Bronchial hyperreactivity indicated by methacholine inhalation challenge was far more common; it was present in 62% of the bronchiolitis group and in 45% of the pneumonia group. Both groups differed significantly from the control group. Decreased mean midexpiratory flow values were observed in 29% and 21% of the bronchiolitis and pneumonia groups, respectively. All 10 asthmatic patients had bronchial hyperreactivity, but only 20% of hyperreactive children had asthma. An analysis of infantile risk factors disclosed only one, an early onset of wheezing, with a significant effect on bronchial hyperreactivity at school age. Elevated IgE values measured during infancy were associated with the development of clinical asthma., CONCLUSIONS: The risk of bronchial asthma was increased after infantile bronchiolitis. Moreover, bronchial hyperreactivity was increased after both infantile bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Methacholine inhalation challenge was a sensitive but nonspecific test for diagnosing bronchial asthma. Both bronchiolitis and pneumonia resulting in hospitalization in early childhood distinguish a group of children with an increased risk for long-term lung function abnormalities and pulmonary illnesses.

N2  - The objective of our study was to assess the occurrence of respiratory symptoms in relation to dampness and molds in dwellings in pre-school children. A population-based cross-sectional study was carried out by mailing a parent-administered questionnaire to a random sample of children in a source population consisting of all children aged 1 to 6 years of Espoo, an urban-suburban city (pop. 170,000) in the Helsinki metropolitan area. The study population included a total of 2568 children whose parents filled the questionnaire (response rate 80%). Included were questions on respiratory health, partly modified from ATS-DLD-78-C questionnaire, and potential personal and environmental determinants of the outcome. The determinants of interest were histories of water damage, presence of moisture and visible molds and perceived mold odor at home. The outcomes included persistent cough, phlegm and wheezing, persistent nasal congestion and excretion during the past 12 months and current asthma. The determinant-outcome relations were estimated in the logistic regression controlling for age, gender, parents' education, single parent or guardian, environmental tobacco smoke, gas cooking, pets and type of day care. The occurrence of persistent cough (OR 2.17; 95% CI 1.39, 3.39), phlegm (2.20; 1.27, 3.82), wheezing (2.62; 1.39, 4.39), nasal congestion (1.94; 1.15, 4.98), and nasal excretion (1.43; 0.95, 2.17) during the past year were higher with the presence of any determinant, but the occurrence of asthma (OR 1.10; 0.54, 2.24) was similar compared to the reference group. Mold odor during the past year (ORs from 2.38 to 6.87) and water damage over a year ago (ORs from 2.54 to 8.67) had the strongest association with the respiratory symptoms. A dose-response relation of the occurrence of the symptoms associated with the frequency of days with mold odor was observed. There was also a compatible time sequence between water damage taking place more than a year ago and the occurrence of symptoms during the past year. The results provide further evidence on the importance of home dampness and molds in the etiology of respiratory symptoms and new information on the role of mold odor as a risk indicator.

N2  - The prevalence of wheezy illness in children is increasing, along with the number of children diagnosed as having asthma. If physicians are to provide the most effective treatment for these patients, they need to be fully aware of advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of asthma and of the new and improved treatments that these have brought about.

N2  - Asthma is currently considered by many to be a disease out of control. The prevalence and severity of asthma have increased in recent years, especially in children. Asthma is a very diagnosable condition. Better methods for treatment and monitoring now exist. It is hoped that with the implementation of expanded knowledge of asthma, this very common condition in childhood can be brought under better control.

N2  - This study examines in urban area the housing conditions in asthma patients who called a first-aid association of doctors (SOS Medecins) and their relationships to symptoms. The patient population is compared with the non asthmatic population who called SOS Medecins during the same period. During the first six months of 1989, among 102,791 calls, 701 were related to acute asthma symptoms, and 100 non asthma patients were sorted at random as a control group. A telephonic questionnary has been carried out to asthmatic patients and to control group. A particular aspect of asthma in Paris is given in this study: the homogeneous distribution of asthma attacks in the different districts of Paris, (with a light prevalence in three districts of the city). Sex, age, occupation were non discriminant and no significant difference was established in housing conditions and indoor air pollution sources, between the two groups of asthma and non-asthma patients.

N2  - Deformities of the chest occur not only in asthmatics suffering from severe attacks, but also in those having a mild form of the disease. It also occurs in children with atopic dermatitis and in members of atopic families without concomitant bronchial asthma. This observation and the fact that asthmatic children tend towards hyposomia, has prompted auxological investigations of asthmatic children. It was of interest to see whether asthma itself or the atopic disposition is responsible for disturbances of growth and development. The investigation was carried out as a cross-sectional study involving 173 asthmatic boys aged 1 1/2-18 years. The programme included among other things age, bone age, bone maturity difference (BMD: difference age minus bone age) height, type and severity of asthma (measured by means of scope of therapy). The rate of hyposomia (height < mean -2 SD) amounted in the whole group to 4.7 per cent. It rose in the extrinsic asthmatics to 6.6 per cent. This corresponds with a rise of two or three times the normal rate. 11.6 per cent of the probands showed a skeletal retardation of more than 2 years. The degree of BMD showed a significant dependence on age and type of asthma but not on the duration of the disease, severity or glucocorticoid therapy. Skeletal retardation cannot, therefore, be regarded as a direct consequence of bronchial asthma, whereas the significantly different averages of BMD in extrinsic and intrinsic asthmatics point to an atopic genesis, hence it might be possible to speak of an atopic retardation of the skeleton.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

T1  - Relapse following emergency treatment for acute asthma: can it be predicted or prevented?.
A1  - Ducharme, F M

Y1  - 1993//
N2  - We prospectively followed 314 children discharged from a children's hospital emergency department (ED) following an asthma attack, to identify risk, factors for relapse, i.e. a second ED visit for asthma within the next 10 days. Parents were surveyed concerning their child's past medical history, drugs received prior to the index visit, triggering factors, physician availability, parental anxiety, and sociodemographic variables. Data on severity of the attack, emergency treatment, response to treatment and drugs prescribed on discharge were extracted from the medical record. Ninety-six of the 314 children (31%) relapsed, most (68%) within 24 hours. Using multiple logistic regression, a predictive model was developed on 211 patients ("test sample"). The best model contained two variables: (1) the number of ED visits for acute asthma in the previous year (odds ratio [OR] = 2.4 for 4 or more vs fewer visits, 95% CI = 1.3-4.4) and (2) the intake of an oral short-acting theophylline preparation during the course of the acute treatment (OR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.2-0.7). The sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values of this model for predicting relapse were 73, 53, and 40%, respectively. When applied to a second randomly selected "validation sample" of 103 children, sensitivity was 73%, specificity 50%, and PPV 41%, thus indicating the stability of the model. The model identifies the number of ED visits in the previous year as an important risk factor for relapse. It also suggests that oral short-acting theophylline may still have a role in the treatment of patients in whom the contribution of inflammation to airway obstruction is minimal.

N2  - Parental histories of childhood respiratory trouble (CRT) were examined as risk factors for lower respiratory tract illnesses in healthy infants enrolled in the Children's Respiratory Study, Tucson, Arizona. A parental history of childhood respiratory trouble before age 16 was a risk factor for infantile lower respiratory tract illnesses (LRIs). Early age of onset of the parental CRT and those illnesses described as asthma or bronchiolitis showed the greatest risk: odds ratio = 2.8, P < 0.05. After controlling for known and suspected confounders, a parental history of CRT described as asthma or bronchiolitis with onset before age 3 was associated with wheezing LRIs in their children, with an odds ratio of 2.6, P < 0.05. A parental history of CRT described as bronchitis/croup was associated with nonwheezing LRIs in their children: odds ratio = 2.2, P < 0.05. These findings suggest a familial component to childhood respiratory trouble which may have a hereditary basis.

N2  - All inpatients at a regional hospital in Sweden referred for a paediatric dental consultation (n = 269) were studied retrospectively during a two-year period. The children were studied concerning their medical and oral condition and subsequent dental treatment. The most frequent medical condition among the referred children was insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (20%), asthma (9%) and epilepsy (7%). Children with asthma exhibited a significantly increased caries prevalence (p < 0.01) compared to other chronically sick children. Of the children examined 53% were diagnosed with diseases or abnormalities in the oral cavity requiring treatment. Gingivitis, disturbances in occlusal development and dental caries were the most commonly found diagnoses Acute dental or oral problems were diagnosed in 9% of the children. The mean time allocated for each patient was 60 minutes. Thirty percent of the children were subsequently treated at the paediatric dentistry specialist clinic. In conclusion the study emphasises the need of paediatric dental consultation services at regional hospitals.

N2  - Cross-sectional surveys of Norwegian populations indicate that 14-17 per cent of the children below the age of 15 years have had an allergic disease. The corresponding figure in adults is 37 per cent. Among children allergic diseases tend to be more frequent in boys than in girls. In adults there is no significant sex-difference regarding the prevalences of hay fever and obstructive lung disease, while eczema and urticaria are more frequent in women than in men. There is an association of smoking, occupational airborne exposure and degree of industrialization to the prevalences of allergic diseases. There are indications of an increase in occurrence of allergic diseases. The need for standardized operative definitions of these diseases is emphasized.

N2  - An increase in mortality related to asthma has been observed in a great number of countries during the last decade. The purpose of this work is to study this evolution in France from 1970 to 1987. Numbers of deaths were obtained from INSERM, by sex and age groups and the corresponding populations from INSEE. Data were interpreted from crude rates and with the computation of age adjusted and age specific rates. In men, we observed a decrease in mortality from 1972 to 1979, then an increase from 1980 to 1987. In women, the decrease stopped as early as 1974 and we observed an increase from 1975 to 1987. On the other hand their crude and age-adjusted rates become higher than men's rates as early as 1977.

N2  - The relationship of breast feeding to atopic diseases is studied in a population-based cross sectional study in Munich and Bavaria 1989/1990 in 6,535 german ten year old children. According to the questionnaire answers 1914 (29.3%) children were not breast fed, 2,368 (36.2%) shorter than 2 months, 1,744 (26.7%) 2 to 6 months and 509 (7.8%) more than 6 months. Compared to controls without any allergic disease the relative risk of later asthma, hayfever, atopic dermatitis and of allergic skin sensitization was not diminished by breast feeding. The same result pertained to high risk subgroups defined by positive family history of asthma or hayfever. It is concluded that breast feeding alone has no long term protective effect against atopic diseases.

N2  - After seven pediatric cases of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) were diagnosed in a farming community in upstate New York, a questionnaire regarding symptoms and potential risk factors of CFS was distributed to all students enrolled in the same school district. Twenty-one students with symptoms of CFS were identified. Two controls per case matched for age and sex were randomly selected from questionnaire respondents. Health status was verified for all subjects by telephone, and diagnosis of CFS was confirmed by a physician. Information was collected on the following factors: symptoms of CFS among other family members; history of allergy/asthma; consumption of raw milk, raw eggs, raw cheese, or raw meat; water supply; exposure to animals; home heating source; proximity to farmland/orchards; tick bite; blood transfusion; camping; and appendicitis. Logistic-regression analyses indicated that the best model (characterized by symptoms among other family members, recent ingestion of raw milk, and history of allergy/asthma) produced significant estimates of relative risk (P less than .05) of 35.9, 44.3, and 23.3, respectively, for the three factors (corrections were made for the effect of the other covariates). These data suggest that a combination of host and environmental factors, including an infectious agent or agents, are involved in the etiology of CFS.

N2  - This case-control study investigated the possible association between home environmental air pollutants and their effect on otitis media and asthma in children. Patients with physician-diagnosed otitis (n = 125, 74% response), with asthma (n = 137, 80% response), and controls (n = 237, 72% response) from a private pediatric practice seen between October 1986 and May 1987 were studied. A questionnaire inquired about housing characteristics (i.e., age, insulation, heating system) and sources of indoor air pollution such as cigarette smoking, use of woodburning stoves, household pets, etc. Analysis of the responses confirmed previous findings of significant relationships between maternal smoking (P = .021), and the presence of pets (P = .034) and the occurrence of asthma. A newly reported relationship between exposure to woodburning stoves and the occurrence of otitis (P less than .05) was reported. This implicates yet another risk factor (wood burning) in the etiology of otitis media.

N2  - Bronchial Asthma morbidity and mortality appear to be increasing. In our continuing endeavor to investigate the asthma problem in Puerto Rico, we describe the profile or group of pediatric patients admitted with asthma during a three month period of time to a community hospital. This is intended to be an initial step in developing a more detailed study to evaluate risk factors for hospitalization and need for acute care management of children with asthma in Puerto Rico. We evaluated a group of patients admitted with the diagnosis of asthma (ICD-9 code 493). One hundred and nineteen admissions between August 22 and November 21, 1990 (ninety days) were reviewed retrospectively. Data extracted from the records included demographic, laboratory and physiological variables. Results were similar for both sexes. Asthma admissions represented 29 percent of the total admissions with a hospital stay of 4.07 +/- 1.09 days and age of 4.62 +/- 4.29 years (mean +/- SD). No pulmonary function tests were performed as criteria for admission. In conclusion, this study suggests that the need for hospitalization in children with asthma in a community hospital is based on clinical evaluation. The use of pulmonary function tests, peak expiratory flow measurement or both may not be suitable for the majority of children admitted with asthma due to age. Other criteria for younger children with asthma need to be developed.

N2  - This study analyzes data from the Second National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey to determine whether black children are more likely to have asthma or wheeze, even after adjusting for environmental and socioeconomic exposures. For children 6 months to 11 yr of age, the unadjusted prevalence for asthma was 3.0% among white children and 7.2% among blacks; prevalence of frequent wheeze was 6.2% among whites and 9.3% among blacks. In a logistic regression model including race, age, and sex, the relative odds (RO) of asthma for black children as compared to white children were 2.5 (95% confidence interval [Cl], 1.9 to 3.4). Other predictors of asthma in a stepwise logistic regression included age, sex (boys versus girls, RO = 1.4), younger maternal age (2 standard deviation [SD] drop in age, RO = 1.4), residence in the central city (RO = 1.6), and family income (RO for the lowest versus highest tertile, RO = 1.7). After adjusting for these risk factors, age and sex, black children still had a 1.7 RO (95% Cl, 1.2 to 2.1) of having asthma. Frequent wheeze was associated with race (black versus white, RO = 1.6), sex (boys versus girls, RO = 1.3), birth weight (2 SD deficit in birth weight, RO = 1.4), and triceps skinfold thickness (increase in odds of asthma for 2 SD increase in skinfold, RO = 1.6). The significant effect of maternal age and birth weight after adjusting for other confounding variables suggests that the in utero environment may be an important determinant of asthma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

N2  - BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Children with asthma commonly have positive skin tests for inhaled allergens, and in the United Kingdom the majority of older children with asthma are sensitized to the house-dust mite. In a cohort of British children at risk for allergic disease because of family history, we investigated prospectively from 1978 to 1989 the relation between exposure to the house-dust mite allergen (Der p I) and the development of sensitization and asthma., RESULTS: Of the 67 children studied in 1989, 35 were atopic (positive skin tests), and 32 were nonatopic. Of the 17 with active asthma, 16 were atopic (P less than 0.005), all of whom were sensitized to the house-dust mite, as judged by positive skin tests and levels of specific IgE antibodies (P less than 0.001). For house-dust samples collected from the homes of 59 of the children in 1979 and from 65 homes in 1989, the geometric means for the highest Der p I exposure were, respectively, 16.1 and 16.8 micrograms per gram of sieved dust. There was a trend toward an increasing degree of sensitization at the age of 11 with greater exposure at the age of 1 (P = 0.062). All but one of the children with asthma at the age of 11 had been exposed at 1 year of age to more than 10 micrograms of Der p I per gram of dust; for this exposure, the relative risk of asthma was 4.8 (P = 0.05). The age at which the first episode of wheezing occurred was inversely related to the level of exposure at the age of 1 for all children (P = 0.015), but especially for the atopic children (r = -0.66, P = 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: In addition to genetic factors, exposure in early childhood to house-dust mite allergens is an important determinant of the subsequent development of asthma.

N2  - To test the possible influence of atmospheric pollution on the frequency of asthmatic exacerbations we have looked to see whether there is a link between the number of daily admissions for asthma in hospitals in Saint-Nazaire and data from pollution sensors in the network of the Association for the Measurement of Atmospheric Pollution in the Loire estuary. The pollutions studied were sulphur dioxide, oxide of nitrogen (NOx) and non sedimenting dust (black smoke). The meteorological data (speed and direction of the wind and temperature) were also recorded. The study was carried out for 18 months in a retrospective fashion. During this period 372 hospital admissions were recorded in 229 subjects. The number of daily admissions correlated in a significant fashion with the level of black smoke (r = 0.149, p less than 0.001) and this result was particularly due to subjects who were less than 15 years old. In this group the frequency of hospital admission was doubled on those days when the level of smoke was at its most elevated. There was a weak link between the peaks of SO2 (r = 0.116, p less than 0.05). An analysis of the place of residence in those hospitals and the dominant direction of the wind did not enable us to confirm the role of the principal sources of industrial pollution, which were all situated to the east of Saint-Nazaire.

T1  - Racial, social, and environmental risks for childhood asthma.

Y1  - 1990//
N2  - Unlike a number of childhood problems, it is not clear that there are racial or socioeconomic disparities in the prevalence of childhood asthma. We analyzed data from the Child Health Supplement to the 1981 National health Interview Survey, a population-based survey with information concerning 15,416 children, to address the following questions: are there racial or socioeconomic differences in rates of childhood asthma; if yes, what is the contribution of social and environmental characteristics to the observed differences? In this sample, black children were more likely to have asthma than were white children (4.4% vs. 2.5%). Racial disparities in prevalence emerged early and at all childhood ages were due to higher black rates of onset between the ages of 1 and 3 years. Poverty status, maternal cigarette smoking, large family size, smaller size of home, low birth weight, and maternal age younger than 20 years at the child's birth were all associated with increased rates of childhood asthma. When available social and environmental characteristics were controlled for using multivariate analyses, the increased risk for asthma among black and poor children was reduced to statistical insignificance. We conclude that black and poor children in the United States do have higher rates of asthma, that social and environmental factors exert substantial influences on rates of asthma, and that much of the racial and economic disparity in prevalence can be accounted for by a variety of social and environmental characteristics.

N2  - Information on the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among children and adolescents requiring medical care is sparse. A small but significant risk of seroconversion occurs in health care workers who handle blood and body fluids of patients infected with HIV. The prevalence of HIV seropositivity in children who had phlebotomy as part of emergency care was measured. Of 749 blood samples, 21 (2.8%) tested positive for HIV antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western Blot analysis: 14 samples from 6 patients with hemophilia, 6 from 3 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related complex, and 1 from a patient with asthma. Of these 21 blood samples, 10 were from 4 children previously known to be HIV positive, 4 were from patients with a known parental risk factor, and 16 were from patients with known history of blood transfusion. One sample was from a children with unknown HIV status and no documented risk factors. Procedures included 9 venipunctures, 17 intravenous line placements, 1 lumbar puncture, and 1 pelvic examination. Most patients with HIV seropositivity had been known to be HIV seropositive or at significant risk for HIV seropositivity. Although the potential risk to health care workers from children without known risk factors for HIV seropositivity was small in this population, the currently recommended infection-control precautions should always be observed.

T1  - It is children with atopic dermatitis who develop asthma more frequently if the mother smokes.
A1  - Murray, A B

Y1  - 1990//
N2  - We elicited symptoms of atopic dermatitis (AD) and of asthma from 620 children who were themselves nonsmokers, were aged 1 to 17 years, and had been consecutively referred to an allergy clinic. A histamine bronchial-challenge test revealed bronchial hyperresponsiveness in 95% of the children who had a history of wheezing or asthma and who could perform the test reliably, indicating that most of them did indeed have asthma. Children with a history of AD were much more likely to have asthma if the mother was a smoker than if she was a nonsmoker (79% versus 52%; p = 0.001). Similarly, if AD was found on examination, the percentages with asthma were 74% and 44%, respectively. By contrast, the children with no history of AD had asthma as frequently if the mother was a nonsmoker (42%) as when she was a smoker (40%). In children with AD, the prevalence of asthma was greater in both boys and girls when the mother was a smoker, but only in boys when the father was a smoker. Multiple logistic regression confirmed that the risk of asthma was greatly increased when the child had both AD and a mother who smoked.

T1  - Airways and air pollution in childhood: state of the art.
A1  - Hoppenbrouwers, T
Y1  - 1990//
N2  - Correlations between ambient pollutants and health effects, such as observed in SIDS, may in reality be to a larger extent the result of indoor sources. These distinctions between indoor and outdoor sources, while important, do not detract from the overall conclusion that pollution affects the airway in children directly and indirectly. Much still needs to be learned about the permanence of these effects, the mechanism by which the effect is mediated, and the conditions under which some of these effects are maximal. Two approaches seem particularly suited to shed further light on these issues. First, identification of biological markers for exposure to pollutants will yield both more accurate measures of exposure to pollutants and information about health consequences. Second, newer modeling techniques promise to predict health outcomes under a variety of environmental conditions. Shumway et al., for instance, describe a promising model predicting an increase in mortality due to ambient pollutants in the Los Angeles Basin with higher levels under extremes of temperature, especially during cold spells. Time series and factor analyses may further our knowledge as well. In the near future, large cohort studies should begin to reveal the cumulative effects of air pollution on the respiratory system, especially in relation to active smoking. Finally, studies in Black children are virtually unavailable. Given their high risk for respiratory illnesses, such studies are sorely needed.

T1  - Prevention of pediatric pulmonary problems: the importance of maternal smoking.
A1  - Taylor, B
Y1  - 1990//
N2  - Although many factors are associated with lower respiratory illnesses in children, few can be identified as likely direct causal influences. Maternal smoking has been strongly associated with respiratory morbidity in early life. The relationship is consistent in different studies, and is dose-related. It is also resistant to attempts at statistical control for factors that might confound the association. The effect seems most marked from maternal smoking during pregnancy. Stopping young women taking up cigarette smoking is a priority preventive medical need.

T1  - Nonpharmacologic means of preventing asthma.
A1  - Price, J A
Y1  - 1990//
N2  - Cessation of smoking in the home is one of the most important nonpharmacologic actions to be recommended. There is a highly significant increase in wheezing, coughing, and respiratory infections in children with smoking mothers, and this increase is directly proportional to the number of cigarettes smoked. Cord blood IgE levels are increased in babies whose mothers smoke during pregnancy. Other agents, such as sulpur dioxide and chemical pollutants from industrial processes may play a role in the development or exacerbation, of asthma symptoms and should be avoided. One of the most interesting areas in food allergy is whether breast feeding causes sensitization or induces tolerance in infants to foods ingested by the mother. There is an increase in asthma in second-generation immigrant populations who are exposed, from birth, to the Western style of living which increases their exposure to house dust mite. Several studies have shown that month of birth is important in the development of specific allergies, for example, in the incidence of birch pollen allergy in Scandinavia. The presence of a pet in the home at birth is associated with a greater incidence of allergy to that animal. Our study in asthmatic children has shown a strong association (p less than 0.001) between the presence of allergens in the air in their homes (sampled retrospectively in the month of birth) with a positive skin test to those allergens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

T1  - Determinants and regulating processes in bronchial hyperreactivity.
A1  - Neijens, H J
Y1  - 1990//
N2  - Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) can be considered as a feature of asthma, although only a loose relationship is present with symptoms and severity of the disease. Epidemiology of BHR may inform about determining factors in BHR and its role as a risk factor. BHR is found already at a young age, mostly diminishes with age, and increases in many asthmatic patients after midlife. Genetic determinants are suggested by familial segregation and twin studies. Allergy, respiratory infections, and cigarette smoking are found to induce increase in BHR and to modify its degree at the long run. The mechanisms in BHR are being unraveled gradually. A chronic inflammation with an important role for eosinophils, mast cells, and others, is thought to modify bronchial mechanisms, such as smooth muscle, epithelium, and autonomic systems. Growing evidence supports that T lymphocytes are implicated and may determine many of the inflammatory cells, such as eosinophils, neutrophils, and mast cells.

N2  - A questionnaire on the prognosis of bronchial asthma was sent in 1988 to 1,592 patients (1,038 males, 554 females) averaging 20 years of age after 12 years' follow up. The results were as follows: 75.6% in remission, 18.2% improved, 4.0% unchanged, 0.9% worse and 1.3% dead from asthma. The average age of onset was 2.7 years, about 1 year earlier than that in our report of 1965. The average age of remission (growing out of asthma) was 13.0 years for males and 12.3 years for females. The prognosis was significantly poorer among asthmatics with an onset age of under 2 years, with a 10-year history of asthma before the first visit to our hospital, with severe attack at the initial visit, a history of admissions for the attacks and food allergy. The asthmatic children with food allergy had a 1-year earlier onset of attack, a more severe attack at the initial visit, more eczema in infancy, and 2 or more other allergic complications than children without food allergy. We have to closely follow and care for those asthmatic children with high risk factors for an extended period.

N2  - The role of childhood respiratory infections before 12 yrs of age (CRI) and during adolescence-adulthood (ARI) was studied in a general population sample (n = 3,289), living in an unpolluted area of Northern Italy. The presence of respiratory symptoms and diseases, as well as risk factors for obstructive airways disease (OAD), was assessed by a standardized questionnaire. Forced vital capacity and derived expiratory flows, and single-breath diffusing capacity were measured using computerized instrumentation. There were 1,185 (36.2%) subjects who reported pertussis (PT), 374 (11.4%) recurrent chest colds, pneumonia and croup, singly or in combination, with or without pertussis (CRI), and 1,718 (52.4%) reported no respiratory infections in childhood (NOCRI). Prevalence rates of respiratory symptoms and diseases were significantly higher in subjects of the CRI group in all ages, and in older smokers. Wheeze and attacks of shortness of breath with wheeze were significantly higher in younger nonsmoking subjects with a history of CRI. Respiratory symptoms and diseases were not more prevalent in subjects of the PT group. Prevalence rates of respiratory symptoms and diseases were significantly higher in subjects with a history of ARI, both in smokers and nonsmokers. Lung function parameters adjusted for sex, age and smoking were significantly lower in CRI subjects; PT subjects showed lower values than NOCRI subjects. A significantly higher prevalence rate of ARI was present in subjects who reported CRI, both in smokers and nonsmokers. Subjects with both CRI and ARI showed the highest prevalence of respiratory symptoms and diseases. In addition, they had the lowest lung function values regardless of smoking habit.

T1  - Respiratory failure from asthma. A marker for children with high morbidity and mortality.
A1  - Newcomb, R W
A1  - Akhter, J
Y1  - 1988//
N2  - During a seven-year interval, 78 children had documented episodes of respiratory failure from asthma, defined as arterial hypoxemia, hypercapnia, or use of mechanical ventilatory support or intravenous isoproterenol hydrochloride. During 407 patient-years of follow-up (5.2 years per patient), these 78 children had 227 episodes of respiratory failure (2.9 episodes per patient). Fifty-three patients (68%) have had two or more of such episodes. Second episodes usually followed the initial episodes within two years, but some were delayed for over six years. Seven of the 78 children died, and two others have incurred hypoxic brain damage, compared with two deaths among 2892 children with asthma--seen at this hospital during that interval--but without a documented previous episode of respiratory failure. We conclude that children whose asthma has caused even one episode of respiratory failure constitute a special group of asthmatic patients, members of which are at high risk for repeated episodes of respiratory failure and its catastrophic complications. This recognition allows special attention to be focused on them in designing both clinical and research strategies.

T1  - The risk of allergy in asthma.
A1  - Suliaman, F
A1  - Townley, R G
Y1  - 1987//
N2  - The prevalence of atopy among asthmatics is more than 70 per cent. Atopy is more prevalent among older children and young asthmatic adults. It is inherited, but the pattern of inheritance is not well defined. Increase in total IgE is one manifestation of atopy, and increase in IgE in early infancy is a predictor of atopic illness, including asthma. Sensitization to allergens and repeated exposure is one of the triggers of developing asthma in atopic patients. Allergy even without asthma (allergic rhinitis) is associated with an increase in bronchial reactivity. Allergy is a risk factor in occupational asthma and in exercise induced asthma. In fact, many non-asthmatic allergic rhinitis patients wheeze with exercise. Allergen avoidance and environmental control may contribute to the well-being of many asthmatics. Allergy hyposensitization (immunotherapy) may help control asthma in allergic patients.

T1  - Atopic dermatitis, house dust mite allergy and month of birth.

N2  - An analysis of the month of birth in 210 patients with atopic dermatitis and a positive prick test towards the house dust mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus) showed a significantly higher prevalence of birth in the interval May to November when compared with the expected distribution (p less than 0.01). A subdivision of the AD patients due to the concomitant presence of asthma showed no differences as the relative risk was nearly the same in the two subgroups. This observation indicates that a consistent seasonal preference of birth in patients with atopic dermatitis only applies to the skin disease and not to coexistent asthma.

N2  - Asthma is universally accepted as a multifactorial disease. So the research of constitutional risk factors must consider multiple pathways. In non atopic asthma several rare genetic etiologies are known, others are suspected but not proved. From HAMBURGER atopic allergy is a phenotype with several mechanisms. Finally some data suggest that bronchial hyper-reactivity has a genetic part. The author reviews recent knowledge and describes his personal research. His findings reveal that HLA-B 12 is significantly linked with family history of presumed atopic respiratory disease. These data are discussed.
