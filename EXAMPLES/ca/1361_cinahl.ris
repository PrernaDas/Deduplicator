AB  - Objective: Maternal folic acid supplementation has been recommended prior to and during the first trimester of pregnancy to reduce the risk of infant neural tube defects. However, an uncertain relationship between folic acid supplementation during pregnancy and development of childhood asthma exists. Recent data show a methyl donor-rich diet could increase the risk of developing allergic airway disease through DNA methylation and aberrant gene transcription. This study evaluated the effect of folic acid supplementation during pregnancy on airway remodeling and allergic airway disease vulnerability in a mouse asthma model. Methods: BALB/c mice were divided into four groups according to gestational folic acid supplementation and postnatal ovalbumin (OVA) exposure: Group 1 (whole pregnancy folic acid supplementation + OVA-exposed group), Group 2 (first gestational week folic acid supplementation + OVA-exposed group), Group 3 (no folic acid supplementation + OVA-exposed group), and Group 4 (control group). Offspring were sacrificed on day 45 for immunohistological and ultrastructural tests. Results: In OVA challenged groups, folic acid supplementation led to a thicker epithelial and subepithelial smooth muscle layer than in the unsupplemented group. Moreover, folic acid supplementation during whole pregnancy (Group 1) was associated with a thicker epithelial and subepithelial smooth muscle layer than folic acid supplementation during the first week of pregnancy (Group 2), suggesting a duration-response relationship. Electron microscopic imaging revealed that structural changes including the loss of epithelial integrity, thickening of basement membrane, and subepithelial fibrosis were more prominent in the folic acid supplementation groups. Conclusions: This study suggested that maternal folic acid supplementation during pregnancy affects airway remodeling and increases the allergic responses induced by ovalbumin challenge in offspring. In addition, the effect size increased as the duration and cumulative dose increased.

AB  - Rationale: Little is known regarding the impact of ambient ultrafine particles (UFPs; <0.1 μm) on childhood asthma development. Objectives: To examine the association between prenatal and early postnatal life exposure to UFPs and development of childhood asthma. Methods: A total of 160,641 singleton live births occurring in the City of Toronto, Canada between April 1, 2006, and March 31, 2012, were identified from a birth registry. Associations between exposure to ambient air pollutants and childhood asthma incidence (up to age 6) were estimated using random effects Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for personal- and neighborhood-level covariates. We investigated both single-pollutant and multipollutant models accounting for coexposures to particulate matter ≤2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) and NO2. Measurements and Main Results: We identified 27,062 children with incident asthma diagnosis during the follow-up. In adjusted models, second-trimester exposure to UFPs (hazard ratio per interquartile range increase, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.12) was associated with asthma incidence. In models additionally adjusted for PM2.5 and nitrogen dioxide, UFPs exposure during the second trimester of pregnancy remained positively associated with childhood asthma incidence (hazard ratio per interquartile range increase, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.09). Conclusions: This is the first study to evaluate the association between perinatal exposure to UFPs and the incidence of childhood asthma. Exposure to UFPs during a critical period of lung development was linked to the onset of asthma in children, independent of PM2.5 and NO2.

AB  - Background: The short-term effects of particulate matter (PM) exposure on childhood asthma exacerbation and disease control rate is not thoroughly assessed in Chinese population yet. The previous toxic effects of PM exposure are either based on long-term survey or experimental data from cell lines or mouse models, which also needs to be validated by real-world evidences.Methods: We evaluated the short-term effects of PM exposure on asthma exacerbation in a Chinese population of 3106 pediatric outpatientsand disease control rate (DCR) in a population of 3344 children using case-crossover design. All the subjects enrolled are non-hospitalized outpatients. All data for this study were collected from the electronic health record (EHR) in the period between January 1, 2016 and June 30, 2018 in Xiamen, China.Results: We found that exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 within the past two weeks was significantly associated with elevated risk of exacerbation (OR = 1.049, p < 0.001 for PM2.5and OR = 1.027, p < 0.001 for PM10). In addition, exposure to PM10 was associated with decreased DCR (OR = 0.976 for PM10, p < 0.001).Conclusions: Our results suggest that exposure to both PM10 and PM2.5 has significant short-term effects on childhood asthma exacerbation and DCR, which serves as useful epidemiological parameters for clinical management of asthma risk in the sensitive population.

AB  - Background: Single birth cohort studies have been the basis for many discoveries about early life risk factors for childhood asthma but are limited in scope by sample size and characteristics of the local environment and population. The Children's Respiratory and Environmental Workgroup (CREW) was established to integrate multiple established asthma birth cohorts and to investigate asthma phenotypes and associated causal pathways (endotypes), focusing on how they are influenced by interactions between genetics, lifestyle, and environmental exposures during the prenatal period and early childhood.Methods and Results: CREW is funded by the NIH Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) program, and consists of 12 individual cohorts and three additional scientific centers. The CREW study population is diverse in terms of race, ethnicity, geographical distribution, and year of recruitment. We hypothesize that there are phenotypes in childhood asthma that differ based on clinical characteristics and underlying molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, we propose that asthma endotypes and their defining biomarkers can be identified based on personal and early life environmental risk factors. CREW has three phases: 1) to pool and harmonize existing data from each cohort, 2) to collect new data using standardized procedures, and 3) to enroll new families during the prenatal period to supplement and enrich extant data and enable unified systems approaches for identifying asthma phenotypes and endotypes.Conclusions: The overall goal of CREW program is to develop a better understanding of how early life environmental exposures and host factors interact to promote the development of specific asthma endotypes.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to estimate the national burden of school absenteeism associated with pain among 6 to 17-year-old children in the United States.Methods: Data were analyzed from a large, nationally representative sample from the 2012 National Health Interview Survey. Associations between pain and school absence were analyzed using multivariate negative binomial models controlling for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.Results: The sample contained 8641 participants, of whom 30.3% reported pain over the preceding 12 months. Mean number of parent-reported school days missed across the entire sample was 3 per child; however pain was associated with an additional 1.5 reported missed school days per child. Furthermore, pain was associated with higher rates of chronic absenteeism (missing >15 d of school): 6.1% of children with pain was chronically absent as compared with 1.3% of children without pain. Extrapolated to the nation, childhood pain in the United States was associated with 22.2 million additional days of missed school, whereas childhood asthma, in comparison, was associated with 8 million additional days of school missed.Discussion: Associations between pain and school absenteeism highlight the need for interventions aimed at improving school attendance among children with pain.

AB  - Background: Vitamin D may influence pregnancy and infant outcomes, especially infant respiratory health. This study aimed to examine vitamin D status in pregnant women with asthma, and whether higher vitamin D levels are associated with fewer adverse respiratory outcomes in their infants.Methods: Pregnant women with asthma, recruited from John Hunter Hospital Newcastle Australia (latitude 33°S), had serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin-D (25(OH)D) measured at 16 and 35 weeks gestation. Infant respiratory outcomes were collected at 12 months by parent-report questionnaire. Mother-infant dyads were grouped by serum 25(OH)D during pregnancy: 25(OH)D < 75 nmol/L (at both time-points) versus 25(OH)D ≥ 75 nmol/L (at one or both time-points).Results: In 52 pregnant women with asthma, mean serum 25(OH)D levels were 61 (range 26-110) nmol/L at 16 weeks, and 65 (range 32-116) nmol/L at 35 weeks, gestation. Thirty-one (60%) women had 25(OH)D < 75 nmol/L at both time-points; 21 (40%) had 25(OH)D ≥ 75 nmol/L at one or both time-points. Maternal 25(OH)D < 75 nmol/L during pregnancy was associated with a higher proportion of infants with "wheeze ever" at 12 months, compared with 25(OH)D ≥ 75 nmol/L (71 versus 43%, p = .04). Infant acute-care presentations (45 versus 13%, p = .02) and oral corticosteroid use (26 versus 4%, p = .03) due to "asthma/wheezing" were higher in the maternal group with 25(OH)D < 75 nmol/L, versus ≥75 nmol/L.Conclusions: Most pregnant women with asthma had low vitamin D status, which persisted across gestation. Low maternal vitamin D status was associated with greater risk of adverse respiratory outcomes in their infants, a group at high risk of developing childhood asthma.

AB  - Phenotypic variation in asthma, especially early childhood asthma, is increasingly recognized. Although inhaled corticosteroids are recommended as first-line therapy, it has less efficacy in controlling intermittent wheeze due to viral-induced symptoms in early childhood. This article reviews 2 emerging therapies in particular for early childhood wheeze: azithromycin and bacterial lysate therapy. Azithromycin's effects are both antibacterial and anti-inflammatory, and it has been shown in 2 studies in preschoolers to prevent progression to severe respiratory tract infection and decrease duration of wheeze. Bacterial lysates work at multiple stages in the innate and adaptive immune response and have been shown to decrease mean wheeze duration in particular in the preschool age. More research is required although both therapies offer a promising future approach, in particular in the nonatopic preschool wheezer, as we move toward a more personalized approach to childhood asthma.

We assessed the impact of the electronic-AsthmaTracker (e-AT), a self-monitoring application for children with asthma. METHODS: Prospective cohort study with matched controls. Participants were enrolled January 2014 to December 2015 in 11 pediatric clinics for weekly e-AT use for 1 year. Analyses included: (1) longitudinal changes for the child (QoL, asthma control, and interrupted and missed school days) and parents (interrupted and missed work days and satisfaction), (2) comparing ED and hospital admissions and oral corticosteroid (OCS) use pre- and postintervention, and (3) comparing ED and hospital admissions and OCS use between e-AT users and matched controls. RESULTS: A total of 327 children and parents enrolled; e-AT adherence at 12 months was 65%. Compared with baseline, participants had significantly (P < .001) increased QoL, asthma control, and reduced interrupted and missed school and work days at all assessment times. Compared with 1 year preintervention, they had reduced ED and hospital admissions (rate ratio [RR]: 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.49-0.95) and OCS use (RR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.61-0.91). Parent satisfaction remained high. Compared with matched controls, participants had reduced ED and hospital admissions (RR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.22-0.75) and OCS use (RR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.46-0.93). CONCLUSIONS: e-AT use led to high and sustained participation in self-monitoring and improved asthma outcomes. Dissemination of this care model has potential to broadly improve pediatric ambulatory asthma care.

AB  - As a geographic continuum of poverty and affluence has emerged, so too has a geographic continuum of good and poor health. Asthma is currently one of the most prevalent chronic childhood diseases. Over the past three decades, the greatest increases in asthma rates have been in urban areas and have disproportionately affected youth in poverty and those in racial and ethnic minority groups. Neighborhoods serve as a mechanism fostering environmental injustice and perpetuating these disparities in health outcomes and life opportunity for our most vulnerable populations. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) methods in a case study of St. Louis Missouri, this study examines local environmental risk by identifying 'hotspots,' or statistically significant spatial clustering of high or low levels of childhood asthma, and associations with neighborhood characteristics, socio-demographic characteristics, and access to healthcare resources within these hotspots. Results revealed statistically significant clustering of high asthma rates in areas with more non-White and poor residents, higher rates of public housing, deteriorating housing, and violent crime. High asthma hotspots were also located in areas with limited physical access to healthcare resources, such as physicians and medication, and lower school attendance rates. Residents of these high asthma hotspots experience greater environmental risk, and significant disparities in health and education outcomes, physical and financial healthcare resources, and overall well-being. This study demonstrates these place-based inequalities and presents clear evidence of environmental injustice, supporting the need for investments and interventions to improve the environments, health, and economic resources of our most vulnerable youth. • High asthma hotspots are associated with characteristics of environmental risk. • Environmental injustice is associated with an inequitable opportunity structure. • High asthma hotspots are associated with segregation and disparities in outcomes. • Residents of high asthma hotspots experience greater environmental risk and inequity. • Inequitable neighborhoods perpetuate environmental injustice and health disparities.

AB  - Importance: Exposure to air pollutants is a well-established cause of asthma exacerbation in children; whether air pollutants play a role in the development of childhood asthma, however, remains uncertain.Objective: To examine whether decreasing regional air pollutants were associated with reduced incidence of childhood asthma.Design, Setting, and Participants: A multilevel longitudinal cohort drawn from 3 waves of the Southern California Children's Health Study over a period of air pollution decline. Each cohort was followed up from 4th to 12th grade (8 years): 1993-2001, 1996-2004, and 2006-2014. Final follow-up for these data was June 2014. Population-based recruitment was from public elementary schools. A total of 4140 children with no history of asthma and residing in 1 of 9 Children's Health Study communities at baseline were included.Exposures: Annual mean community-level ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter less than 10 μm (PM10) and less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) in the baseline year for each of 3 cohorts.Main Outcomes and Measures: Prospectively identified incident asthma, collected via questionnaires during follow-up.Results: Among the 4140 children included in this study (mean [SD] age at baseline, 9.5 [0.6] years; 52.6% female [n = 2 179]; 58.6% white [n = 2273]; and 42.2% Hispanic [n = 1686]), 525 incident asthma cases were identified. For nitrogen dioxide, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for asthma was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.71-0.90) for a median reduction of 4.3 parts per billion, with an absolute incidence rate decrease of 0.83 cases per 100 person-years. For PM2.5, the IRR was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.67-0.98) for a median reduction of 8.1 μg/m3, with an absolute incidence rate decrease of 1.53 cases per 100 person-years. For ozone, the IRR for asthma was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.71-1.02) for a median reduction of 8.9 parts per billion, with an absolute incidence rate decrease of 0.78 cases per 100 person-years. For PM10, the IRR was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.82-1.07) for a median reduction of 4.0 μg/m3, with an absolute incidence rate decrease of 0.46 cases per 100 person-years.Conclusions and Relevance: Among children in Southern California, decreases in ambient nitrogen dioxide and PM2.5 between 1993 and 2014 were significantly associated with lower asthma incidence. There were no statistically significant associations for ozone or PM10.

AB  - Objective: To assess the influence of the trajectory of weight gain from birth to adolescence on cardiovascular and metabolic risk. We studied childhood body mass index (BMI) trajectories from birth to age 14 years and cardiometabolic risk factors at age 14 years.Study Design: In total, 410 children with weight and height measurements were assessed from birth throughout childhood, from the Childhood Asthma Prevention Study, a prospective community-based cohort. BMI trajectory groups were determined by latent basis growth mixture models. Of these subjects, 190 had detailed cardiometabolic risk factors assessed at age 14 years.Results: Three BMI trajectory groups were identified; normal BMI, "early rising" excess BMI from 2 years, and "late rising" excess BMI from 5 years. Differences were found between normal and excess BMI in children at 14 years of age. In addition, children with an early rising BMI trajectory had statistically significantly higher central adiposity and a more atherogenic lipoprotein profile at age 14 years than children with a late rising BMI trajectory (P < .05). No differences between BMI trajectory groups in vascular structure or function was identified at age 14 years.Conclusions: Earlier onset of an elevated BMI trajectory persisting from birth to age 14 years results in an unfavorable cardiometabolic risk profile at age 14 years, including central adiposity and more atherogenic lipoproteins, independent of achieved BMI.

AB  - Gene-environment (G × E) interaction is important for many complex traits. In a case-control study of a disease trait, logistic regression is the standard approach used to model disease as a function of a gene (G), an environmental factor (E), G × E interaction, and adjustment covariates. We propose an alternative model with G as the outcome and show how it provides a unified framework for obtaining results from all of the common G × E tests. These include the 1–degree-of-freedom (df) test of G × E interaction, the 2-df joint test of G and G × E, the case-only and empirical Bayes tests, and several 2-step tests. In the context of this unified model, we propose a novel 3-df test and demonstrate that it provides robust power across a wide range of underlying G × E interaction models. We demonstrate the 3-df test in a genome-wide scan of G × sex interaction for childhood asthma using data from the Children's Health Study (Southern California, 1993–2001). This scan identified a strong G × sex interaction at the phosphodiesterase gene 4D locus (PDE4D), a known asthma-related locus, with a strong effect in males (per-allele odds ratio = 1.70; P = 3.8 × 10−8) and virtually no effect in females. We describe a software program, G×EScan (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California), which can be used to fit standard and unified models for genome-wide G × E studies.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: To review the literature of the past 18 months (April 2017 through September, 2018) relating to vitamin D and childhood asthma.Recent Findings: A combined analysis of two clinical trials of maternal vitamin D supplementation trials showed a significant protective effect of vitamin D supplementation trials in the primary prevention of asthma and recurrent wheeze up to age 3 years. Secondary analyses from these trials have also suggested that initial maternal vitamin D status could affect the response to supplementation during pregnancy, with the biggest protective effect in children born to mothers with initial 25hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels of at least 30 ng/ml. A postnatal, 6-month vitamin D supplementation trial in black, premature babies showed a 34% decreased risk of recurrent wheezing at 1 year among the infants who received supplementation. An individual patient data meta-analysis of published clinical trials concluded that vitamin D supplementation decreased the risk of asthma exacerbations in those with 25OHD levels less than 10 ng/ml. Results of observational analyses on primary prevention of asthma and in prevention of exacerbations remain mixed, with the bulk of the evidence suggesting that there is a protective effect of higher vitamin D levels.Summary: Evidence continues to accumulate that vitamin D supplementation helps to prevent the development of asthma and recurrent wheeze in early life, and may also help in the management of asthma. The level(s) of circulating vitamin D that maximizes these effects remains to be identified.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: Childhood asthma is a heterogeneous disease and many children have uncontrolled disease. Therefore an individualized approach is needed to improve asthma outcomes in children. Precision medicine using clinical characteristics, biomarkers, and the rapidly involving field of genomics and pharmacogenomics aims to achieve asthma control and reduce future risks with less side-effects in individual children with asthma.Recent Findings: It is not yet possible to select treatment options on clinical characteristics. Novel monoclonal antibodies are efficacious in patients with severe, eosinophilic asthma. Reduced lung function growth and early decline is a prevalent finding in children with persistent asthma. Pharmacogenetic studies have identified children at risk for cortisol suppression when using inhaled corticosteroids.Summary: Clinical characteristics and simple biomarkers like eosinophils, IgE, and the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide may be used in clinical practice for a basic precision medicine approach, deciding which children will have the best chance to respond to inhaled corticosteroids and to the biologicals omalizumab and mepolizumab.Further application of pharmacogenomics and breathomics needs additional studies before they can be applied as tools for precision medicine in individual children with asthma.

AB  - Background: Childhood asthma is the most common respiratory disorder worldwide, being associated with increased morbidity and a decreased quality of life. Omega‐3 fatty acids have anti‐inflammatory and immunomodulating properties; however, their efficacy in asthma is controversial. The present study aimed to examine the efficacy of a Mediterranean diet supplemented with a high omega‐3 'fatty' fish intake in Greek asthmatic children. Methods: A single‐centred, 6‐month, parallel randomised controlled trial compared the consumption of a Mediterranean diet supplemented with two meals of 150 g of cooked fatty fish weekly (intervention) with the usual diet (control) with respect to pulmonary function in children (aged 5–12 years) with mild asthma. Pulmonary function was assessed using spirometry and bronchial inflammation by fractional exhaled nitric oxide analysis. Results: Sixty‐four children (52% male, 48% female) successfully completed the trial. Fatty fish intake increased in the intervention group from 17 g day−1 at baseline to 46 g day−1 at 6 months (P < 0.001). In the unadjusted analysis, the effect of the intervention was of borderline significance (P = 0.06, β = −11.93; 95% confidence interval = −24.32 to 0.46). However, after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index and regular physical activity, a significant effect was observed (P = 0.04, β = −14.15 ppb; 95% confidence interval = −27.39 to −0.91). No difference was observed for spirometry, asthma control and quality of life scores. Conclusions: A Mediterranean diet supplemented with two fatty fish meals per week might be a potential strategy for reducing airway inflammation in childhood asthma. Future robust clinical trials are warranted to replicate and corroborate these findings.

AB  - Prenatal vitamin D insufficiency may be associated with an increased risk of developing childhood asthma. Results from epidemiological studies are conflicting and limited by short follow-up and small sample sizes. The objective of this study was to examine if children born to women exposed to the margarine fortification policy with a small dose of extra vitamin D during pregnancy had a reduced risk of developing asthma until age 9 years, compared to children born to unexposed women. The termination of a Danish mandatory vitamin D fortification policy constituted the basis for the study design. We compared the risk of inpatient asthma diagnoses in all Danish children born two years before (n = 106,347, exposed) and two years after (n = 115,900, unexposed) the termination of the policy. The children were followed in the register from 0–9 years of age. Data were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression. The Hazard Ratio for the first inpatient asthma admission among exposed versus unexposed children was 0.96 (95%CI: 0.90–1.04). When stratifying by sex and age, 0–3 years old boys exposed to vitamin D fortification showed a lower asthma risk compared to unexposed boys (HR 0.78, 95%CI: 0.67–0.92). Prenatal exposure to margarine fortification policy with extra vitamin D did not affect the overall risk of developing asthma among children aged 0–9 years but seemed to reduce the risk among 0–3 years old boys. Taking aside study design limitations, this could be explained by different sensitivity to vitamin D from different sex-related asthma phenotypes in children with early onset, and sex differences in lung development or immune responses.

AB  - Background: Asthma is a syndrome composed of heterogeneous disease entities. Although it is agreed that proper asthma endo-typing and appropriate type-specific interventions are crucial in the management of asthma, little data are available regarding pediatric asthma.Methods: We designed a cluster-based, prospective, observational cohort study of asthmatic children in Korea (Korean childhood Asthma Study [KAS]). A total of 1000 Korean asthmatic children, aged from 5 to 15 years, will be enrolled at the allergy clinics of the 19 regional tertiary hospitals from August 2016 to December 2018. Physicians will verify the relevant histories of asthma and comorbid diseases, as well as airway lability from the results of spirometry and bronchial provocation tests. Questionnaires regarding subjects' baseline characteristics and their environment, self-rating of asthma control, and laboratory tests for allergy and airway inflammation will be collected at the time of enrollment. Follow-up data regarding asthma control, lung function, and environmental questionnaires will be collected at least every 6 months to assess outcome and exacerbation-related aggravating factors. In a subgroup of subjects, peak expiratory flow rate will be monitored by communication through a mobile application during the overall study period. Cluster analysis of the initial data will be used to classify Korean pediatric asthma patients into several clusters; the exacerbation and progression of asthma will be assessed and compared among these clusters. In a subgroup of patients, big data-based deep learning analysis will be applied to predict asthma exacerbation.Discussion: Based on the assumption that asthma is heterogeneous and each subject exhibits a different subset of risk factors for asthma exacerbation, as well as a different disease progression, the KAS aims to identify several asthma clusters and their essential determinants, which are more suitable for Korean asthmatic children. Thereafter we may suggest cluster-specific strategies by focusing on subjects' personalized aggravating factors during each exacerbation episode and by focusing on disease progression. The KAS will provide a good academic background with respect to each interventional strategy to achieve better asthma control and prognosis.

AB  - Background During the Pregnancy and Birth to 24 Months Project, the USDA and Department of Health and Human Services initiated a review of evidence on diet and health in these populations. Objectives The aim of these systematic reviews was to examine the relation of 1) never versus ever feeding human milk, 2) shorter versus longer durations of any human milk feeding, 3) shorter versus longer durations of exclusive human milk feeding prior to infant formula introduction, 4) feeding a lower versus higher intensity of human milk to mixed-fed infants, and 5) feeding a higher intensity of human milk by bottle versus breast with food allergies, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and asthma. Methods The Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review team conducted systematic reviews with external experts. We searched CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase, and PubMed for articles published between January 1980 and March 2016, dual-screened the results according to predetermined criteria, extracted data from and assessed the risk of bias for each included study, qualitatively synthesized the evidence, developed conclusion statements, and graded the strength of the evidence. Results The systematic reviews numbered 1–5 above included 44, 35, 1, 0, and 0 articles, respectively. Moderate, mostly observational, evidence suggests that 1) never versus ever being fed human milk is associated with higher risk of childhood asthma, and 2) among children and adolescents who were fed human milk as infants, shorter versus longer durations of any human milk feeding are associated with higher risk of asthma. Limited evidence does not suggest associations between 1) never versus ever being fed human milk and atopic dermatitis in childhood or 2) the duration of any human milk feeding and allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis in childhood. Conclusions Moderate evidence suggests that feeding human milk for short durations or not at all is associated with higher childhood asthma risk. Evidence on food allergies, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis is limited.

AB  - Background Nutrition during infancy and toddlerhood may influence health and disease prevention across the life span. Complementary feeding (CF) starts when human milk or infant formula is complemented by other foods and beverages, beginning during infancy and continuing to age 24 mo. Objectives The aim of this study was to describe systematic reviews conducted for the USDA and the Department of Health and Human Services Pregnancy and Birth to 24 Months Project to answer the following question: What is the relationship between the timing of the introduction of complementary foods and beverages (CFBs), or types and amounts of CFBs consumed, and the development of food allergy, atopic dermatitis/eczema, asthma, and allergic rhinitis? Methods The literature was searched using 4 databases (CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase, PubMed) to identify articles published from January 1980 to February 2017 that met predetermined inclusion criteria. For each study, data were extracted and risk of bias was assessed. The evidence was qualitatively synthesized to develop a conclusion statement, and the strength of the evidence was graded. Results Thirty-one included articles addressed the timing of CFB introduction, and 47 articles addressed the types and amounts of CFBs consumed. Conclusions Moderate evidence suggests that there is no relationship between the age at which CF first begins and the risk of developing food allergy, atopic dermatitis/eczema, or childhood asthma. Limited to strong evidence, depending on the specific food, suggests that introducing allergenic foods in the first year of life (after 4 mo) does not increase the risk of food allergy and atopic dermatitis/eczema but may prevent peanut and egg allergy. There is not enough evidence to determine a relationship between diet diversity or dietary patterns and atopic disease. Research is needed to address gaps and limitations in the evidence on CF and atopic disease, including research that uses valid and reliable diagnostic measures and accounts for key confounders and potential reverse causality.

AB  - Objective: To synthesize evidence on the role of microbiota in asthma pathogenesis, phenotype, and treatment outcomes, and to provide perspective on future research directions and challenges.Data Sources: Studies identified from a PubMed search, including all or some of the terms "asthma," "microbiome," "microbiota," "gut," "airway," "respiratory," "lung," "viral," and "fungal".Study Selections: Studies included and referenced based on the authors' opinion of the study design and methods, value of the research questions, and the relevance of the results to the objective of the article.Results: Many studies have demonstrated an important role for intestinal or upper airway microbiota in mediating the pathogenesis of childhood asthma. Fewer but robust studies have implicated a role for lower respiratory tract microbiota in adult asthma phenotype, including effects of treatments. Bacterial and fungal members of the respiratory microbiota are associated with and may drive specific molecular phenotypes of asthma in adults.Conclusion: Current evidence supports the role of human microbiota changes in shaping asthma risk, pathogenesis, and clinical presentation. Further understanding of how microbiota functionally mediate these aspects in clinically relevant contexts will require better integration of advanced scientific tools, analytic methods, and well-designed clinical studies. These efforts should be pursued with a systems-level perspective of the complex interactions between human hosts and their microbiomes, and the impact on these interactions of changes in environmental and lifestyle factors across the lifespan.

AB  - There is growing emphasis on using patient-reported outcome measures to enhance clinical practice. This study was a retrospective review of scores on the Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT) and the Pediatric Symptom Checklist-17 (PSC-17) at a pediatric primary care center in Boston, Massachusetts. A total of 218 patients were selected at random using billing codes for well-child (WC) care and asthma, excluding complex medical conditions. Cutoff scores were used to identify uncontrolled asthma (C-ACT ⩽19) and clinically significant psychosocial symptoms (+PSC-17). Multiple logistic regression was used to measure associations between C-ACT ⩽19 and +PSC-17, adjusting for covariates. In multivariable analysis, C-ACT ⩽19 at WC visits was associated with +PSC-17 at WC visits (adjusted odds ratio = 3.2 [95% confidence interval = 1.3-8.6]). C-ACT ⩽19 at non-WC visits was also associated with +PSC-17 at WC visits (adjusted odds ratio = 3.1 [95% confidence interval = 1.2-8.9]). Patient-reported outcome measures of asthma control and psychosocial symptoms were positively correlated in this sample.

AB  - The quality of life for the family is an important outcome of childhood asthma. The aim of the study was to describe the quality of life in families who have a child with asthma. The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Family Impact Module was completed by the parents of 527 children with asthma. The median overall score was 75.0 (interquartile range 63.9, 87.5). The following factors were independently associated with lower quality of life: additional difficulties such as anxiety and financial hardship (3.81 [2.45, 5.93]), waking with asthma symptoms one or more nights a week (odds ratio 2.53 [1.34, 4.75]), regular use of symptoms reliever medication (2.47 [1.57, 3.87]), and female gender (1.97 [1.27, 3.05]). Lower socioeconomic status of the family and exposure to molds at home doubled the odds for lower quality of life. Physician's diagnosed asthma severity and control were associated with quality of life in univariate, but not multivariate analysis.Conclusion: Multiple factors, several of which are not related to asthma, contribute to the family burden of having a child with asthma. Clinicians should be mindful of the impact of asthma on the child and the family, and consider exploring factors not directly related to childhood asthma. What is Known: • Childhood asthma as a chronic disease impacts the quality of life of the patient, but there is also an impact on the immediate family. • There are relatively few studies exploring the quality of life of parents of a child with asthma; the results are heterogeneous and none has been carried out in an Eastern European country. What is New: • This is the first study to describe caregiver's quality of life in an Eastern European population in the context of childhood asthma. • The quality of life of the family of asthmatic child depends not only on factors related to asthma, but also non-asthma related factors such as poverty which play even more important role.

AB  - Objective: Asthma is the most common chronic condition diagnosed among children worldwide according to the World Health Organization (WHO). This study evaluated on a longitudinal basis prospectively collected medical records for demographic and neonatal information among United States (US) children diagnosed with childhood asthma in comparison to controls.Design: The Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) database was examined to identify cases (n = 5907) diagnosed with International Classification of Disease, ninth revision (ICD-9) healthcare provider diagnosed childhood asthma (493.xx) and controls (n = 11,662).Patients: All cases and controls were health maintenance organization (HMO)-enrolled from birth until diagnosis or sufficient time to ensure that they were unlikely to receive a diagnosis, respectively.Main Outcome Measures: Child's gestational age in weeks at birth, birth weight in grams, maternal age in years at birth, Appearance-Pulse-Grimace-Activity-Respiration (APGAR) score at 1 minute and 5 minutes following birth, gender, and race.Results: The study results revealed childhood asthma was diagnosed significantly more frequently among males than females, and significantly more frequently among minority populations (Black > Hispanic > Native American > Asian) than White populations. Cases diagnosed with childhood asthma had significantly decreased mean values for the following neonatal risk factors: gestational age, maternal age, birth weight, and APGAR scores at 1 and 5 minutes following birth in comparison to controls.Conclusions: This study offers healthcare providers important demographic and neonatal factors significantly associated with childhood asthma, and should help aid in the early diagnosis and treatment of childhood asthma.

AB  - Pediatric asthma is a common chronic condition with wide-ranging implications for children's health, their families, and the health care system. The diagnosis may be relatively straightforward for the child with characteristic symptoms, triggers, and response to therapy, but there are other less common presentations that can make the diagnosis challenging. Diagnosing asthma in a toddler with recurrent wheezing can be particularly difficult. Treating asthma in a step-wise fashion usually reduces symptom frequency and improves asthma control. Asthma exacerbations and poor outcomes from acute exacerbations remain an area in which we have room for improvement. This article provides an overview of the diagnosis and management of childhood asthma for the primary care provider. [Pediatr Ann. 2019;48(3):e103-e109.].

AB  - Introduction: Diary-derived symptom score and rescue medication use endpoints, such as symptom-free days (SFDs) and rescue medication-free days (RFD), are frequently used as clinical trial endpoints. Estimates of meaningful change for SFDs and RFDs have not been generated in pediatric populations. This research aimed to generate evidence supporting estimates of the individual within-patient changes that constitute an important or meaningful change in SFDs, RFDs, and updated estimates on the Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT) in pediatric asthma populations aged 5-11 years.Methods: Semistructured, qualitative interviews were conducted with children (ages 8-11 years) who had asthma and parents/caregivers of children (4-11 years) with asthma. Before the interview (4-9 days) participants were asked to complete a morning and evening diary.Results: On average, parent/caregiver estimates of the difference in SFDs between a "very bad" and a "little bad" week for their children's asthma were largely concordant with the values reported by their children (differences of 1.8 and 1.4 SFDs, respectively). Both parents/caregivers and children were able to articulate what a meaningful level of change would be on the C-ACT at the item level. This qualitative study generated C-ACT item-level meaningful change estimates in the region of 1-3 category change, which potentially suggests that, if scaled up to represent C-ACT total score, this would lead to change estimates of 7-15 points.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that both children with asthma and parents/caregivers can quantitatively estimate and to some extent qualitatively articulate meaningful change in SFDs and RFDs.

AB  - Background: Asthma is a common complex chronic, inflammatory polygenic disease with heterogeneous manifestations, affecting individuals of all age groups and posing an immense burden on healthcare resources. A number of studies have identified the association between a disintegrin and metalloprotease 33 (ADAM33) polymorphisms and asthma risk, however, the results still remain inconclusive. The objective of the present study was to identify the effect of ADAM33 variants in asthma susceptibility.Methods: Eligible case-control studies published between January 2000 and June 2018 was searched and retrieved from online electronic databases. The odds ratio (OR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI) was employed to calculate the effect.Results: A total of 63 case-control studies were finally screened out, including 13,280 asthma patients and 13,340 controls. Eleven SNPs of ADAM33 gene were identified. Our results detected a significant association between ADAM33 T2, Q1, F + 1 and AA genotype of T + 1 polymorphisms and asthma risk in total population. Subgroup analysis by ethnicities showed that the alleles and genotypes of T2, Q1 and F + 1 polymorphisms were associated with asthma susceptibility among Asian populations, while V4 polymorphism was associated with asthma among Caucasian populations. Subgroup analysis by ages showed that T2, F + 1 and ST + 4 polymorphisms were associated with childhood asthma, while Q1 and V4 polymorphisms were associated with asthma risk in adults. Subgroup analysis by asthma severity showed that only the G allele of ADAM33 T1 polymorphism was associated with the severity of asthma when compared with the controls. In addition, T2, Q1 and F + 1 polymorphisms of ADAM33 were significantly associated with increased the asthma risk in Chinese asthma patients.Conclusions: Our results found that T2, Q1 and F + 1 polymorphisms of ADAM33 gene might contribute to asthma risk. Future well-designed case-control studies with large population and more ethnicities are still needed to estimate the association.

AB  - A paradigm shift brought by the recognition that childhood asthma is an aggregated diagnosis that comprises several different endotypes underpinned by different pathophysiology, coupled with advances in understanding potentially important causal mechanisms, offers a real opportunity for a step change to reduce the burden of the disease on individual children, families, and society. Data-driven methodologies facilitate the discovery of "hidden" structures within "big healthcare data" to help generate new hypotheses. These findings can be translated into clinical practice by linking discovered "phenotypes" to specific mechanisms and clinical presentations. Epidemiological studies have provided important clues about mechanistic avenues that should be pursued to identify interventions to prevent the development or alter the natural history of asthma-related diseases. Findings from cohort studies followed by mechanistic studies in humans and in neonatal mouse models provided evidence that environments such as traditional farming may offer protection by modulating innate immune responses and that impaired innate immunity may increase susceptibility. The key question of which component of these exposures can be translated into interventions requires confirmation. Increasing mechanistic evidence is demonstrating that shaping the microbiome in early life may modulate immune function to confer protection. Iterative dialogue and continuous interaction between experts with different but complementary skill sets, including data scientists who generate information about the hidden structures within "big data" assets, and medical professionals, epidemiologists, basic scientists, and geneticists who provide critical clinical and mechanistic insights about the mechanisms underpinning the architecture of the heterogeneity, are keys to delivering mechanism-based stratified treatments and prevention.

AB  - Rationale: Polymorphisms on chromosome 17q21 confer the major genetic susceptibility to childhood-onset asthma. Risk alleles positively correlate with ORMDL3 (orosomucoid-like 3) expression. The locus influences disease severity and the frequency of human rhinovirus (HRV)-initiated exacerbations. ORMDL3 is known to regulate sphingolipid synthesis by binding serine palmitoyltransferase, but its role in inflammation is incompletely understood.Objectives: To investigate the role of ORMDL3 in cellular inflammation.Methods: We modeled a time series of IL1B-induced inflammation in A549 cells, using cytokine production as outputs and testing effects of ORMDL3 siRNA knockdown, ORMDL3 overexpression, and the serine palmitoyltransferase inhibitor myriocin. We replicated selected findings in normal human bronchial epithelial cells. Cytokine and metabolite levels were analyzed by analysis of variance. Transcript abundances were analyzed by group means parameterization, controlling the false discovery rate below 0.05.Measurements and Main Results: Silencing ORMDL3 led to steroid-independent reduction of IL6 and IL8 release and reduced endoplasmic reticulum stress after IL1B stimulation. Overexpression and myriocin conversely augmented cytokine release. Knockdown reduced expression of genes regulating host-pathogen interactions, stress responses, and ubiquitination: in particular, ORMDL3 knockdown strongly reduced expression of the HRV receptor ICAM1. Silencing led to changes in levels of transcripts and metabolites integral to glycolysis. Increased levels of ceramides and the immune mediator sphingosine-1-phosphate were also observed.Conclusions: The results show ORMDL3 has pleiotropic effects during cellular inflammation, consistent with its substantial genetic influence on childhood asthma. Actions on ICAM1 provide a mechanism for the locus to confer susceptibility to HRV-induced asthma.

AB  - Purpose: We conducted the meta-analysis to respectively evaluate the risk of prenatal antibiotics use during specific trimesters (first, second, and third trimester) on childhood asthma or wheeze and to explore whether the association was biased by potential confounding.Methods: The quality of included articles was assessed according to Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale and the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology. A random effects model was used to calculate pooled risk ratios and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), and publication bias was tested by Egger statistical test.Results: Eight studies were included finally. We found a crude positive association of prenatal antibiotics use during each pregnancy trimester and risk of childhood asthma or wheeze with RRs of 1.28 (95% CI, 1.09-1.51) for the first trimester of pregnancy, 1.25 (95% CI, 1.02-1.52) for the second trimester, and 1.25 (95% CI, 1.05-1.49) for the third trimester. However, when considering potential factors of maternal infections and presence of siblings, the relationship for each trimester was insignificant.Conclusions: This systemic review and meta-analysis proposed a crude positive association between prenatal antibiotic use in every specific trimester and risk of childhood asthma or wheeze. However, adjustment for confounders decreased the relative risk estimates, supporting the concept that these associations are, at least in part, because of confounding by indication.

AB  - A 30-year-old ex-smoker with a background history of childhood asthma presented with worsening shortness of breath despite receiving high doses of oral corticosteroid for pemphigus vulgaris which was diagnosed 5 years earlier. A high-resolution CT examination of the thorax reported non-specific bronchiectatic changes and revealed an incidental suprarenal mass. A subsequent CT scan confirmed a large adrenal mass with areas of necrosis and calcification. Serum renin and aldosterone, urinary catecholamine and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were within normal limits. Surgical intervention was delayed due to difficulty in optimising preoperative respiratory functions. He finally underwent a midline laparotomy for removal of the tumour. Histopathological examinations revealed extrapulmonary inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour arising from the periadrenal soft-tissue, with presence of normal adrenal gland. He showed immediate improvements of his asthmatic symptoms and pemphigus vulgaris following the surgery. His oral steroid was rapidly reduced and he achieved complete remission 2 months later.

AB  - Indoor air pollution is associated with childhood asthma but the molecular mechanism remains unclear. We aimed to explore the relationship between indoor air pollution and pediatric asthma, and the potential molecular mechanism. The serum level of miR-155 was measured by real-time qPCR in 180 Chinese children with asthma caused by air pollution (an asthma group). Meanwhile, 180 healthy subjects were selected as a control group. HCHO, NO2, and particles (PM10, PM2.5, and PM1) were measured. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were analyzed to assess the relationship between air pollutants and asthma risk. A rank correlation test was used to explore the relationship between serum level of miR-155 and the level of PM2.5 or HCHO. Serum level of miR-155 was higher in the asthma group than the control group (p < 0.001). The history of childhood allergy, breastfeeding, environmental tobacco smoke, PM2.5, and HCHO were significantly different between two groups (p < 0.05). Serum level of miR-155 was closely associated with the levels of indoor PM2.5 and HCHO in the asthma group (p < 0.05) but not in the control group (p > 0.05). Indoor air pollution aggravates the asthma in Chinese children and induces the changes in the serum level of miR-155.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few trials have been conducted to address the psychological difficulties of parents in managing their child's asthma. Fostering parental psychological flexibility through Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) may help parents to accept these psychological difficulties and improve their management of childhood asthma. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, a 4-session, group-based ACT plus asthma education (ACT group) was compared with an asthma education talk plus 3 telephone followups (control group) to train parents of children diagnosed with asthma. The use of health care services due to asthma exacerbations in children and the psychological well-being of their parents were assessed before, immediately after, and at 6 months after the intervention. RESULTS: A total of 168 parents and their children aged 3 to 12 years with asthma were consecutively recruited in a public hospital in Hong Kong. When compared with the control group, children whose parents were in the ACT group made significantly fewer emergency department visits (adjusted 6-month incidence rate ratio = 0.20; confidence interval [CI] 0.08 to 0.53; P = .001) due to asthma exacerbations at 6 months postintervention. These parents also reported a decrease in psychological inflexibility (mean difference = 25.45; CI 27.71 to 23.30; P = .014), less anxiety (mean difference = 22.20; CI 23.66 to 20.73; P = .003), and stress (mean difference = 22.50; CI 24.54 to 20.47; P = .016). CONCLUSIONS: Integrating ACT into parental asthma education was effective at decreasing parental anxiety and stress and reducing the asthma-related emergency department visits of children at 6 months postintervention.

AB  - Background: Severe asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can be challenging to manage, particularly when the clinical features may be similar. With the increased availability of advanced therapies for both entities, it is more important than ever to diagnose and phenotype accurately to inform appropriate treatment decisions. This case highlights the use of endobronchial biopsies to allow for histological evaluation of airways disease, and in particular the role of airway smooth muscle mass as an additional biomarker that could facilitate the diagnostic process.Case Presentation: A 65 year old woman presented with a diagnosis of severe COPD on the background of previous smoking and mild childhood asthma. Despite taking maximal inhaled pharmacotherapy, she had frequent exacerbations requiring corticosteroids and remained dyspnoeic on mild exertion. Lung function tests showed severe obstruction on spirometry (forced expiratory ratio 43%, forced expiratory volume in 1 s 47% predicted), and single breath Diffusing Capacity for Carbon Monoxide was moderately reduced at 45% predicted. Computed tomography revealed hyperinflation without marked emphysema. Quantitative CT for emphysema distribution demonstrated a relatively small lung fraction of 9.35% with <- 950 Hounsfield units. Bronchoscopy with endobronchial biopsy was undertaken to further determine the underlying pathology, and airway mucosa histology was consistent with typical findings of asthma. The patient was treated with bronchial thermoplasty as she did not meet prescribing criteria for monoclonal antibodies. Six months post treatment, she had a significant improvement in symptom control and medication usage, without any exacerbations.Conclusions: Airway smooth muscle histology is an underutilised biomarker that has a valuable role in phenotyping airways disease in the era of individualised medicine.

AB  - Aim: To develop the Primary care fUnctions oF Family physicians in Childhood Asthma (PUFFinCA) scale for evaluating the cardinal process functions of primary care services (accessibility, comprehensiveness, continuity and coordination) provided by family physicians (FPs) in the management of childhood asthma. Background: In the literature on the functions of primary care, there is no assessment tool focusing on children with asthma. Primary care assessment scales adapted to various languages are not suitable to adequately address the needs of special patient groups, such as children with asthma. Methods: In this methodological study, the instrument development process was completed in four stages: establishing the pool of items, evaluating the content validity, applying the scale and statistical analysis. The scale was applied to 320 children who had asthma and received care in the clinic of the Department of Pediatrics, Division of Allergy and Pulmonology at Ege University School of Medicine, Turkey. The Cronbach's α and Spearman–Brown coefficient were calculated to determine the reliability of the scale. Principal component analysis was used to determine the construct validity of the scale. Findings: The PUFFinCA scale was found to have four-factor structure and 25 items. Cronbach's α coefficient was 0.93. It has been determined that the reliability was excellent and the item-total correlation coefficients were >0.30 each. The factors were titled FP's 'functions of accessibility, first contact and continuity', 'functions of coordination and comprehensiveness of health services related to asthma management', 'provision of preventive care related to asthma' and 'provision of services for paid vaccinations'.

AB  - Background: We aimed to explore the effects of passive smoking on the severity of pediatric asthma and associated molecular mechanisms.Methods: A total of 378 children with asthma were assigned into four groups according to asthma severity (from grades I to IV). Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to analyze possible factors associated with asthma severity in children. Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure was measured via cotinine concentration in urine. Serum levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE) and cytokines were measured using allergen diagnostic and ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) kits. The percentage of T-regulatory (Treg) and T-helper type 17 (Th17) cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) were measured by flow cytometry. Treg- and Th17-associated transcription factors from PMBCs were measured by using ELISA kits.Results: The levels of ETS and serum IgE, and the duration and amounts of passive smoking were closely associated with asthma severity. Passive smoking significantly reduced the levels of FoxP3 (Forkhead/winged helix transcription factor) and tumor growth factor-β, which were associated with Treg cells, and increased the levels of interleukin-17A and interleukin-23, which were associated with Th17 cells. Meanwhile, passive smoking significantly reduced the ratio of Treg/Th17 cells (P < 0.05).Conclusions: Passive smoking was closely associated with the severity of childhood asthma by affecting the balance of Treg/Th17 cells.

AB  - Background: Studies have shown that airway obstruction and increased bronchial reactivity are present in early life in children developing asthma, which challenges the dogma that airway inflammation leads to low lung function. Further studies are needed to explore whether low lung function and bronchial hyperreactivity are inherent traits increasing the risk of developing airway inflammation and asthmatic symptoms in order to establish timely primary preventive initiatives.Methods and Findings: We investigated 367 (89%) of the 411 children from the at-risk Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2000 (COPSAC2000) birth cohort born to mothers with asthma, who were assessed by spirometry and bronchial reactivity to methacholine from age 1 month, plethysmography and bronchial reversibility from age 3 years, cold dry air hyperventilation from age 4 years, and exercise challenge at age 7 years. The COPSAC pediatricians diagnosed and treated asthma based on symptom load, response to inhaled corticosteroid, and relapse after treatment withdrawal according to a standardized algorithm. Repeated measures mixed models were applied to analyze lung function trajectories in children with asthma ever or never at age 1 month to 13 years. The number of children ever versus never developing asthma in their first 13 years of life was 97 (27%) versus 270 (73%), respectively. Median age at diagnosis was 2.0 years (IQR 1.2-5.7), and median remission age was 6.2 years (IQR 4.2-7.8). Children with versus without asthma had reduced lung function (z-score difference, forced expiratory volume, -0.31 [95% CI -0.47; -0.15], p < 0.001), increased airway resistance (z-score difference, specific airway resistance, +0.40 [95% CI +0.24; +0.56], p < 0.001), increased bronchial reversibility (difference in change in forced expiratory volume in the first second [ΔFEV1], +3% [95% CI +2%; +4%], p < 0.001), increased reactivity to methacholine (z-score difference for provocative dose, -0.40 [95% CI -0.58; -0.22], p < 0.001), decreased forced expiratory volume at cold dry air challenge (ΔFEV1, -4% [95% CI -7%; -1%], p < 0.01), and decreased forced expiratory volume after exercise (ΔFEV1, -4% [95% CI -7%; -1%], p = 0.02). Both airway obstruction and bronchial hyperreactivity were present before symptom debut, independent of disease duration, and did not improve with symptom remission. The generalizability of these findings may be limited by the high-risk nature of the cohort (all mothers had a diagnosis of asthma), the modest study size, and limited ethnic variation.Conclusions: Children with asthma at some point at age 1 month to 13 years had airway obstruction and bronchial hyperreactivity before symptom debut, which did not worsen with increased asthma symptom duration or attenuate with remission. This suggests that airway obstruction and bronchial hyperreactivity are stable traits of childhood asthma since neonatal life, implying that symptomatic disease may in part be a consequence of these traits but not their cause.

AB  - The measurement of lung function in preschool children for the diagnosis of asthma is not routinely used. The need to perform forced expiratory manoeuvres requires active cooperation and thus limits the application of spirometry in this age group. The forced oscillation technique (FOT) is a simple and noninvasive method of assessing the mechanical properties of the respiratory system during tidal breathing. It is used in young patients and requires minimal cooperation. It provides an objective assessment of the respiratory system in a group of patients in whom we have not yet had appropriate diagnostic tools. In recent years, due to the availability of new technical solutions, FOT has been increasingly used and has a chance to become a valuable tool in diagnosing and monitoring of treatment in preschool children. This article presents the possibility of the clinical application of FOT in diagnosing and monitoring of early childhood asthma.

AB  - Rationale: Maternal asthma and preeclampsia have independently been reported to be associated with increased asthma incidence in children of affected mothers. Maternal asthma is also associated with increased risk of preeclampsia development. However, the joint effect of these maternal conditions on child asthma risk is unknown.Objectives: To study whether development of preeclampsia among pregnant women with asthma was associated with higher risk of childhood asthma in the VDAART (Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial).Methods: A total of 806 pregnant women and their offspring at high risk of asthma or atopy, who were followed from VDAART enrollment (10-18 wk of gestation) through the child's third birthday, were included in this cohort analysis. Preeclampsia status was determined by chart review, obstetrician diagnosis, and adjudication by a panel of obstetricians. Child asthma was the main outcome as determined by parental report of a physician diagnosis, and the risk of child asthma was also examined if accompanied by recurrent wheeze. The main risk variable of interest was a four-level ordered variable defined for each mother, with values without asthma without preeclampsia, without asthma with preeclampsia, with asthma without preeclampsia, and with asthma with preeclampsia during their pregnancy. We examined the trend of outcome proportions across these categories. To account for differences in maternal and child characteristics, we used a Weibull regression model for interval-censored data to compare the incidence of child asthma by age of 3 years across the maternal variable categories.Measurements and Main Results: The incidence of asthma in 3-year-old children was 9.90% (44/445), 17.95% (7/39), 22.11% (65/294), and 32.14% (9/28) among those born to mothers without asthma and without preeclampsia, mothers without asthma with preeclampsia, mothers with asthma without preeclampsia, and mothers with asthma with preeclampsia, respectively. The incidences demonstrated an increasing trend in risk of child asthma across the maternal groups (P for trend <0.001). After accounting for potential confounders and using time to report of childhood asthma as analysis outcome, risk of asthma was greater among children born to mothers with asthma without preeclampsia, compared with mothers without asthma without preeclampsia (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.46-3.26). This risk was 50% greater for children born to mothers with asthma who developed preeclampsia during pregnancy (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.68; 95% confidence interval, 1.30-5.61). The trend in asthma and recurrent wheeze proportions across the maternal groups' children also indicated a higher risk for children born to mothers with asthma with preeclampsia (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.73; 95% confidence interval, 2.20-10.07; P for trend <0.001).Conclusions: Preeclampsia is associated with increased risk of early life childhood asthma in children less than 3 years old over and above that associated with maternal asthma alone. The results implicate the interplay between maternal factors as strong predictors of offspring asthma and in utero maternal-fetal immune perturbations and developmental dysregulations associated with preeclampsia.

AB  - Rationale: Characterization of patterns of wheezing and allergic sensitization in early life may allow for identification of specific environmental exposures impacting asthma development.Objectives: To define respiratory phenotypes in inner-city children and their associations with early-life environmental exposures.Methods: Data were collected prospectively from 442 children in the URECA (Urban Environment and Childhood Asthma) birth cohort through age 7 years, reflecting symptoms (wheezing), aeroallergen sensitization, pulmonary function, and body mass index. Latent class mixed models identified trajectories of wheezing, allergic sensitization, and pulmonary function. Cluster analysis defined nonoverlapping groups (termed phenotypes). Potential associations between phenotypes and early-life environmental exposures were examined.Measurements and Main Results: Five phenotypes were identified and mainly differentiated by patterns of wheezing and allergic sensitization (low wheeze/low atopy; low wheeze/high atopy; transient wheeze/low atopy; high wheeze/low atopy; high wheeze/high atopy). Asthma was most often present in the high-wheeze phenotypes, with greatest respiratory morbidity among children with frequent wheezing and allergic sensitization. These phenotypes differentially related to early-life exposures, including maternal stress and depression, antenatal environmental tobacco smoke, house dust microbiome, and allergen content (all P < 0.05). Prenatal smoke exposure, maternal stress, and depression were highest in the high-wheeze/low-atopy phenotype. The high-wheeze/high-atopy phenotype was associated with low household microbial richness and diversity. Early-life aeroallergen exposure was low in high-wheeze phenotypes.Conclusions: Patterns of wheezing, allergic sensitization, and lung function identified five respiratory phenotypes among inner-city children. Early-life environmental exposure to stress, depression, tobacco smoke, and indoor allergens and microbes differentially associate with specific phenotypes.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: Asthma affects up to 13% of pregnancies worldwide and has a varying and unpredictable clinical course during pregnancy. Pharmacological asthma treatment is recommended; however, studies show that some pregnant women with asthma cease their medication in early pregnancy. There is likely a large unmet disease burden arising from asthma in pregnancy.Recent Findings: Antenatal and asthma guidelines lack sufficient information on asthma management in pregnant women, and implementation of the current guidelines seems inadequate. Prescription databases provide evidence of cessation of asthma medication during pregnancy on a population level. Population-based databases also provide evidence of rare adverse perinatal outcomes. The risk of childhood asthma in the offspring of women with asthma is reduced by adequate control of maternal asthma during pregnancy. Vitamin D sufficiency during pregnancy could also reduce the risk of childhood asthma.Summary: The findings of this review demonstrate the need for improved asthma and antenatal guidelines regarding asthma management during pregnancy, and the need of adequate implementation of these guidelines. Furthermore, adequate asthma control during pregnancy is needed to reduce the risk of childhood asthma. To maintain asthma control, prepregnancy medication should be continued throughout pregnancy and adjusted according to the current treatment steps if required.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: The goal of this review is to discuss strategies to prevent asthma exacerbations in children, focusing on recent advances in knowledge and understanding.Recent Findings: Asthma exacerbations are common, and their prevention is an important goal to avoid detrimental impacts such as loss of disease control and lung function and significant healthcare costs. A number of strategies have been studied as tools for prevention of asthma exacerbations. Daily inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are effective for many children with asthma. However, alternative strategies such as intermittent ICS therapy, antileukotrienes, and biologics have been studied as means to lessen corticosteroid exposure. Further, recent studies have examined add-on strategies for children not controlled with ICS alone. Finally, personalizing therapy with targeted approaches has provided significant benefit to those with moderate-severe disease.Summary: Recent research highlights many potentially effective treatment strategies to prevent asthma exacerbations in children. We have reviewed and summarized the data on treatment approaches to help provide a better understanding of the methods that can be utilized. An individualized approach with careful monitoring is essential to identify the most effective strategies to prevent asthma exacerbations in each child.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: Asthma is a common chronic disease of the airways characterized by recurrent respiratory symptoms, bronchoreactivity, and airway inflammation. The high toll on quality of life has led to sustained efforts to understand the factors leading to asthma inception and poor disease control. Obesity is another increasingly common pediatric disease, which appears to increase the risk for incident asthma and worsened disease severity. Currently, our understanding of how obesity affects asthma risk and affects its phenotypic characteristics remains incomplete. The current review describes our current understanding of the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and management considerations of obesity-related asthma in children.Recent Findings: The epidemiologic relationship between obesity in children and incident asthma remains confusing despite numerous longitudinal cohort studies, and appears to be influenced by early life exposures, patterns of somatic growth and underlying familial risks of allergic disease. Children with comorbid obesity and asthma demonstrate diverse phenotypic characteristics which are still becoming clear.Summary: Like any child with asthma, a child with comorbid obesity requires an individualized approach adhering to current best-practice guidelines and an understanding of how obesity and asthma may interact.

AB  - Abstract Childhood asthma prevalence continues to rise despite advancements in prevention and medical management strategies. The purpose of this study was to investigate correlations between urinary organic acids and pulmonary diagnostic tests, asthma control in Greek asthmatic children. We hypothesized that urinary organic acids are positively associated with poor pulmonary function in children with asthma. Seventy-two children, 5 to 12 years old with asthma were recruited from a pediatric asthma clinic in Athens, Greece. Pulmonary function was assessed using spirometry and exhaled nitric oxide analysis. Asthma control was measured qualitatively using the Asthma Control Questionnaire. Targeted metabolomic analysis of 34 urinary organic acids in children was conducted by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. A statistically significant difference between girls and boys was found for asthma control score (P =.02), lactic acid (P =.03), but not for any other organic acids (P >.05). Statistically significant correlations were found between lactic acid and Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV 1) (P =.02), Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) (P =.03); 4- hydroxyphenylacetic acid and FEV 1 (P =.01), FVC (P =.01); 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and FEV 1 /FVC (P =.03), eNO (P =.05); glycolic acid with Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) (P =.03); and malic acid with asthma control (P =.02). In conclusion, metabolomics was used to determine correlations between urinary organic acids and conventional pulmonary diagnostic tests in Greek asthmatic children. Metabolomics could be a promising approach for asthma research and in detection of novel biomarkers for asthma monitoring and therapeutic targets for childhood asthma. This study contributes towards a better understanding of the biochemical pathways involved in asthma.

AB  - Background: The international guidelines recognize that the treatment of asthma focuses both on the current control and the risk of exacerbations, based on the management of symptoms which advocate an objective assessment. The Childhood Asthma Control Test (c-ACT) tool allows an assessment of the control of asthma in children and is used in Portugal, but has no validation. Objective: To evaluate the psychometric properties of the c-ACT tool for the Portuguese population. Methodology: A methodo ogical, quantitative, and transversal study, on a sample of 60 children and healthcare providers, for the analysis of the psychometric properties of a measuring tool, written in Portuguese. The internal consistency was evaluated by Cronbach's alpha, and the factorial validity and reliability of the model were analyzed using exploratory factorial analysis. Results: The tool showed internal consistency, with a Cronbach alpha of 0.716. There are statistically significant correlations between each item and the overall evaluation. Conclusion: The c-ACT tool demonstrated good psychometric properties, giving validity and reliability for use in the Portuguese population.

AB  - Abstract Anecdotal and descriptive evidence has led to the claim that some low-income households may face a "eat or breathe" tradeoff, but quantitative evidence is scarce. We link Medicaid claims data to monthly Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) participation data from the state of Missouri from 2010 to 2013 to explore monthly patterns in children's emergency room (ER) claims for asthma and to examine whether these patterns are sensitive to the timing and amount of SNAP benefits. This allows us to empirically test whether SNAP households with Medicaid insurance face trade-offs between food and medicine that increases the likelihood that a child in a SNAP and Medicaid household will go to the ER for asthma at the end of the month. While we do not find overwhelming evidence that the timing of SNAP benefits receipt are associated with the timing of asthma-related ER visits, we do find clear evidence that increased SNAP benefits are associated with a reduction in the overall probability of an asthma-related ER visit. Highlights • Previous evidence suggests that households may face a "eat or breathe" tradeoff. • The timing of SNAP benefits is not associated with ER visits for childhood asthma. • Higher SNAP benefits are associated with a reduction in ER visits for childhood asthma.

AB  - Background: Asthma is one of the major chronic diseases in the pediatric population affecting 9.5% of children. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommends the use of the Childhood-Asthma Control Test or the Asthma Control Test for periodic assessment of asthma control as one of the four validated instruments. Despite the recommendation from the national guidelines, research has shown adherence to the guidelines is suboptimal. Purpose: The purpose of this evidence-based project was to implement the Childhood-Asthma Control Test or the Asthma Control Test screening tools into the primary care practice to improve management of patients with asthma by more accurately addressing asthma control. The anticipated outcomes of this project were improved identification of asthma control from the patient and/or family's perspective in accordance with the national guidelines and optimization of asthma management based upon the level of control. Methods: The Iowa Model-Revised: Evidence-Based Practice to Promote Excellence in Health Care was used to guide this evidence-based project. An educational program was devised and presented to the providers and nursing staff of the clinic. A systematic change was implemented. The project was a pre and post implementation study comparing two different groups of patients with asthma seen at the clinic over five-week periods. Results: Prior to implementation, only 1 APRN had used a single Asthma Control Test. After the implementation of the educational program and project, 82.6% of APRNs and 30.7% of pediatric resident physicians utilized an Asthma Control Test resulting in identification of 9 (21%) patients who were considered not well-controlled. All (100%) of those children identified as not well-controlled through the Asthma Control Test received an adjustment in their medication therapy and one child was referred to pulmonary medicine for further evaluation. Conclusion: The C-ACT and ACT are simple, self-administered, validated questionnaires that can easily be incorporated into a primary care practice to assess the level of asthma control and to identify patients with asthma that is not well controlled.

AB  - Childhood asthma is a profound public health concern, making it imperative for school nurses to be knowledgeable of the condition. However, few studies have examined the relationship between school nurses' asthma knowledge and self-efficacy and demographic factors. A descriptive, quantitative, correlational research design was used to collect data using the Asthma Knowledge Survey for School Nurses and the Asthma Self-Efficacy Survey for School Nurses. A purposive sample of 121 school nurses was analyzed to determine relationships between school nurses' asthma knowledge and self-efficacy and (a) level of education, (b) years of experience, (c) school type, and (d) location. The correlation between knowledge and self-efficacy was significant, positive, and moderate. There were no significant, two-way interactions among the demographic variables. Private school nurses scored significantly lower on knowledge than did public school nurses. As school nurses' education increased, there were significantly higher knowledge scores and higher perceptions of self-efficacy. The significant predictors of knowledge were type of degree (LPN and RN) and location of school (rural). The significant predictor of self-efficacy was type of degree (LPN); however, the proportions of variance in knowledge and self-efficacy were low, indicating that, in this sample, significant predictors of knowledge and self-efficacy are still unknown. As a professional discipline, school nursing is often overlooked when it comes to research, despite the fact that services provided by school nurses can facilitate the continuum of care for students and create valuable safety net support in many communities. Augmenting understanding of factors that lead to increased asthma knowledge and higher levels of self-efficacy of school nurses will contribute substantially to the current body of information about the clinical profession of school nursing.

AB  - A School-Based Asthma Education Program to Reduce Absenteeism by Jamie Lloyd According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one in thirteen people have a diagnosis of asthma (2017). Childhood asthma is one of the leading chronic diseases affecting children below the age of eighteen years (CDC, 2017). Despite having medical advances and medications in the field of asthma, the disease remains the significant cause of school absenteeism. This study describes the planning, implementation, and results of a clinical scholarly project, which implemented a school-based asthma education program among middle school students' with a purpose to increase asthma control and reduce school absenteeism. The research design of this project was a pre- and post-intervention study and examined the effectiveness of the school-based program on the knowledge of managing asthma among the student adolescents. Attendance rates were also reviewed pre- and post-intervention. The data collection method, target population, sample size, instrumentation, variables, and the findings will be discussed. The paper also details the limitations of the project, the significance and implications, application to Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Essentials (American Association of Colleges of Nursing [AACN], 2006), sustainability and dissemination of the study findings.

AB  - Background: When mouth breathing becomes habitual, it can cause sleep disorders and abnormal maxillofacial growth, thus early detection of habitual mouth breathing is important. We created a questionnaire for early detection of habitual mouth breathing using a score based on a spectrum of factors found to be characteristic of mouth breathers. Methods: First, a draft 50-question questionnaire was given to 101 random dental clinic patients, classified by dental professionals into habitual mouth breathers (n = 28) and nose breathers (n = 73). The 10 questions that significantly differentiated mouth and nose breathers (p < 0.05) were identified from this questionnaire. These questions, regarding nasal obstruction, open mouth at rest, awareness of mouth breathing, gum swelling and dental staining of the front teeth, bad breath, maxillary protrusion, nasal obstruction in childhood, bottle-feeding, and history of asthma, formed the basis for a second questionnaire. This second survey was completed by another 242 participants, separately classified into mouth breathing (n = 26), suspected mouth breathing (n = 40), and nose breathing groups (n = 176). Results: Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of the resulting mouth breathing habit scores, representing the responses to the 10-question survey, showed moderate checklist diagnosability. Sensitivity of cut-off values was 61.5% (specificity 92.0%) for the mouth-breathing group, and 77.5% (specificity 56.3%) for the suspected mouth-breathing group. Information was also obtained from visual assessment of maxillofacial characteristics. We found that the mouth-breathing and suspected mouth-breathing groups showed significantly high odds ratios for 7 items: discomfort while breathing and increased chin muscle tonus with lip closure, maxillary protrusion, tongue thrust, open mouth at rest, open bite, and childhood asthma. For 94.6% of the nose breathing group, ≥1 of these items applied. Conclusions: These findings were then used together to create a sample screening form. We believe that screening of this kind can facilitate more accurate diagnosis of habitual mouth breathing and contribute to its early detection.

AB  - Nationally, racial and ethnic disparities in childhood asthma plateaued from 2005 to 2013. We assessed trends in childhood asthma in Miami, Florida using Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) data and emergency department (ED) utilization and hospitalization rates by zip code population characteristics. Asthma prevalence in Miami did not vary significantly by race/ethnicity in YRBSS respondents in 2005 (16.2-17.2%, all groups), but rose in African-Americans and Hispanics and declined in Whites by 2013 to 27.9, 20.9 and 12.6%, respectively (P = 0.02). Median asthma ED visit rates rose from 106.8 (2006-2008) to 138.2 (2011-2013; P = 0.004) per 10,000 children. High-poverty and majority African-American zip codes were 6.3 and 7.3 times more likely to have asthma ED visit rates > 200 than others (P < 0.001). In high-poverty zip codes, majority African-American population was not associated with significantly higher ED utilization. In low-poverty zip codes, the association became stronger. Greater poverty explains much, but not all of Miami African-Americans’ higher asthma risk.

AB  - Objective: Asthmatic children who develop obesity through adolescence have poorer disease outcomes compared with those who do not. This study aimed to characterize the biology of childhood asthma complicated by adult obesity.Methods: Gene expression networks are powerful statistical tools for characterizing human disease that leverage the putative coregulatory relationships of genes to infer relevant biological pathways. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis of gene expression data was performed in whole blood from 514 adult asthmatic subjects. Then, module preservation and association replication analyses were performed in 418 subjects from two independent asthma cohorts (one pediatric and one adult).Results: A multivariate model was identified in which three gene coexpression network modules were associated with incident obesity in the discovery cohort (each P < 0.05). Two module memberships were enriched for genes in pathways related to platelets, integrins, extracellular matrix, smooth muscle, NF-κB signaling, and Hedgehog signaling. The network structures of each of the obesity modules were significantly preserved in both replication cohorts (permutation P = 9.999E-05). The corresponding module gene sets were significantly enriched for differential expression in subjects with obesity in both replication cohorts (each P < 0.05).Conclusions: The gene coexpression network profiles thus implicate multiple interrelated pathways in the biology of an important endotype of asthma with obesity.

AB  - Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) in pediatric patients is less common than in adults. Tall, thin adolescent males are most commonly affected. While clinical guidelines exist for the adult population, evidence-based recommendations for management of this condition by major respiratory and pediatric societies are lacking. Apparent causes of spontaneous pneumothorax are usually not easily recognized, leading to erroneous classification. Secondary causes must be evaluated carefully before the term PSP is used, as pneumothorax may be a presenting sign for a number of different disorders. Childhood asthma, for example, may be associated with severe hyperinflation, even despite normal spirometry in some situations, which can lead to air leak syndromes, including both pneumothorax and/or pneumomediastinum. In this report, we seek to present a concise review of the current literature, review our own institutional experience with the management of pediatric PSP, and provide insight into the role that asthma may play in pediatric secondary spontaneous pneumothorax.

AB  - Background: Recurrent wheeze (RW) is frequent in preschool children. Wheezing phenotypes, asthma predictive index (API), and modified API (mAPI) have been described for clinical purposes. Our aim was to examine whether inflammatory markers including serum angiopoietin (Ang)-1, Ang-2, and periostin levels differ according to wheezing phenotypes and mAPI. Materials and Methods: Ninety-eight children who were <4 years of age with history of at least 4 episodes of wheezing during the past 12 months and 51 age-matched healthy controls were included in the study. Children with RW were classified according to wheezing phenotypes as episodic viral wheeze or multitrigger wheeze, and positive or negative mAPI. Blood for Ang-1, Ang-2, and periostin levels was drawn during wheezing episode-free periods. Results: Atopic children with RW (31.4 ± 34.4 ng/mL) demonstrated higher serum Ang-1 levels than nonatopic children (16.5 ± 13.8 ng/mL) with RW (P = 0.03). When we compared children according to wheezing phenotypes, we could not find any difference in serum Ang-1, Ang-2, and periostin levels between groups. Children with positive mAPI showed similar Ang-1, Ang-2, and periostin levels with children having negative API and healthy children. Conclusions: We have found higher serum Ang-1 levels in atopic children with RW, and this result might be explained by increased inflammation. The evidence was not strong enough to associate serum Ang-1, Ang-2, or periostin and asthma in preschool children with RW. However, Ang-1 can be a candidate for investigating its role in predicting atopic children and diagnosing atopic childhood asthma.

AB  - To investigate correlation between fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels and efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids in children with bronchial asthma. Between October 2013 and December 2014, 133 cases of children with bronchial asthma were randomly divided into the glucocorticoid group (n = 67; inhaled with Seretide/Pulmicort) and the nonglucocorticoid group (n = 66; inhaled with short-acting β2 receptor agonist if needed); and alternatively 72 cases of healthy children were regarded as the control group. FeNO, forced expiratory volume in 1 second to predicted value, forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity, induced sputum eosinophils (EOS)%, and total serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E and serum EOS% were detected and childhood asthma control test (C-ACT) scale was investigated pretreatment and 3 and 6 months posttreatment, respectively. FeNO levels, induced sputum EOS%, total serum IgE, and serum EOS% were significantly lower, whereas forced expiratory volume in 1 second to predicted value, forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity, and C-ACT scores were obviously improved in the glucocorticoid group 6 months posttreatment compared with those of pretreatment (all P < 0.05). FeNO levels, induced sputum EOS%, and total serum IgE were significantly lower, whereas C-ACT scores were significantly higher in the glucocorticoid group compared with those of the nonglucocorticoid group (all P < 0.05). In the glucocorticoid group, induced sputum EOS% and total serum IgE showed significantly positive correlations with FeNO levels (r = 0.73, P < 0.01; r = 0.56, P < 0.01), whereas C-ACT scores were negatively correlated with FeNO levels (r = -0.67, P < 0.01). FeNO levels might be correlated with efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids in children with bronchial asthma.

AB  - Childhood asthma is a complex disease which may be resistant to treatment and varies in its clinical presentation. The number of children admitted to emergency departments (EDs) with acute exacerbation of asthma is high and many are managed solely in the department. The correct assessment of the severity of an exacerbation can be achieved through competent history taking, examination and accurate recording of observations. Nurses working in EDs should be able to recognise the clinical signs and symptoms of acute asthma, assess severity and advise on appropriate management. Nurses should have some knowledge of first-line management and how and when to help deliver these therapies. They should also be able to guide patients in discharge and follow-up care, develop a rapport with families and educate them on topics such as trigger avoidance. The assessment and management of these patients as outlined in this article is based on the British Thoracic Society/Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (2016).

AB  - Resumen Introducción El asma es una enfermedad respiratoria caracterizada por ataques recurrentes de disnea y sibilancias, los cuales varían en cuanto a severidad y frecuencia de una persona a otra. A pesar de ser una enfermedad frecuente en la población infantil, en nuestra región no se han registrado suficientes estudios acerca del tema. El objetivo fue identificar algunos factores relacionados con el desarrollo del asma en la infancia, en un grupo de niños de 6 a 14 años en 2 colegios de la ciudad de Cali. Método Estudio transversal. Se recolectó información por medio del cuestionario de los estudios ISAAC. Este cuestionario fue diligenciado por los cuidadores de los niños de entre 6 y 14 años. Resultados De 1.273 encuestas enviadas a cuidadores, se analizaron 324; para esta población el 80% de los niños se encontraban entre los 6-11 años de edad, de los cuales el 57% eran niñas, el 54% pertenecían a un estrato socioeconómico medio y el 50% eran de raza mestiza. Para esta población la prevalencia del asma fue del 24%. Entre los 12 y los 14 años la prevalencia fue mayor (45%) y también fue mayor en niños. Entre los factores relacionados se encuentran: a mayor edad es mayor la prevalencia de asma, las enfermedades anteriores del niño como la bronquiolitis, los factores ambientales como fumar en casa y la calidad inadecuada del suelo. Conclusiones La prevalencia del asma en niños fue del 23,8%. La edad del niño, el antecedente de bronquiolitis y fumar en casa son factores relacionados con el asma infantil. Abstract Introduction Asthma is a respiratory disease, characterised by recurrent attacks of dyspnoea and wheezing, which vary in severity and frequency from one person to another. Despite being a common disease in children in our region, not enough studies have been conducted on the subject. The aim of this study was to identify some factors related to the development of asthma in childhood, in a group of children from 6 to 14 years old in 2 schools in the city of Cali. Method A cross-sectional study was performed by collecting information using the questionnaire of the ISAAC phase II studies. This questionnaire was completed by the caregivers of the 6 to 14 year-old schoolchildren. Results A total of 1273 questionnaires were sent to caregivers. Of the 324 analysed, 80% of the children were between 6 to 11 years of age, of whom 57% were girls. Just over half (54%) were of medium socioeconomic status, and 50% claimed to be of mixed race. The prevalence of asthma for this population was 23.8%, being higher in ages from 12 to 14 years with 45%, and higher in boys. It was found that the prevalence was associated with the age of the child and previous illnesses, such as asthma and bronchiolitis, as well as environmental factors such as smoking at home and inadequate soil quality. Conclusions The prevalence of asthma was 23.8%. The age of the children, history of bronchiolitis, and smoking at home are factors related to childhood asthma.

AB  - Background: Bronchial asthma is one of the top disabling diseases in pediatrics. Limited research has been studied the association of the widely used plastic monomer bisphenol A (BPA) with childhood asthma. Objective: To compare the levels of urinary BPA in asthmatic and control children and to investigate the implication of BPA among other risk factors for the development of asthma. Subjects and methods: This case–control study included 97 children (45 asthmatic and 52 healthy controls) aged 3–8 years. Asthmatic children were diagnosed according to Global initiative for asthma (GINA) guidelines. Sociodemographic factors were assessed and urinary levels of BPA were determined in spot urine samples using high-performance liquid chromatography. The contribution of BPA among predictors for developing asthma was studied in asthmatic children. Results: Median total urinary BPA levels were significantly higher in asthmatic children than in control group (1.56 ng/mL in asthmatic children compared to 0.790 ng/mL in control group, p = 0.001). Children who had total urinary BPA levels >1.3 ng/mL were more likely to be asthmatic (odds ratio: 2.84, 95% confidence interval 1.22–6.59, p = 0.015). Multiple logistic regression analysis for predictors of asthma showed the importance of higher levels of BPA (>1.3 ng/mL) as a more significant predictor than passive smoking (p = 0.006 for BPA categories vs. p = 0.049 for passive smoking). Conclusion: Association of higher levels of urinary BPA with the diagnosis of asthma in children may indicate the potential risk of BPA exposure in the precipitation of bronchial asthma. Further clinical and biochemical research are needed to clarify the proper mechanism explaining this association.

AB  - Abstract Introduction There is a growing body of research analyzing the relationships between neighborhood safety and children's asthma prevalence and control. There are several inconsistencies in concepts and methods that have led to mixed results. The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate the current evidence analyzing neighborhood safety and childhood asthma and identify nursing research and policy implications. Method An integrative review was conducted by searching the PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsychINFO databases to identify peer-reviewed articles published between 2010-2017. Fourteen studies met inclusion criteria. Results Overall, there was evidence pointing to associations among neighborhoods being unsafe and higher asthma prevalence and/or poorer asthma control. Discussion The association between neighborhood safety and children's asthma warrants further research with universal definitions for neighborhood safety and multi-level modelling. The review also supports the "Health in All Policies" approach as safety is one of several social determinants of health that influence children's asthma.

AB  - Objectives: The project Seoul Atopy ∙ Asthma-friendly School investigated the current status of childhood asthma to enable formulation of a preventative policy. We evaluated the current prevalence of childhood asthma in Seoul and its trends and related factors.Methods: The project was conducted annually from 2011 to 2016 and involved around 35 000 children aged 1-13 years. Based on the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood guidelines, the survey involved parents. The associations of the particulate matter (PM10) concentration, and the number of days on which the daily air quality guidance level was exceeded in the 25 districts of Seoul, with the prevalence of asthma were assessed.Results: The age-standardized asthma prevalence in 2011 and 2016 was 6.74 and 4.02%, respectively. The prevalence of lifetime asthma treatment and treatment during the last 12 months tended to decrease from 2011 to 2016. Asthma treatment was significantly correlated with the number of days on which the daily air quality guidance level was exceeded, but not with the PM10 concentration.Conclusions: This study reports the prevalence of asthma among children in Seoul and confirmed the relationship between childhood asthma and known risk factors in a large-scale survey.

AB  - Probiotics may have immunomodulatory effects. However, these effects in asthma remain unclear and warrant clinical trials. Here, we evaluated the effects of Lactobacillus paracasei (LP), Lactobacillus fermentum (LF), and their combination (LP + LF) on the clinical severity, immune biomarkers, and quality of life in children with asthma. This double-blind, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial included 160 children with asthma aged 6–18 years (trial number: NCT01635738), randomized to receive LP, LF, LP + LF, or a placebo for 3 months. Their Global Initiative for Asthma–based asthma severity, Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT) scores, Pediatric Asthma Severity Scores, Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire scores, peak expiratory flow rates (PEFRs), medication use, the levels of immune biomarkers (immunoglobulin E (IgE), interferon γ, interleukin 4, and tumor necrosis factor α) at different visits, and the associated changes were evaluated. Compared with the placebo group by generalized estimating equation model, children receiving LP, LF, and LP + LF had lower asthma severity (p = 0.024, 0.038, and 0.007, respectively) but higher C-ACT scores (p = 0.005, < 0.001, and < 0.001, respectively). The LP + LF group demonstrated increased PEFR (p < 0.01) and decreased IgE levels (p < 0.05). LP, LF, or their combination (LP + LF) can aid clinical improvement in children with asthma.

AB  - Background: Numerous studies indicate caesarean delivery is associated with childhood asthma. Sex-specific associations were reported in four of these studies, and in all four studies, the estimated association between caesarean delivery and asthma was of greater magnitude among girls, although most report a lack of evidence of multiplicative interaction.Methods: We assessed potential effect modification by sex, on the additive and multiplicative scales, of the association between caesarean delivery and asthma by ages 2 through 6 in up to 17 075 racially diverse children from a retrospective birth cohort, the Kaiser Air Pollution and Pediatric Asthma (KAPPA) Study. We also conducted a random-effects meta-analysis, combining our sex-stratified results (using the odds ratio for compatibility with previous studies) with previously published results.Results: Adjusted risk differences for caesarean delivery and asthma in the KAPPA cohort were higher among girls than boys at every follow-up age. By age 5, caesarean delivery was associated with an absolute 3.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.4%, 7.3%) higher asthma risk among girls and a 1.9% (95% CI -1.7, 5.4) higher risk among boys. The summary odds ratio from the meta-analysis for caesarean delivery and asthma among girls was 1.26 (95% CI 1.14, 1.39) and 1.08 (95% CI 0.98, 1.20) among boys (P = 0.036).Conclusions: Higher, but imprecise, estimates for females across five studies should motivate investigators to estimate sex-specific associations for caesarean delivery and asthma and to explore biological mechanisms or sex-dependent biases that could explain this possible heterogeneity.

AB  - Background: Childhood asthma is strongly influenced by genetics and is a risk factor for reduced lung function and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults. This study investigates self-reported childhood asthma in adult smokers from the COPDGene Study. We hypothesize that childhood asthma is associated with decreased lung function, increased risk for COPD, and that a genome-wide association study (GWAS) will show association with established asthma variants.Methods: We evaluated current and former smokers ages 45-80 of non-Hispanic white (NHW) or African American (AA) race. Childhood asthma was defined by self-report of asthma, diagnosed by a medical professional, with onset at < 16 years or during childhood. Subjects with a history of childhood asthma were compared to those who never had asthma based on lung function, development of COPD, and genetic variation. GWAS was performed in NHW and AA populations, and combined in meta-analysis. Two sets of established asthma SNPs from published literature were examined for association with childhood asthma.Results: Among 10,199 adult smokers, 730 (7%) reported childhood asthma and 7493 (73%) reported no history of asthma. Childhood asthmatics had reduced lung function and increased risk for COPD (OR 3.42, 95% CI 2.81-4.18). Genotype data was assessed for 8031 subjects. Among NHWs, 391(7%) had childhood asthma, and GWAS identified one genome-wide significant association in KIAA1958 (rs59289606, p = 4.82 × 10- 8). Among AAs, 339 (12%) had childhood asthma. No SNPs reached genome-wide significance in the AAs or in the meta-analysis combining NHW and AA subjects; however, potential regions of interest were identified. Established asthma SNPs were examined, seven from the NHGRI-EBI database and five with genome-wide significance in the largest pediatric asthma GWAS. Associations were found in the current childhood asthma GWAS with known asthma loci in IL1RL1, IL13, LINC01149, near GSDMB, and in the C11orf30-LRRC32 region (Bonferroni adjusted p < 0.05 for all comparisons).Conclusions: Childhood asthmatics are at increased risk for COPD. Defining asthma by self-report is valid in populations at risk for COPD, identifying subjects with clinical and genetic characteristics known to associate with childhood asthma. This has potential to improve clinical understanding of asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) and enhance future research into ACO-specific treatment regimens.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00608764 (Active since January 28, 2008).

AB  - Objective: To review the literature regarding the effects of caregiver depression on childhood asthma and integrate the findings into a multilevel model of pathways by which these effects occur to further the understanding of the complex biopsychosocial nature of childhood asthma and the key role that is played by caregiver depression.Data Sources: PubMed was searched for articles published from 2007 to the present (10-year search), and Google Scholar was searched for articles published in 2017 and 2018 to identify the most recent publications.Study Selections: Studies selected were recent, empirical, or meta-analytic, conducted in humans, and had specific relevance to one or more of the identified pathways. Articles published before 2007 were included if deemed essential because they addressed key pathways, for which there were no more recent articles.Results: Review of the literature substantiates that caregiver depression plays a key role in the socioeconomic, familial, psychological, and biological cascade of effects on childhood asthma. Childhood asthma outcomes are affected indirectly by socioeconomic status and family stress mediated by caregiver depression, which affects disease management, and/or stress and depression in the child, which, in turn, affect asthma through alterations in immune modulation and autonomic regulation.Conclusion: Findings indicate that future research should concentrate on mediators and moderators to further clarify the complex interplay of these factors that affect childhood asthma. The findings also have substantial translational implications. Given that child stress and depression contribute to asthma disease activity and that treating caregiver depression improves child stress and depression, there is strong rationale for treating depressed caregivers of children with asthma as a component means of improving childhood asthma control.

AB  - Background: Clinical significance of small airway obstruction in mild pediatric asthma is unclear.Objective: To evaluate small airway properties in children with mild to moderate asthmatic symptoms and the association of small airway function with asthma control and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB).Methods: Children (5-10 years old) with recurrent wheezing (n = 42) or persistent troublesome cough (n = 16) and healthy controls (n = 19) performed impulse oscillometry (IOS), spirometry, and a multiple-breath nitrogen washout (MBNW) test. Exhaled nitric oxide (NO) was measured at multiple flow rates to determine alveolar NO concentration (Calv). Asthma control was evaluated with the Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT), short-acting β2-agonist (SABA) use within the past month, and asthma exacerbations within the past year.Results: IOS, spirometry, and exhaled NO indexes that are related to small airway function differed between children with recurrent wheezing and healthy controls, whereas only forced expiratory flow at 25% to 75% of the forced vital capacity was associated with persistent cough. The MBNW indexes showed no difference between the groups. Among symptomatic children, conducting airway ventilation inhomogeneity and Calv were associated with asthma exacerbations (P = .03 and P = .002, respectively), and lung clearance index and Calv were associated with EIB (P = .04 and P = .004, respectively). None of the proposed small airway indexes was associated with the C-ACT score or SABA use.Conclusion: Subtle changes were observed in the proposed small airway indexes of IOS, spirometry, and exhaled NO among children with mild to moderate recurrent wheezing. Small airway dysfunction, expressed as ventilation inhomogeneity indexes and Calv, was also associated with asthma exacerbations and EIB.

AB  - Purpose: We sought to examine the association between childhood asthma and self-reported maternal smoking during pregnancy (MSDP) after adjusting for a range of exposure misclassification scenarios using a Bayesian approach that incorporated exposure misclassification probability estimates from the literature.Methods: Self-reported MSDP and asthma data were extracted from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-2012. The association between self-reported MSDP and asthma was adjusted for exposure misclassification using a Bayesian bias model approach.Results: We included 3074 subjects who were 1-15 years of age, including 492 asthma cases. The mean (SD) of age of the participants was 8.5 (4.1) and 7.1 (4.2) years and the number (percentage) of female was 205 (42%) and 1314 (51%) among asthmatic and nonasthmatic groups, respectively. The odds ratio (OR) for the association between self-reported MSDP and asthma in logistic regression adjusted for confounders was 1.28 (95% confidence interval: 0.92, 1.77). In a Bayesian analysis that adjusted for exposure misclassification using external data, we found different ORs between MSDP and asthma by applying different priors (posterior ORs 0.90 [95% credible interval {CRI}: 0.47, 1.60] to 3.05 [95% CRI: 1.73, 5.53] in differential and 1.22 [CRI 95%: 0.62, 2.25] to 1.60 CRI: 1.18, 2.19) in nondifferential misclassification settings.Conclusions: Given the assumptions and the accuracy of the bias model, the estimated effect of MSDP on asthma after adjusting for misclassification was strengthened in many scenarios.

AB  - Rationale: The prevalence of childhood asthma has been increasing worldwide in parallel with childhood obesity.Objectives: We investigated whether there is a temporal relationship between early life weight gain (reflecting growth velocity) and early life body mass index (BMI) attained status (reflecting accumulative weight) with future risk of asthma in the Boston Birth Cohort.Methods: This report includes 1,928 children from the Boston Birth Cohort with a mean age of 7.8 years (standard deviation, 3.3 yr), enrolled at birth and followed prospectively. Asthma was defined using physician diagnosis code (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code 493.xx) in children 2 years and older. We categorized the children by their weight gain trajectory on the basis of changes in z-scores: slow (less than -0.67), on track (-0.67 to 0.67), rapid (0.67-1.28), and extremely rapid (>1.28); and by their BMI attained status (underweight, normal weight, and overweight) during the first 4, 12, and 24 months. Poisson regression models with robust variance estimation were applied to examine the relationship between early life weight gain/attained BMI and asthma.Results: During the first 4 months of life, 37% had on-track weight grain, 22% had slow weight gain, 15% had rapid weight gain, and 26% had extremely rapid weight gain. At 4 months, 61% were normal weight, 7% were underweight, and 32% were overweight. In adjusted analyses, extremely rapid early life weight gain during the first 4 and 24 months of life were each associated with increased risks of asthma (risk ratio, 1.34 for extremely rapid weight gain at 4 months; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-1.70; risk ratio, 1.32 for extremely rapid weight gain at 24 months; 95% CI, 1.00-1.75) Similarly, overweight at 4, 12, and 24 months were each associated with an increased risk of asthma. Analyses that further adjusted for birthweight or preterm birth showed similar findings.Conclusions: In this predominantly urban U.S. low-income minority birth cohort, excessive early life weight gain and overweight status were both associated with an increased risk of asthma in childhood.

AB  - To describe the role of breathing exercises or yoga and/or pranayama in the management of childhood asthma. We conducted an updated literature search and retrieved relevant literature on the role of breathing exercises or yoga and/or pranayama in the management of childhood asthma. We found that the breathing exercises or yoga and/or pranayama are generally multi-component packaged interventions, and are described as follows: Papworth technique, Buteyko technique, Yoga and/or Pranayam. These techniques primarily modify the pattern of breathing to reduce hyperventilation resulting in normalisation of CO2 level, reduction of bronchospasm and resulting breathlessness. In addition they also change the behaviour, decrease anxiety, improve immunological parameters, and improve endurance of the respiratory muscles that may ultimately help asthmatic children. We found 10 clinical trials conducted in children with asthma of varying severity, and found to benefit children with chronic (mild and moderate) and uncontrolled asthma, but not acute severe asthma. Breathing exercises or yoga and/or pranayama may benefit children with chronic (mild and moderate) and uncontrolled asthma, but not acute severe asthma. Before these techniques can be incorporated into the standard care of asthmatic children, important outcomes like quality of life, medication use, and patient reported outcomes need to be evaluated in future clinical trials.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to quantify the associations of both hyperbilirubinemia and phototherapy with childhood asthma using a population-based cohort with total serum bilirubin (TSB) levels. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of infants born at ≥35 weeks' gestation in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California health system (n = 109 212) from 2010 to 2014. Cox models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for a diagnosis of asthma. RESULTS: In the study, 16.7% of infants had a maximum TSB level of ≥15 mg/dL, 4.5% of infants had a maximum TSB level of ≥18 mg/dL, and 11.5% of infants received phototherapy. Compared with children with a maximum TSB level of 3 to 5.9 mg/L, children with a TSB level of 9 to 11.9 mg/dL, 12 to 14.9 mg/dL, and 15 to 17.9 mg/dL were at an increased risk for asthma (HR: 1.22 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11--1.3], HR: 1.18 [95% CI: 1.08--1.29], and HR: 1.30 [95% CI: 1.18--1.43], respectively). Children with a TSB level of ≥18 mg/dL were not at an increased risk for asthma (HR: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.90--1.20). In propensity-adjusted analyses, phototherapy was not associated with asthma (HR: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.96--1.20). CONCLUSIONS: Modest levels of hyperbilirubinemia were associated with an increased risk of asthma, but an association was not seen at higher levels. No dose-response relationship was seen. Using phototherapy to prevent infants from reaching these modest TSB levels is unlikely to be protective against asthma.

AB  - Over 2 million children in the US have uncontrolled asthma. African American children are disproportionately affected with a risk of dying from asthma that is 7.6 times higher than non‐Hispanic White children. Racial disparities in childhood asthma are partially attributed to differential exposures to poverty; unsafe and stressful neighborhoods; and unhealthy physical environments. This paper describes the protocol for an ongoing National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Nursing Research‐funded descriptive, cross‐sectional study to investigate two neighborhood factors that may influence children's asthma. Building on an existing dataset, this study examines associations among neighborhood greenspace, neighborhood safety, and level of asthma control while controlling for indoor asthma triggers in an urban sample of predominantly low‐income, African American children with persistent asthma. Two new variables are added to the dataset: availability of neighborhood greenspace and neighborhood violent crime rate. Greenspace is being accessed using geographic information systems and measured using the normalized difference vegetation index. Neighborhood violent crime rate is calculated using geocoded, point locations for crimes downloaded from the city police department. It is hypothesized that parents living in unsafe neighborhoods are likely to keep their children indoors, thereby increasing their children's exposure to indoor asthma triggers and limiting the potential benefits of neighborhood greenspace. The biggest challenges thus far are related to limited variability in greenspace and violent crime rates. Progress to date and strategies to address these challenges are discussed. Results have the potential to inform interventions to improve asthmatic children's health and influence public health policy.

AB  - Objective The objective of this study was to investigate whether maternal bronchial asthma increases the risk for long-term respiratory morbidity of the offspring. Study Design A population-based cohort study compared the incidence of long-term pediatric hospitalizations due to respiratory disease of the offspring of mothers with and without bronchial asthma. Deliveries occurred between the years 1991 and 2014 in a tertiary medical center. Congenital malformations as well as multiple pregnancies were excluded. Kaplan-Meier's survival curve was used to estimate cumulative incidence of respiratory morbidity. A multivariate generalized estimating equation (GEE) logistic regression model analysis was used to control for confounders. Results During the study period, 253,808 deliveries met the inclusion criteria; of which 1.3% were born to mothers with bronchial asthma (n = 3,411). During the follow-up period, children born to women with bronchial asthma had a significantly higher rate of long-term respiratory morbidity (odds ratio [OR] = 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-1.7; p < 0.001). Specifically, the rate of childhood asthma was higher among offspring of mothers with asthma (OR = 2.3; 95% CI = 1.8-2.9; p < 0.001). Children born to women with asthma had higher cumulative incidence of respiratory morbidity, using a Kaplan-Meier's survival curve (log-rank test; p < 0.001). Using two multivariable GEE logistic regression models, controlling for the time to event, maternal age, and gestational age at delivery, maternal bronchial asthma was found to be an independent risk factor for long-term respiratory disease of the offspring (adjusted OR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.4-1.9; p < 0.001), and specifically for bronchial asthma (adjusted OR = 2.5; 95% CI = 1.9-3.1; p < 0.001). Conclusion Maternal bronchial asthma is an independent risk factor for long-term respiratory morbidity of the offspring.

AB  - Childhood asthma is a complex disease which may be resistant to treatment and varies in its clinical presentation. The number of children admitted to emergency departments (EDs) with acute exacerbation of asthma is high and many are managed solely in the department. The correct assessment of the severity of an exacerbation can be achieved through competent history taking, examination and accurate recording of observations. Nurses working in EDs should be able to recognise the clinical signs and symptoms of acute asthma, assess severity and advise on appropriate management. Nurses should have some knowledge of first-line management and how and when to help deliver these therapies. They should also be able to guide patients in discharge and follow-up care, develop a rapport with families and educate them on topics such as trigger avoidance. The assessment and management of these patients as outlined in this article is based on the British Thoracic Society/Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network ( 2016 ).

AB  - Asthma is a major pediatric respiratory morbidity requiring long-term management. A thorough knowledge of long-term medication side-effects in children is, thus, essential for every physician dealing with childhood asthma. Establishing diagnosis and initiating treatment is just a beginning of the journey. Ongoing monitoring is an essential component of comprehensive asthma management programme. Monitoring includes not only assessment of asthma control but also checking for adherence to treatment, technique of inhaler device use, associated co-morbities, if any, and potential environmental exposure. Various tools - both subjective and objective - are available for assessment of asthma control. However, evidence for their optimum use in different settings and patient groups is lacking and monitoring has to be customized depending on available resources and individual patient characteristics. Patient education is an important component of long-term asthma therapy. The ultimate aim is to achieve optimum asthma control i.e., achieve and maintain control of clinical symptoms, decrease future risk to patients (risk of exacerbations, progressive loss of lung function and development of fixed airflow obstruction, adverse effects of medications) and enabling the child to lead a life without restrictions, at lowest possible dose of drugs. This article reviews the side-effects of medications used for long-term management of asthma and discusses current literature on asthma monitoring and dose titration in pediatric population to help the asthma therapist not only prescribe the drugs rationally but also help the family make right choices for treatment.

AB  - Asthma still causes considerable morbidity and mortality globally and minimal improvement has been seen in key outcomes over the last decade despite increasing treatment costs. This review summarizes recent advances in the management of asthma in children and adolescents. It focuses on the need for personalized treatment plans based on heterogenous asthma pathophysiology, the use of the terminology 'asthma attack' over exacerbation to instill widespread understanding of severity, and the need for every attack to trigger a structured review and focused strategy. The authors discuss difficulties in diagnosing asthma, accuracy and use of Fractional exhaled nitric oxide both as second line test and as a method to monitor treatment adherence or guide the choice of pharmacotherapy. The authors discuss acute and long-term management of asthma. Asthma treatment goals are to minimize symptom burden, prevent attacks and (where possible) reduce risk and impact of progressive pathophysiology and adverse outcomes. The authors discuss pharmacological management; optimal use of short acting β2 agonists, long acting muscarinic antagonist (tiotropium), use of which is relatively new in pediatrics, allergen specific immunotherapy, biological monoclonal antibody treatment, azalide antibiotic azithromycin, and the use of vitamin D. They also discuss electronic monitoring and adherence devices, direct observation of therapy via mobile device, temperature controlled laminar airflow device, and the importance of considering when symptoms may actually result from dysfunctional breathing rather than asthma.

AB  - Aim: To systematically review the effects of probiotics supplementation in children with asthma.Methods: An electronic search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, CQ VIP Database and Wanfang Data until November 2017. The reference lists of included studies and pertinent reviews were checked for supplementing our search. Randomised control trials that compared probiotics versus placebo were included.Results: Eleven studies with a total of 910 children met eligibility criteria. The pooled data revealed that the proportion of children with fewer episodes of asthma was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the control group (risk ratio 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-1.59); the reduction of IL-4 (mean differences -2.34, 95% CI -3.38, -1.29) and the increasing of interferon-γ (mean differences 2.5, 95% CI 1.23-3.76) was also significant after the treatment of probiotics. Nevertheless, no statistical significance was observed in childhood asthma control test, asthmatic symptom in the day and night, the number of symptom-free days, forced expiratory volume in the first second predicted and peak expiratory flow.Conclusions: This systematic review does not confirm or rule out the beneficial effects of probiotics supplementation in children with asthma. More well-designed randomised control trials with larger sample sizes need to be conducted to evaluate the effects of probiotics in children with asthma in the future.

AB  - Objective: The study set out to investigate socio-economic, biomedical, health and behavioural and psychological factors in childhood and adulthood associated with the prevalence of asthma in adulthood, drawing data from The National Child Development Studies (NCDS), a birth cohort in the UK. Design: The National Child Development Study, a nationally representative sample of 17,415 babies born in Great Britain in 1958 and followed up at 7, 11, 33 and 50 years was used. Main Outcome Measure: The prevalence of asthma at age 50 was the outcome measure. The analytic sample consists of 5118 participants with complete data on a set of measures at birth, at ages 7, 11, 33 and 50 years. Results: Using logistic regression analyses, results showed that childhood asthma (OR = 6.77: 4.38-10.48, p < .001) and respiratory symptoms (OR = 1.83: 1.18-2.86, p < .01), maternal smoking during pregnancy (OR = 1.26: 1.00-1.59, p < .05), Body and Mass Index (BMI) (OR = 1.03: 1.02-1.05, p < .001), traits Neuroticism (OR = 1.13: 1.01-1.21, p < .05) and Conscientiousness (OR = 0.76: 0.76-0.96, p < .01), as well as sex (OR = 1.49: 1.15-1.94, p < .001) were all significantly associated with the prevalence of asthma in adulthood. Conclusion: The study shows that both childhood and adulthood psychological and sociological factors are significantly associated with the prevalence of asthma in adulthood, though more work need to be done in this area.

AB  - Background: Increasing evidence shows that antibiotic use in pregnancy may increase the risk of childhood asthma but epidemiologic studies are still limited and findings are inconsistent. Meanwhile, exclusive and prolonged breastfeeding may prevent children from allergic diseases. We aimed to assess the association between prenatal antibiotic use and the risk of childhood asthma, and explore whether breastfeeding modifies the risk.Methods: We conducted a case-control study in Shanghai, China, from June 2015 to January 2016. A total of 634 asthma cases and 864 controls aged 3-12 years were included. Multiple logistic regressions were used to estimate crude and adjusted odds ratios (aOR).Results: The prevalence of antibiotic use in pregnancy in the cases and controls was 7.1 and 3.5%, respectively. A significant association between prenatal antibiotic use and childhood asthma was observed (aOR: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.0-2.9), particularly in boys (aOR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.1-4.4) and children with family history of allergic disorders (aOR: 3.1, 95% CI: 1.2-8.4). However, this association existed only in children who were not breastfed exclusively in the first six months of life (aOR 2.6, 95% CI 1.3-5.1) but not in children who were exclusively breastfed (aOR 0.9, 95% CI 0.4-2.1). Likewise, exclusive breastfeeding also decreased the association between antibiotic use in pregnancy and asthma in boys and in children with family histories of allergic diseases.Conclusions: Antibiotic use in pregnancy was a risk factor for childhood asthma. However, this risk may be attenuated by exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months of life, especially among high-risk children.

AB  - Objective: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and asthma share inheritable IgE-related pathophysiology, but the association between maternal SLE and asthma in the offspring has not been explored. Our aim was to investigate the association between maternal SLE during pregnancy and childhood asthma and examine the role of preterm birth as a mediator of the association using Swedish register data.Methods: Information on 12,000 singleton live births (2001-2013) was collected from the Medical Birth Register. Childhood asthma was defined as at least 1 International Classification of Diseases-coded visit in the National Patient Register. Prevalent maternal SLE at delivery was identified from the Medical Birth Register and the National Patient Register. Risk ratios for asthma were estimated while controlling for confounders. Mediation analysis was used to estimate what percentage of the total effect can be explained by preterm birth (defined as either <34 or <37 weeks of gestation).Results: We compared 775 children born to mothers with SLE with 11,225 born to mothers without SLE. Ninety seven children of mothers with SLE (13%) were diagnosed with asthma, compared to 1,211 in the unexposed group (11%). The risk ratio for childhood asthma was 1.46 (95% confidence interval 1.16-1.84). In mediation analysis, 20-29% of the total effect of SLE was explained by preterm birth.Conclusion: Prevalent maternal SLE during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of asthma in the offspring. While preterm birth can explain a fair proportion of this association, additional unidentified mechanisms also likely play a role.

AB  - Background: Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to an increased risk of asthma. This study aimed to quantify the effect of early life vitamin D status on asthma and wheeze later in life.Methods: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and CNKI databases, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Google Scholar were searched up to July 2017. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies with vitamin D level in blood (maternal or cord or infant) or intake (maternal intake during pregnancy or infant intake) and asthma and/or wheeze. Two reviewers independently extracted data. Fixed- and random-effects models were used to summarize the risk estimates of comparisons between highest vs. lowest vitamin D categories.Results: Of the 1485 studies identified, three RCTs and 33 cohort studies were included. We did not include the RCTs (1619 participants) in the meta-analysis as the comparators and outcome definitions were heterogenous. Three RCTs reported a non-statistically significant effect of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy on offspring wheeze/asthma at 3 years of age. Pooled estimates of cohort studies suggest no association between antenatal blood vitamin D levels or vitamin D intake and offspring asthma assessed either > 5 years or ≤ 5 years. The estimate for blood vitamin D remained unchanged when two studies assessing asthma in adulthood were excluded, but a significant inverse association emerged between vitamin D intake and childhood asthma. We found no association between antenatal vitamin D level and wheeze. On the other hand, vitamin D intake during pregnancy may have a protective effect against wheeze.Conclusions: The pooled estimates from cohort studies show no association between antenatal blood vitamin D level and asthma/wheeze in later life. Whereas, the pooled estimates from cohort studies suggest that antenatal vitamin D intake may have an effect on childhood asthma > 5 years or childhood wheeze. The inconsistent results from studies assessing vitamin D either in blood or intake may be explained by previously reported non-linear association between blood vitamin D3 and childhood asthma. Further trials with enough power and longer follow-up time should be conducted to confirm the results.

AB  - We conducted a needs assessment to develop an evidence-based, locally tailored asthma care implementation plan for high-risk children with asthma in Chicago. Our team of health policy experts, clinicians, researchers, and designers included extensive stakeholder engagement (N = 162) in a mixed-methods community needs assessment. Results showed the lines of communication and collaboration across sectors were weak; caregivers were the only consistent force and could not always manage this burden. A series of recommendations for interventions and how to implement and measure them were generated. Cooperative, multidisciplinary efforts grounded in the community can target wicked problems such as asthma.

AB  - We present an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis of an evidence-based childhood asthma intervention (Community Healthcare for Asthma Management and Prevention of Symptoms [CHAMPS]) to usual management of childhood asthma in community health centers. Data used in the analysis include household surveys, Medicaid insurance claims, and community health center expenditure reports. We combined our incremental cost-effectiveness analysis with a difference-in- differences multivariate regression framework. We found that CHAMPS reduced symptom days by 29.75 days per child-year and was cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio: $28.76 per symptom-free days). Most of the benefits were due to reductions in direct medical costs. Indirect benefits from increased household productivity were relatively small.

AB  - Background: Circulating microRNAs have shown promise as non-invasive biomarkers and predictors of disease activity. Prior asthma studies using clinical, biochemical and genomic data have not shown excellent prediction of exacerbation. We hypothesized that a panel of circulating microRNAs in a pediatric asthma cohort combined with an exacerbation clinical score might predict exacerbation better than the latter alone.Methods: Serum samples from 153 children at randomization in the Childhood Asthma Management Program were profiled for 754 microRNAs. Data dichotomized for asthma exacerbation one year after randomization to inhaled corticosteroid treatment were used for binary logistic regression with miRNA expressions and exacerbation clinical score.Results: 12 of 125 well-detected circulating microRNAs had significant odd ratios for exacerbation with miR-206 being most significant. Each doubling of expression of the 12 microRNA corresponded to a 25-67% increase in exacerbation risk. Stepwise logistic regression yielded a 3-microRNA model (miR-146b, miR-206 and miR-720) that, combined with the exacerbation clinical score, had excellent predictive power with a 0.81 AUROC. These 3 microRNAs were involved in NF-kβ and GSK3/AKT pathways.Conclusions: This combined circulating microRNA-clinical score model predicted exacerbation in asthmatic subjects on inhaled corticosteroids better than each constituent feature alone.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00000575 .

AB  - Background: Although it is well established that family-centered education is critical to managing childhood asthma, the information needs of parents of children with asthma are not being met through current educational approaches. Patient-driven educational materials that leverage the power of the storytelling and the arts show promise in communicating health information and assisting in illness self-management. However, such arts-based knowledge translation approaches are in their infancy, and little is known about how to develop such tools for parents. This paper reports on the development of "My Asthma Diary" - an innovative knowledge translation tool based on rigorous research evidence and tailored to parents' asthma-related information needs.Methods: We used a multi-stage process to develop four eBook prototypes of "My Asthma Diary." We conducted formative research on parents' information needs and identified high quality research evidence on childhood asthma, and used these data to inform the development of the asthma eBooks. We established interdisciplinary consulting teams with health researchers, practitioners, and artists to help iteratively create the knowledge translation tools.Results: We describe the iterative, transdisciplinary process of developing asthma eBooks which incorporates: (I) parents' preferences and information needs on childhood asthma, (II) quality evidence on childhood asthma and its management, and (III) the engaging and informative powers of storytelling and visual art as methods to communicate complex health information to parents. We identified four dominant methodological and procedural challenges encountered during this process: (I) working within an inter-disciplinary team, (II) quantity and ordering of information, (III) creating a composite narrative, and (IV) balancing actual and ideal management scenarios.Conclusions: We describe a replicable and rigorous multi-staged approach to developing a patient-driven, creative knowledge translation tool, which can be adapted for use with different populations and contexts. We identified specific procedural and methodological challenges that others conducting comparable work should consider, particularly as creative, patient-driven knowledge translation strategies continue to emerge across health disciplines.

AB  - Prenatal maternal psychosocial stress might influence the development of childhood asthma. Evaluating paternal psychosocial stress and conducting a sibling comparison could provide further insight into the role of unmeasured confounding. We examined the associations of parental psychosocial stress during and after pregnancy with asthma at age 7 years in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (n = 63,626; children born in 2000-2007). Measures of psychosocial stress included lifetime major depressive symptoms, current anxiety/depression symptoms, use of antidepressants, anxiolytics, and/or hypnotics, life satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, work stress, and social support. Childhood asthma was associated with maternal lifetime major depressive symptoms (adjusted relative risk (aRR) = 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.09, 1.30), in addition to symptoms of anxiety/depression during pregnancy (aRR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.29) and 6 months after delivery (aRR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.28). Maternal negative life events during pregnancy (aRR = 1.10, 95%CI: 1.06, 1.13) and 6 months after delivery (aRR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.11, 1.18) were also associated with asthma. These associations were not replicated when evaluated within sibling groups. There were no associations with paternal psychosocial stress. In conclusion, maternal anxiety/depression and negative life events were associated with offspring asthma, but this might be explained by unmeasured maternal background characteristics that remain stable across deliveries.

AB  - Rationale: Childhood asthma has shown variable associations with children's physical activity. Neighborhood walkability captures community features that promote walking and is protective against some chronic conditions, such as obesity and diabetes.Objectives: We evaluated associations between home neighborhood walkability and incident and ongoing childhood asthma.Methods: In this population-based cohort study, we used prospectively collected administrative healthcare data for the Province of Ontario housed at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences. We followed an administrative data cohort of 326,383 Toronto children born between 1997 and 2003, inclusive, until ages 8-15 years. Home neighborhood walkability quintile was measured using a validated walkability index with four dimensions: population density, dwelling density, access to retail and services, and street connectivity. Incident asthma was defined by time of entry into the validated Ontario Asthma Surveillance Information System database, which requires two outpatient visits for asthma within two consecutive years or any hospitalization for asthma and follows children with asthma longitudinally starting at any age. Associations between walkability and incident asthma were examined using Cox proportional hazards models. Associations between ongoing asthma and walkability in each year of life were examined using generalized linear mixed models.Results: Twenty-one percent of children (n = 69,628) developed incident asthma and were followed longitudinally in the Ontario Asthma Surveillance Information System database. Low birth home neighborhood walkability was associated with an increased incidence of asthma (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.14). Among children with asthma, low walkability in a given year of a child`s life was associated with greater odds of ongoing asthma in the same year (odds ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.14).Conclusions: Children living in neighborhoods with low walkability were at increased risk of incident and ongoing asthma. Neighborhood walkability improvement, such as by adding pedestrian paths to improve street connectivity, offers potential strategies to contribute to primary asthma prevention.

AB  - Rationale: Navajo children living on the reservation have high rates of asthma prevalence and severity. Environmental influences may contribute to asthma on the Navajo Nation and are inadequately understood.Objectives: We performed a comprehensive, integrative literature review to determine the environmental factors that may contribute to increased asthma prevalence and severity among Navajo children living on the reservation.Methods: A systematic search was conducted in four databases regarding the environmental risk factors for asthma in Navajo children living on the reservation. Relevant studies between 1990 and 2017 were examined. Nonexperimental literature was also integrated into the review to describe the environmental injustices that have historically, disproportionately, and systematically affected the Navajo people, thus contributing to respiratory disparities among Navajo children.Results: Eight studies met inclusion criteria for systematic review; however, limited research regarding environmental risk factors specific to asthma and Navajo children living on the reservation was identified. Our integrative review indicated both indoor and outdoor environmental risk factors commonly found on the Navajo reservation appear to be important determinants of asthma.Conclusions: Future research should examine indoor and outdoor air pollution from wood-burning stoves and cook stoves, coal combustion, tobacco and traditional ceremonial smoke, diesel exhaust exposure from long bus rides, indoor allergens, ambient pollutants, and regional dusts. Comprehensive mitigation efforts created in partnership with the Navajo Nation are necessary to address less-recognized risk factors as well as the common risk factors known to contribute to increased childhood asthma prevalence and severity.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the prevalence of hypomagnesemia in children with mild persistent asthma and to correlate the serum magnesium levels with symptom control in the above children.Methods: It was a cross sectional study carried out from 1st April 2015 to 31st July 2016 at the department of Pediatrics, JIPMER Hospital. Participants included six to 12-y-old children with mild persistent asthma registered at childhood asthma clinic. Pulmonary function tests were done in all children using Care fusion Jaeger spirometer. Symptom control was assessed by childhood asthma control test questionnaire and the asthma control test questionnaire (ACT) score. Serum magnesium was measured using photometric method. Proportion of children with well controlled, partially controlled and poorly controlled asthma, serum magnesium levels across the three levels of control and correlation of serum magnesium level with ACT score and pulmonary function tests were studied.Results: The prevalence of hypomagnesemia in children with mild persistent asthma was 5.6%. The median serum magnesium level was 2.0 mg/dl (IQR 1.9-2.1 mg/dL). As assessed by the ACT score, 66% had well controlled, 23% had partially controlled and 11% had poorly controlled asthma. There was no significant difference in the serum magnesium levels in the above three groups. There was no significant correlation between serum magnesium levels and ACT score as well as pulmonary function tests.Conclusions: The prevalence of hypomagnesemia in the index study is much lower than earlier studies and there seems to be no significant association between serum magnesium levels and asthma symptom control.

AB  - Policy Points: The Pay for Success (PFS) financing approach has potential for scaling the implementation of evidence‐based prevention interventions in Medicaid populations, including a range of multicomponent interventions for childhood asthma that combine home environment risk mitigation with medical case management. Even though this type of intervention is efficacious and cost‐saving among high‐risk children with asthma, the main challenges for implementation in a PFS context include legal and regulatory barriers to capturing federal Medicaid savings and using them as a source of private investor repayment. Federal‐level policy change and guidance are needed to support PFS financing of evidence‐based interventions that would reduce expensive acute care among Medicaid enrollees. Context: Pay for Success has emerged as a potential financing mechanism for innovative and cost‐effective prevention programs. In the PFS model, interventions that provide value to the public sector are implemented with financing from private investors who receive a payout from the government only if the metrics identified in a performance‐based contract are met. In this nascent field, little has been written about the potential for and challenges of PFS initiatives that produce savings and/or value for Medicaid. Methods: In order to elucidate the basic economics of a PFS intervention in a Medicaid population, we modeled the potential impact of an evidence‐based multicomponent childhood asthma intervention among low‐income children enrolled in Medicaid in Detroit. We modeled outcomes and a comparative benefit‐cost analysis in 3 risk‐based target groups: (1) all children with an asthma diagnosis; (2) children with an asthma‐related emergency department visit in the past year; and (3) children with an asthma‐related hospitalization in the past year. Modeling scenarios for each group produced estimates of potential state and federal Medicaid savings for different types or levels of investment, the time frames for savings, and some overarching challenges. Findings: The PFS economics of a home‐based asthma intervention are most viable if it targets children who have already experienced an expensive episode of asthma‐related care. In a 7‐year demonstration, the overall (undiscounted) modeled potential savings for Group 2 were $1.4 million for the federal Medicaid and $634,000 for the state Medicaid programs, respectively. Targeting children with at least 1 hospitalization in the past year (Group 3) produced estimated potential savings of $2.8 million to federal Medicaid and $1.3 million to state Medicaid. However, current Medicaid rules and regulations pose significant challenges for capturing federal Medicaid savings for PFS payouts. Conclusions: A multicomponent intervention that provides home remediation and medical case management to high‐risk children with asthma has significant potential for PFS financing in urban Medicaid populations. However, there are significant administrative and payment challenges, including the limited ability to capture federal Medicaid savings and to use them as a source of investor repayment. Without some policy reform and clear guidance from the federal government, the financing burden of PFS outcome payments will be on the state Medicaid program or some other state‐level funding source.

AB  - Asthma is a heterogeneous disease with multiple phenotypes. Epidemiologic studies suggest a close relationship between vitamin E and the occurrence of asthma, wheezing and atopic conditions during childhood. Previous results on its effects have been conflicting. The aim of this meta-analysis was to critically examine the current evidence on the association of vitamin E with childhood asthma and wheezing. We searched electronic databases for observational studies in English-language journals published from 2000 to 2016. The initial search found 420 titles; nineteen studies were eligible according to the abstracts and details, which included reporting asthma or wheeze as an outcome. None of the articles included in this meta-analysis reported side effects of vitamin E supplementation during pregnancy. This meta-analysis found that vitamin E supplementation during pregnancy influenced the risk of asthma. To better understand the effectiveness and safety of vitamin E in children with asthma, large-scale, well-designed and randomized controlled trials are needed.

AB  - Childhood asthma represents a heterogeneous challenging disease, in particular in its severe forms. The identification of different asthma phenotypes has stimulated research in underlying molecular mechanisms, such as the endotypes, and paved the way to the search for related specific biomarkers, which may guide diagnosis, management, and predict response to treatment. A limited number of biomarkers are currently available in clinical practice in the pediatric population, mostly reflecting type 2-high airway inflammation. The identification of biomarkers of childhood asthma is an active area of research that holds a potential great clinical utility and may represent a step forward toward tailored management and therapy: the so-called Precision Medicine. The aim of the present review is to provide an updated overview of asthma endotyping, mostly focusing on novel noninvasive biomarkers in childhood asthma.

AB  - Summary: Background: Obesity is a risk factor for asthma. However, it is unclear if increased obesity prevalence contributed to rising childhood asthma prevalence. Objective: To assess if population‐level changes in weight status impacted asthma prevalence over time. Methods: Using nationally representative 1988–2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data for 40 644 children aged 2–19 years, we analyzed asthma trends by weight status (body mass index age‐specific percentiles determined using measured weight and height). Logistic regression and population attributable fraction were used to assess the association between obesity and asthma prevalence. Results: Although obesity was a risk factor for asthma throughout the period, asthma prevalence increased only among children with normal weight; there was no interaction between weight status and time. The population attributable fraction for overweight/obesity rose from 8.5% in 1988–1994 to 11.9% in 2011–2014, but this increase was not significant (P = 0.44). Conclusions: Together, these data do not support a contribution of obesity trends to asthma prevalence trends.

AB  - Background: There are critical gaps in our understanding of the temporal relationships between metabolites and subsequent asthma development. This is the first study to examine metabolites from newborn screening in the etiology of early childhood wheezing.Methods: One thousand nine hundred and fifty one infants enrolled between 2012 and 2014 from pediatric practices located in Middle Tennessee in the population-based birth cohort study, the Infant Susceptibility to Pulmonary Infections and Asthma Following RSV Exposure Study (INSPIRE), were linked with metabolite data from the Tennessee Newborn Screening Program. The association between the levels of 37 metabolites and the number of wheezing episodes in the past 12 months was assessed at 1, 2, and 3 years of life.Results: Several metabolites were significantly associated with the number of wheezing episodes. Two acylcarnitines, C10:1 and C18:2, showed robust associations. Increasing levels of C10:1 were associated with increasing number of wheezing episodes at 2 years (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.41-3.17) and 3 years (OR 2.56, 95% CI 1.59-4.11), while increasing levels of C18:2 were associated with increasing number of wheezing episodes at 1 year (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.12-1.71) and 2 years (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.17-1.84).Conclusions: Identification of specific metabolites and associated pathways involved in wheezing pathogenesis offer insights into potential targets to prevent childhood asthma morbidity.

AB  - Asthma has been the most common chronic disease in children that places a major burden for affected people and their families.An integrated analysis of microarrays studies was performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in childhood asthma compared with normal control. We also obtained the differentially methylated genes (DMGs) in childhood asthma according to GEO. The genes that were both differentially expressed and differentially methylated were identified. Functional annotation and protein-protein interaction network construction were performed to interpret biological functions of DEGs. We performed q-RT-PCR to verify the expression of selected DEGs.One DNA methylation and 3 gene expression datasets were obtained. Four hundred forty-one DEGs and 1209 DMGs in childhood asthma were identified. Among which, 16 genes were both differentially expressed and differentially methylated in childhood asthma. Natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity pathway, Jak-STAT signaling pathway, and Wnt signaling pathway were 3 significantly enriched pathways in childhood asthma according to our KEGG enrichment analysis. The PPI network of top 20 up- and downregulated DEGs consisted of 822 nodes and 904 edges and 2 hub proteins (UBQLN4 and MID2) were identified. The expression of 8 DEGs (GZMB, FGFBP2, CLC, TBX21, ALOX15, IL12RB2, UBQLN4) was verified by qRT-PCR and only the expression of GZMB and FGFBP2 was inconsistent with our integrated analysis.Our finding was helpful to elucidate the underlying mechanism of childhood asthma and develop new potential diagnostic biomarker and provide clues for drug design.

AB  - Objective: In most cases of asthma, wheezing symptoms start in early childhood. Although there are studies evaluating the factors that play a role in the development of childhood asthma, the predictive markers for frequent wheezing in early childhood are still unclear. The aim of our study was to investigate the relation between the wheezing episodes and the familial, prenatal, and postnatal risk factors, and the sensitivity of serum eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) and eosinophil levels for predicting frequent wheezing. Materials and Methods: Fifty-seven children with acute wheezing and fifty healthy children aged between 1-36 months were included in the study. The children who had ≥ 3 episodes of wheezing in the next year after presentation were classified as the frequent wheezing group and those with fewer episodes were classified as the infrequent wheezing group. Administration of a comprehensive questionnaire about risk factors for wheezing; blood sampling for serum total IgE, ECP, eosinophil count, food and inhaled specific IgE levels and RSV/adenovirus serology; and skin prick tests were performed. Oral provocation tests were applied in cases of suspected food allergy. Results: Male gender (p=0.024), low socioeconomic level (p=0.046), initiation of milk formula (p=0.009) and eggs (p=0.018) before the fourth month, the presence of mold / humidity at home (p=0.023), eczema (p<0.001), and atopy (p=0.017) rates were significantly higher in the frequent wheezing group. The children with serum ECP levels ≥7.9 μg/L at enrollment had higher risk of frequent wheezing than those with serum ECP<7.9 μg/L (p=0.008). The sensitivity of ECP ≥7.9 μg/L for frequent wheezing was 75.9% and the specificity was 68.7%. Similarly, serum total IgE (≥154 IU/ml) and total eosinophil count (≥390 /mm3) were found to be significantly higher in infants in the frequent wheezing group than the other groups (p=0.049, p=0.019). The multivariate analysis showed that the risk of frequent wheezing was 6.6 fold higher in children with a serum ECP level ≥7.9 μg /L and 5.3 fold higher in the presence of RSV / Adenovirus infection (p=0.026, p=0.038, respectively). Conclusion: In conclusion, our study suggested that the increase in serum ECP levels and the presence of RSV / Adenovirus infection significantly increased the risk of frequent wheezing in children with acute wheezing attacks.
AB  - Amaç: Astımlı olguların birçoğunda hışıltı semptomu yaşamın ilk yıllarında başlar. Çocukluk çağında astım gelişiminde rol oynayan faktörleri değerlendiren çalışmalar olmasına rağmen, erken çocukluk döneminde sık hışıltı gelişimini öngören değerler hâlâ net değildir. Çalışmamızın amacı, hışıltı atakları ile ailesel, prenatal ve postnatal risk faktörleri arasındaki ilişkiyi ve serum eozinofilik katyonik protein (ECP) ve eozinofil düzeylerinin sık hışıltı ataklarını öngörmedeki duyarlılığını araştırmaktır. Gereç ve Yöntem: Çalışmaya, yaşları 1-36 ay arasında değişen ve akut hışıltı atağı ile başvuran 57 çocuk ve 50 sağlam çocuk alındı. Başvurudan sonraki bir yıllık sürede ≥3 akut hışıltı atağı geçiren çocuklar sık hışıltı grubu, daha az sayıda atak geçirenler seyrek hışıltı grubu olarak tanımlandı. Hışıltı risk faktörlerini ayrıntılı sorgulayan anket formu dolduruldu. Tüm hastalardan serum total IgE, ECP, eozinofil sayısı, besin ve inhalan spesifik IgE düzeyleri ve RSV/ adenovirus serolojisi için kan örnekleri alındı, deri prik testi yapıldı. Öyküde besin allerjisi şüphesi olan olgularda besin provokasyon testleri uygulandı. (p=0.009) ve yumurta (p=0.018) başlanması, evde küf/nem varlığı (p=0.023), egzema (p<0.001) ve atopi (p=0.017) anlamlı düzeyde yüksek saptandı. Başvuru anında serum ECP düzeyi ≥7.9 µg/L olan çocuklarda sık hışıltı riski, serum ECP değeri <7.9 µg/L olanlara göre daha yüksek bulundu (p=0.008). Serum ECP düzeyi ≥7.9 μg/L olanlarda sık hışıltı gelişimi için duyarlılık %75.9, özgüllük ise %68.7'ydi. Benzer şekilde serum total IgE (≥154 IU/ml) ve total eozinofil sayısı yüksekliği (≥ 390/mm3) sık hışıltı grubundaki infantlarda diğer gruplara göre anlamlı düzeyde daha yüksek saptandı (p=0.049, p=0.019). Lojistik regresyon analizinde sık hışıltı atağı geçirme riskini, serum ECP düzeyinin ≥7.9 μg/L olmasının 6.6 kat, RSV/Adenovirüs infeksiyon varlığının ise 5.3 kat arttırdığı saptandı (sırasıyla p=0.026, p=0.038). Sonuç: Çalışmamız, akut hışıltı atağı ile başvuran çocuklarda serum ECP düzeyi yüksekliği ve RSV/Adenovirüs infeksiyonu varlığının sık hışıltı atağı geçirme riskini anlamlı derecede arttırdığını göstermiştir.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the role of miR-192 in differentiation of T follicular helper cells in childhood asthma. Blood samples were taken from eighteen children with acute asthma attacks and fifteen healthy children (HC). Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting were used to detect the expression levels of miR-192, C-X-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CXCR5), B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL-6) and inducible T-cell costimulator (ICOS). The flow cytometry was performed to detect the proportion of CD4 + CXCR5+ Tfh cells on CD4 + T lymphocytes. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was carried out to determine the plasma concentrations of total IgE and IL-21. The effect of miR-192 on the T follicular helper cells differentiation by targeting CXCR5 was determined by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Children with asthma had lower levels of miR-192 than HC. The proportion of CD4 + CXCR + Tfh cells was significantly higher in the acute asthma group than HC. Similarly, the plasma concentration of total IgE and IL-21 in the acute group markedly increased compared with the HC, and IgE concentration was positively correlated with the proportion of CD4 + CXCR5 + Tfh cells. Furthermore, the expression levels of CXCR5, Bcl-6 and ICOS were significantly higher in the acute group than in the HC. While the proportion of CD4 + CXCR5 + Tfh cells, IL-21, CXCR5, Bcl-6 and ICOS were obviously lower in the CD4 + T cells transfected with miR-192 plasmid than that in miR-192 + CXCR5 group and control group. In conclusion, miR-192 blocks the activation pathway of Tfh cells by targeting CXCR5, which is a reasonable cellular target for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Objective: To determine the proportion of the national childhood asthma burden associated with exposure to dampness and gas stoves in Australian homes.Design: Comparative risk assessment modelling study. Setting, participants: Australian children aged 14 years or less, 2011.Main Outcome Measures: The population attributable fractions (PAFs) and number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for childhood asthma associated with exposure to damp housing and gas stoves.Results: 26.1% of Australian homes have dampness problems and 38.2% have natural gas as the main energy source for cooktop stoves. The PAF for childhood asthma attributable to damp housing was 7.9% (95% CI, 3.2-12.6%), causing 1760 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs; 95% CI, 416-3104 DALYs), or 42 DALYs/100 000 children. The PAF associated with gas stoves was 12.3% (95% CI, 8.9-15.8%), corresponding to 2756 DALYs (95% CI, 1271-4242), or 67 DALYs/100 000 children. If all homes with gas stoves were fitted with high efficiency range hoods to vent gas combustion products outdoors, the PAF and burden estimates were reduced to 3.4% (95% CI, 2.2-4.6%) and 761 DALYs (95% CI, 322-1199).Conclusions: Exposure to damp housing and gas stoves is common in Australia, and is associated with a considerable proportion of the childhood asthma burden. Strategies for reducing exposure to indoor dampness and gas combustion products should be communicated to parents of children with or at risk of asthma.

AB  - Background: Sarcoidosis is a multisystem, chronic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology that predominantly affects the lungs. Pulmonary sarcoidosis classically presents with constitutional symptoms and computed tomographic scan findings of bilateral, symmetric micronodules in a peribronchovascular distribution with upper and middle lung zone predominance accompanied by bilateral, symmetric hilar lymphadenopathy. A solitary lung mass is a rare finding for pulmonary sarcoidosis, and with its associated constitutional symptoms, it strongly mimics a malignancy. We aimed to provide further insight into the broad differential diagnosis of a lung mass by describing our experiences in the care of a patient who presented with clinical and radiographic features of lung cancer who was ultimately found to have an atypical manifestation of stage II pulmonary sarcoidosis.Case Presentation: A 44-year-old African American woman with a history of childhood asthma and type 2 diabetes mellitus presented with shortness of breath. After being treated for a presumed asthma exacerbation with prednisone, she experienced worsening dyspnea, night sweats, and unintentional weight loss. Further evaluation revealed a large left lower lobe mass and hilar lymphadenopathy. A computed tomography-guided biopsy of the lung mass revealed a multifocal non-necrotizing granuloma with multinucleated giant cells. Although consistent with sarcoidosis, this finding could represent a sarcoid-like reaction secondary to an occult malignancy. A more extensive repeat biopsy via bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy revealed granulomatous inflammation without evidence of malignancy or infection. These procedures confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis, and she was started on treatment with high-dose prednisone. Her treatment course was complicated by hyperglycemia necessitating insulin therapy, but after 3 months of therapy, she reported improvement in her dyspnea, and repeat imaging revealed a significant decrease in the size of the lung mass and lymphadenopathy. Given her clinical and radiographic response, she was continued on a prednisone taper.Conclusions: Atypical manifestations of pulmonary sarcoidosis are diagnostically challenging because the clinical and radiographic features of the disease mimic those of a malignancy. We aimed to illustrate a unique etiology of a lung mass and the importance of maintaining a broad differential diagnosis. Nonetheless, with the possibility of a malignancy, a high index of suspicion is necessary for timely diagnosis and optimal management.

AB  - The Great London Smog of December 1952 lasted five days and killed up to 12,000 people. The smog developed primarily because of extensive burning of high-sulfur coal. The health effects were both immediate and long lasting, with a recent study revealing an increased likelihood of childhood asthma development in those exposed to the Great Smog while in utero or during their first year of life. Subsequent pollution legislation--including the U.S. Clean Air Act and its amendments--have demonstrably reduced air pollution and positively impacted health outcomes. With poor air quality events like the Great Smog continuing to occur today, nurses need to be aware of the impact such environmental disasters can have on human health.

AB  - Prenatal folic acid exposure has been linked to higher risk of childhood asthma in countries that do not fortify the food supply with folic acid. This study seeks to examine this association in the United States, where the food supply is generally fortified with folic acid. Participants were 1279 mother-child pairs from Project Viva, an ongoing prospective birth cohort, with folic acid intake in pregnancy assessed through validated food frequency questionnaires. The primary outcome was physician-diagnosed asthma at mid-childhood. In an unadjusted logistic regression model, higher folic acid intake was associated with lower odds of asthma in mid-childhood (odds ratio [OR] 0.48; 95% CI 0.31-0.76). However, in the adjusted analysis this association was attenuated (adjusted OR [aOR] 0.80; 95% CI 0.49-1.33). Our results suggest that in the United States, where there is generalized folic acid fortification of food, maternal folic acid intake during pregnancy is not associated with asthma development in offspring.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: The purpose of this review is to summarize the recent evidence on the distinct atopic phenotypes and their relationship with childhood asthma. We start by considering definitions and phenotypic classification of atopy and then review evidence on its association with asthma in children.Recent Findings: It is now well recognized that both asthma and atopy are complex entities encompassing various different sub-groups that also differ in the way they interconnect. The lack of gold standards for diagnostic markers of atopy and asthma further adds to the existing complexity over diagnostic accuracy and definitions. Although recent statistical phenotyping studies contributed significantly to our understanding of these heterogeneous disorders, translating these findings into meaningful information and effective therapies requires further work on understanding underpinning biological mechanisms.Summary: The disaggregation of allergic sensitization may help predict how the allergic disease is likely to progress. One of the important questions is how best to incorporate tests for the assessment of allergic sensitization into diagnostic algorithms for asthma, both in terms of confirming asthma diagnosis, and the assessment of future risk.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: Exposure to air pollutants is linked with poor asthma control in children and represents a potentially modifiable risk factor for impaired lung function, rescue medication use, and increased asthma-related healthcare utilization. Identification of the most relevant pollutants to asthma as well as susceptibility factors and strategies to reduce exposure are needed to improve child health.Recent Findings: The current available literature supports the association between pollutants and negative asthma outcomes. Ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and presence of certain gene polymorphisms may impact susceptibility to the negative health effects of air pollution. Improved air quality standards were associated with better asthma outcomes.Summary: The link between air pollution and pediatric asthma morbidity is supported by the recent relevant literature. Continued efforts are needed to identify the most vulnerable populations and develop strategies to reduce exposures and improve air quality.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: Epigenetic marks are emerging as mediators of genetics and the environment on complex disease phenotypes, including childhood asthma and allergy.Recent Findings: Epigenome-wide association studies over the past year have added to the growing body of evidence supporting significant associations of epigenetic regulation of gene expression and asthma and allergy. Studies in children have identified signatures of eosinophils in peripheral blood, Th2 cell transcription factors and cytokines in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and epithelial dysfunction in the respiratory epithelium. Importantly, studies at birth have begun to decipher the contribution of epigenetic marks to asthma inception. Few studies have also begun to address the contribution of genetics and the environment to these associations.Summary: Next generation of epigenome-wide association studies that will deal with confounders, study the influence of the genetics and environment, and incorporate multiple datasets to provide better interpretation of the findings are on the horizon. Identification of key epigenetic marks that are shaped by genetics and the environment, and impact transcription of specific genes will help us have a better understanding of etiology, heterogeneity and severity of asthma, and will also empower us to develop biologically driven therapeutics and biomarkers for secondary prevention of this disease.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: The objective of this review is to provide an update on our evolving understanding of the effects of stress in pregnancy and during early development on the onset of asthma-related phenotypes across childhood, adolescence, and into early adulthood.Recent Findings: Accumulating evidence over the past 2 decades has established that prenatal and early-life psychological stress and stress correlates (e.g., maternal anxiety or depression) increase the risk for childhood respiratory disorders. Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses including numerous prospective epidemiological and case-control studies substantiate a significant effect of prenatal stress and stress in early childhood on the development of wheeze, asthma, and other atopic-related disorders (eczema and allergic rhinitis), with many studies showing an exposure-response relationship. Offspring of both sexes are susceptible to perinatal stress, but effects differ. The impact of stress on child wheeze/asthma can also be modified by exposure timing. Moreover, coexposure to prenatal stress can enhance the effect of chemical stressors, such as prenatal traffic-related air pollution, on childhood respiratory disease risk. Understanding complex interactions among exposure dose, timing, child sex, and concurrent environmental exposures promises to more fully characterize stress effects and identify susceptible subgroups. Although the link between perinatal stress and childhood asthma-related phenotypes is now well established, pathways by which stress predisposes children to chronic respiratory disorders are not as well delineated. Mechanisms central to the pathophysiology of wheeze/asthma and lung growth and development overlap and involve a cascade of events that include disrupted immune, neuroendocrine, and autonomic function as well as oxidative stress. Altered homeostatic functioning of these integrated systems during development can enhance vulnerability to asthma and altered lung development.Summary: Mechanistic studies that more comprehensively assess biomarkers reflecting alterations across interrelated stress response systems and associated regulatory processes, in both pregnant women and young children, could be highly informative. Leveraging high-throughput systems-wide technologies to include epigenomics (e.g., DNA methylation, microRNAs), transcriptomics, and microbiomics as well as integrated multiomics are needed to advance this field of science. Understanding stress-induced physiological changes occurring during vulnerable life periods that contribute to chronic respiratory disease risk could lead to the development of preventive strategies and novel therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Objectives: To study whether the duration of breastfeeding and time for introduction of complementary foods was associated with the risk of childhood asthma.Study Design: We used data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Study, a nationwide prospective cohort study that recruited pregnant women from across Norway between 1999 and 2008. Children with complete data of breastfeeding up to 18 months and current age >7 years were eligible (n = 41 020). Asthma as the primary outcome was defined based on ≥2 dispensed asthma medications at age 7 years registered in the Norwegian Prescription Database. We used log-binomial regression models to obtain crude relative risks (RRs) in the main analysis, and adjusted for selected confounders in multivariable analyses.Results: For duration of any breastfeeding, 5.9% of infants breastfed <6 months (adjusted RR [aRR] 1.05, 0.93-1.19) and 4.6% breastfed 6-11 months (aRR 0.96, 0.87-1.07) had dispensed asthma medications at age 7 years compared with 4.6% of infants breastfed ≥12 months (Ptrend .62). Infants still breastfed at 6 months, but introduced to complementary foods <4 months and 4-6 months, had an aRR of 1.15 (0.98-1.36) and 1.09 (0.94-1.27) respectively, compared with infants fully breastfed for 6 months (Ptrend .09). Ages at introduction of solids or formula separately were not significant predictors (Ptrend .16 and .08, respectively).Conclusions: We found no association between duration of breastfeeding or age of introduction to complementary foods and asthma at age 7 years.

AB  - Background: Studies of potential adverse effects of traffic related air pollution (TRAP) on allergic disease have had mixed findings. Nutritional studies to examine whether fish oil supplementation may protect against development of allergic disease through their anti-inflammatory actions have also had mixed findings. Extremely few studies to date have considered whether air pollution and dietary factors such as fish oil intake may interact, which was the rationale for this study.Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of the Childhood Asthma Prevention Study (CAPS) birth cohort, where children were randomised to fish oil supplementation or placebo from early life to age 5 years. We examined interactions between supplementation and TRAP (using weighted road density at place of residence as our measure of traffic related air pollution exposure) with allergic disease and lung function outcomes at age 5 and 8 years.Results: Outcome information was available on approximately 400 children (~ 70% of the original birth cohort). Statistically significant interactions between fish oil supplementation and TRAP were seen for house dust mite (HDM), inhalant and all-allergen skin prick tests (SPTs) and for HDM-specific interleukin-5 response at age 5. Adjusting for relevant confounders, relative risks (RRs) for positive HDM SPT were RR 1.74 (95% CI 1.22-2.48) per 100 m local road or 33.3 m of motorway within 50 m of the home for those randomised to the control group and 1.03 (0.76-1.41) for those randomised to receive the fish oil supplement. The risk differential was highest in an analysis restricted to those who did not change address between ages 5 and 8 years. In this sub-group, supplementation also protected against the effect of traffic exposure on pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio.Conclusions: Results suggest that fish oil supplementation may protect against pro-allergic sensitisation effects of TRAP exposure. Strengths of this analysis are that supplementation was randomised and independent of TRAP exposure, however, findings need to be confirmed in a larger experimental study with the interaction investigated as a primary hypothesis, potentially also exploring epigenetic mechanisms. More generally, studies of adverse health effects of air pollution may benefit from considering potential effect modification by diet and other factors.Trial Registration: Australia New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry. www.anzctr.org.au Registration: ACTRN12605000042640 , Date: 26th July 2005.

AB  - Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is the only disease-modifying treatment approved for allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma and represents a suitable therapeutic option, especially in childhood, to modify the progression of respiratory allergic diseases. Starting from the previous “generic class effect” evaluation, as testified by the numerous meta analyses, AIT is now considered a product-specific pathogenic-oriented treatment. Background: AIT was empirically proposed more than one century ago in the subcutaneous form (SCIT), but the IgE-mediated mechanism of allergy was elucidated only after 50 years of clinical use of the treatment. The sublingual administration (SLIT) was developed during the 1980 ties, to achieve an improvement in safety and convenience. While SCIT is approved in the United States for the treatment of asthmatic patients with more than 12 years, so far few trials evaluated the clinical efficacy and safety of SLIT in children with allergic asthma, although the indications and some aspects remain unclear. Certainly, due to compliance problems, the age below 3 years may be reasonably considered a practical contraindication. Conclusions: Given that some specific AIT products are effective and approved as drugs (AIFA, EMA, FDA), the use in children is still debated. Some aspects still need robust confirm: (a) the safety of AIT in asthma; (b) the optimal regimen of administration; (c) the role of AIT as preventative treatment for asthma development.

AB  - Rationale: Experimental evidence suggests that CDHR3 (cadherin-related family member 3) is a receptor for rhinovirus (RV)-C, and a missense variant in this gene (rs6967330) is associated with childhood asthma with severe exacerbations.Objectives: To determine whether rs6967330 influences RV-C infections and illnesses in early childhood.Methods: We studied associations between rs6967330 and respiratory infections and illnesses in the COPSAC2010 (Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010) and COAST (Childhood Origins of Asthma Birth Cohort Study) birth cohorts, where respiratory infections were monitored prospectively for the first 3 years of life. Nasal samples were collected during acute infections in both cohorts and during asymptomatic periods in COAST and analyzed for RV-A, RV-B, and RV-C, and other common respiratory viruses.Measurements and Main Results: The CDHR3 asthma risk allele (rs6967330-A) was associated with increased risk of respiratory tract illnesses (incidence risk ratio [IRR] = 1.14 [95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.23]; P = 0.003). In particular, this variant was associated with risk of respiratory episodes with detection of RV-C in COPSAC2010 (IRR = 1.89 [1.14-3.05]; P = 0.01) and in COAST (IRR = 1.37 [1.02-1.82]; P = 0.03) children, and in a combined meta-analysis (IRR = 1.51 [1.13-2.02]; P = 0.006). In contrast, the variant was not associated with illnesses related to other viruses (IRR = 1.07 [0.92-1.25]; P = 0.37). Consistent with these observations, the CDHR3 variant was associated with increased detection of RV-C, but not of other viruses during scheduled visits at specific ages.Conclusions: The CDHR3 asthma risk allele is associated specifically with RV-C illnesses in two birth cohorts. This clinical evidence supports earlier molecular evidence indicating that CDHR3 functions as an RV-C receptor, and raises the possibility of preventing RV-C infections by targeting CDHR3.

AB  - Background: Perinatal factors are suspected to have a significant impact on the development of asthma; however, sufficiently powered studies have not been performed to investigate this issue.Objective: To evaluate whether perinatal factors and other risk factors have an independent or combined effect on the development of asthma.Methods: This study involved 3,770 children (mean age 9.1 years, range 5.68-12.16 years; 51.9% boys) who were enrolled in the Elementary School Student Cohort (2009-2014) in Ulsan University Hospital (Ulsan, Korea). Subjects were divided into an asthma group (n = 514) and a non-asthma group (n = 3,256).Results: Multivariate analyses showed that early life (within first week) oxygen therapy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.864, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.156-3.004) and breastfeeding (aOR 0.763, 95% CI 0.606-0.960) were 2 significant perinatal factors influencing the development of asthma. Environmental tobacco smoke (aOR 1.634, 95% CI 1.298-2.058) and parental allergic disease (aOR 1.882, 95% CI 1.521-2.328) also were identified as risk factors. Using subgroup analyses, combined effects on asthma development were observed between perinatal factors (early life oxygen therapy and breastfeeding) and other risk factors (vicinity to major roadway [traffic-related air pollution], environmental tobacco smoke, parental allergic disease, and atopy).Conclusion: Early life oxygen therapy and breastfeeding were identified as 2 important perinatal factors influencing the development of asthma. Furthermore, these factors showed combined effects with other risk factors (environmental tobacco smoke, traffic-related air pollution, parental allergic disease, and atopy) on the development of asthma.

AB  - Emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalization are common, costly and the greatest disease burden to children with asthma. Admission rates for asthma vary substantially by site and ED provider. Disease heterogeneity and ED provider uncertainty surrounding likelihood of successful discharge contribute to potentially avoidable hospitalizations. New approaches to improve ED disposition decision-making could improve patient care and reduce waste associated with unnecessary hospitalizations. Several asthma severity scores and asthma prediction models have been evaluated for their ability to predict ED disposition for childhood asthma. Our objective is to review prior studies that modeled predictors of disposition outcomes for children treated in ED settings for acute asthma exacerbations.

AB  - Children with severe asthma continue to experience symptoms despite long-term treatment with high doses of corticosteroids. Moreover, the heterogeneous nature of asthma and the presence of several phenotypes have limited our ability to develop an optimized management strategy for these patients. Adequate management of severe asthma in children necessitates a detailed understanding of what makes asthma difficult to control, knowledge of the causal factors, review of diagnosis for accurate identification of pediatric patients with severe asthma and a precise definition of the phenotypes to be able to better target the therapy. Advancement in all these aspects is likely to improve childhood asthma treatment in the future. Although our understanding of severe pediatric asthma has grown in recent years, there remains a lack of consensus and clarity around critical aspects of this condition. This review attempts to present a harmonized view on the definition of severe asthma in the pediatric age group, identification of phenotypes and diagnosis, the inflammatory cascade, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment strategies, considerations for follow-up and referral to specialists, and disease prevention strategies.

AB  - BackgroundAlterations of B2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) can modulate the severity of asthma and the response to treatment. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate β2AR gene polymorphism at codons 16 and 27 and their effect on asthma severity and response to treatment in asthmatic children.MethodsCase-control study was conducted on 156 children; 104 of them had bronchial asthma and 52 were healthy children (control group). Subjects of the study underwent history taking, clinical examination, pulmonary function tests, serum IgE level assessment, and identification of β2AR-16 A46G and β2AR-27 C79G polymorphism using PCR-Restriction Fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) test.ResultsThere was a higher frequency of Arg-Gly genotypes (odds ratio (OR)=6.57; confidence interval (CI): 2.42-18.81, P<0.001) and lower frequency of Arg-Arg (OR=4.7; CI: 2.05-10.95, P<0.001) among asthmatic children compared with that among controls at codon 16. The presence or absence of Gly16 or Glu27 either homozygous or heterozygous for both correlated with the grade of asthma severity. The presence of heterozygous Arg-Gly and Gln-Glu gives a better response to drug therapy than the presence of Gly-Gly and Glu-Glu genotypes at codons 16 and 27.ConclusionPolymorphism of β2AR at codons 16 and 27 correlates with asthma severity and response to treatment in asthmatic children.

AB  - Rationale: Cross-sectional studies have linked intake of high-fructose corn syrup-sweetened beverages with asthma in schoolchildren.Objectives: To examine associations of maternal prenatal and early childhood intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and fructose with current asthma in midchildhood (median age, 7.7 yr).Methods: We assessed maternal pregnancy (first- and second-trimester average) and child (median age, 3.3 yr) intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and total fructose using food frequency questionnaires in 1,068 mother-child pairs from Project Viva, a prospective prebirth cohort. In a multivariable analysis, we examined associations of quartiles of maternal and child sugar-sweetened beverage, juice, and total fructose intake with child current asthma in midchildhood, assessed by questionnaire as ever having doctor-diagnosed asthma plus taking asthma medications or reporting wheezing in the past 12 months.Results: Higher maternal pregnancy sugar-sweetened beverage consumption (mean, 0.6 servings/d; range, 0-5) was associated with younger maternal age, nonwhite race/ethnicity, lower education and income, and higher prepregnancy body mass index. Adjusting for prepregnancy body mass index and other covariates, comparing quartile 4 with quartile 1, higher maternal pregnancy intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (odds ratio, 1.70; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-2.67) and total fructose (odds ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.98-2.53) were associated with greater odds of midchildhood current asthma (prevalence, 19%). Higher early childhood fructose intake (quartile 4 vs. quartile 1) was also associated with midchildhood current asthma in models adjusted for maternal sugar-sweetened beverages (odds ratio, 1.79; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-2.97) and after additional adjustment for midchildhood body mass index z-score (odds ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-2.95).Conclusions: Higher sugar-sweetened beverage and fructose intake during pregnancy and in early childhood was associated with childhood asthma development independent of adiposity.

AB  - Background: Previous investigations in adult smokers from the COPDGene Study have shown that early-life respiratory disease is associated with reduced lung function, COPD, and airway thickening. Using 5-year follow-up data, we assessed disease progression in subjects who had experienced early-life respiratory disease. We hypothesized that there are alternative pathways to reaching reduced FEV1 and that subjects who had childhood pneumonia, childhood asthma, or asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) would have less lung function decline than subjects without these conditions.Methods: Subjects returning for 5-year follow-up were assessed. Childhood pneumonia was defined by self-reported pneumonia at < 16 years. Childhood asthma was defined as self-reported asthma diagnosed by a health professional at < 16 years. ACO was defined as subjects with COPD who self-reported asthma diagnosed by a health-professional at ≤ 40 years. Smokers with and those without these early-life respiratory diseases were compared on measures of disease progression.Results: Follow-up data from 4,915 subjects were examined, including 407 subjects who had childhood pneumonia, 323 subjects who had childhood asthma, and 242 subjects with ACO. History of childhood asthma or ACO was associated with an increased exacerbation frequency (childhood asthma, P < .001; ACO, P = .006) and odds of severe exacerbations (childhood asthma, OR, 1.41; ACO, OR, 1.42). History of childhood pneumonia was associated with increased exacerbations in subjects with COPD (absolute difference [β], 0.17; P = .04). None of these early-life respiratory diseases were associated with an increased rate of lung function decline or progression on CT scans.Conclusions: Subjects who had early-life asthma are at increased risk of developing COPD and of having more active disease with more frequent and severe respiratory exacerbations without an increased rate of lung function decline over a 5-year period.Trial Registry: ClinicalTrials.gov; No. NCT00608764; https://clinicaltrials.gov.

AB  - Background: Previous research has found that maternal stress during pregnancy increases the risk of offspring asthma. However, whether this association is consistent with a causal interpretation has never been tested. The objective is to determine whether there is a critical exposure period for maternal depression or anxiety on offspring asthma or whether cumulative exposure is most important, and to investigate evidence of confounding.Methods: The study population included all children born in Sweden from July 2006 to December 2009 (n = 360 526). Information about childhood asthma, maternal depression or anxiety (diagnosis or medication) and covariates was obtained from the Swedish national health registers. The associations between exposure periods (pre-conception, pregnancy, postnatal or current) and childhood asthma were estimated using structured life course approach hypothesis testing. Paternal and cousin analyses were used to test for evidence of confounding from shared genes and environment.Results: For childhood asthma, cumulative exposure best described the effect of exposure to maternal depression or anxiety up to a maximum of any two exposure periods [adjusted odds ratio 1.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.38, 1.52]. The hypotheses of a critical period were not supported. The paternal and cousin analyses indicated minimal influence from familial confounding.Conclusions: These findings support an association between cumulative exposure to maternal depression or anxiety and asthma development in offspring. This association is unique for maternal depression or anxiety and not due to familial confounding. The clinical implication is that effective psychological management of women with chronic distress may reduce offspring asthma risk.

AB  - CONTEXT: The association between acid-suppressive drug exposure during pregnancy and childhood asthma has not been well established. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on this association to provide further justification for the current studies. DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EBSCO Information Services, Web of Science, and Google Scholar from inception until June 2017. STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies in which researchers assessed acid-suppressive drug use during pregnancy and the risk of childhood asthma were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Of 556 screened articles, 8 population-based studies were included in the final analyses. RESULTS: When all the studies were pooled, acid-suppressive drug use in pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of asthma in childhood (relative risk [RR] = 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35-1.56; I² = 0%; P < .00001). The overall risk of asthma in childhood increased among proton pump inhibitor users (RR = 1.34; 95% CI 1.18-1.52; I² = 46%; P < .00001) and histamine-2 receptor antagonist users (RR = 1.57; 95% CI 1.46-1.69; I² = 0%; P < .00001). LIMITATIONS: None of the researchers in the studies in this meta-analysis adjusted for the full panel of known confounders in these associations. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence suggests that prenatal, maternal, acid-suppressive drug use is associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma. This information may help clinicians and parents to use caution when deciding whether to take acid-suppressing drugs during pregnancy because of the risk of asthma in offspring.

AB  - Rationale: Pediatric asthma has variable underlying inflammation and symptom control. Approaches to addressing this heterogeneity, such as clustering methods to find phenotypes and predict outcomes, have been investigated. However, clustering based on the relationship between treatment and clinical outcome has not been performed, and machine learning approaches for long-term outcome prediction in pediatric asthma have not been studied in depth.Objectives: Our objectives were to use our novel machine learning algorithm, predictor pursuit (PP), to discover pediatric asthma phenotypes on the basis of asthma control in response to controller medications, to predict longitudinal asthma control among children with asthma, and to identify features associated with asthma control within each discovered pediatric phenotype.Methods: We applied PP to the Childhood Asthma Management Program study data (n = 1,019) to discover phenotypes on the basis of asthma control between assigned controller therapy groups (budesonide vs. nedocromil). We confirmed PP's ability to discover phenotypes using the Asthma Clinical Research Network/Childhood Asthma Research and Education network data. We next predicted children's asthma control over time and compared PP's performance with that of traditional prediction methods. Last, we identified clinical features most correlated with asthma control in the discovered phenotypes.Results: Four phenotypes were discovered in both datasets: allergic not obese (A+/O-), obese not allergic (A-/O+), allergic and obese (A+/O+), and not allergic not obese (A-/O-). Of the children with well-controlled asthma in the Childhood Asthma Management Program dataset, we found more nonobese children treated with budesonide than with nedocromil (P = 0.015) and more obese children treated with nedocromil than with budesonide (P = 0.008). Within the obese group, more A+/O+ children's asthma was well controlled with nedocromil than with budesonide (P = 0.022) or with placebo (P = 0.011). The PP algorithm performed significantly better (P < 0.001) than traditional machine learning algorithms for both short- and long-term asthma control prediction. Asthma control and bronchodilator response were the features most predictive of short-term asthma control, regardless of type of controller medication or phenotype. Bronchodilator response and serum eosinophils were the most predictive features of asthma control, regardless of type of controller medication or phenotype.Conclusions: Advanced statistical machine learning approaches can be powerful tools for discovery of phenotypes based on treatment response and can aid in asthma control prediction in complex medical conditions such as asthma.

AB  - Background: Early-life exposure to traffic-related air pollution exacerbates childhood asthma, but it is unclear what role it plays in asthma development.Methods: The association between exposure to primary mobile source pollutants during pregnancy and during infancy and asthma incidence by ages 2 through 6 was examined in the Kaiser Air Pollution and Pediatric Asthma Study, a racially diverse birth cohort of 24,608 children born between 2000 and 2010 and insured by Kaiser Permanente Georgia. We estimated concentrations of mobile source fine particulate matter (PM2.5, µg/m), nitrogen oxides (NOX, ppb), and carbon monoxide (CO, ppm) at the maternal and child residence using a Research LINE source dispersion model for near-surface releases. Asthma was defined using diagnoses and medication dispensings from medical records. We used binomial generalized linear regression to model the impact of exposure continuously and by quintiles on asthma risk.Results: Controlling for covariates and modeling log-transformed exposure, a 2.7-fold increase in first year of life PM2.5 was associated with an absolute 4.1% (95% confidence interval, 1.6%, 6.6%) increase in risk of asthma by age 5. Quintile analysis showed an increase in risk from the first to second quintile, but similar risk across quintiles 2-5. Risk differences increased with follow-up age. Results were similar for NOX and CO and for exposure during pregnancy and the first year of life owing to high correlation.Conclusions: Results provide limited evidence for an association of early-life mobile source air pollution with childhood asthma incidence with a steeper concentration-response relationship observed at lower levels of exposure.

AB  - Background: Inhaled corticosteroids are recommended as the first-line controller medication for childhood asthma owing to their multiple clinical benefits. However, heterogeneity in the response towards these drugs remains a significant clinical problem.Methods: Children aged 5 to 18 years with mild to moderate persistent asthma were recruited into the Taiwanese Consortium of Childhood Asthma Study. Their responses to inhaled corticosteroids were assessed based on their improvements in the asthma control test and peak expiratory flow. The predictors of responsiveness were demographic and clinical features that were available in primary care settings. We have developed a prediction model using logistic regression and have simplified it to formulate a practical tool. We assessed its predictive performance using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.Results: Of the 73 asthmatic children with baseline and follow-up outcome measurements for inhaled corticosteroids treatment, 24 (33%) were defined as non-responders. The tool we have developed consisted of three predictors yielding a total score between 0 and 5, which are comprised of the following parameters: the age at physician-diagnosis of asthma, sex, and exhaled nitric oxide. Sensitivity and specificity of the tool for prediction of inhaled corticosteroids non-responsiveness, for a score of 3, were 0.75 and 0.69, respectively. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the prediction tool was 0.763.Conclusions: Our prediction tool represents a simple and low-cost method for predicting the response of inhaled corticosteroids treatment in asthmatic children.

AB  - Introduction: Obesity is common among women of childbearing age; intrauterine exposure to maternal obesity or gestational weight gain may influence the development of asthma in early childhood. We examined the relationships of maternal obesity and gestational weight gain with asthma in offspring.Methods: We used data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort, which has a nationally representative sample of children followed from birth in 2001 through age 4 (n = 6,450). Asthma was based on parental report of a medical professional's diagnosis. We used generalized estimating equation binomial models to compute adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of childhood asthma with maternal obesity and 4 measures of gestational weight gain.Results: Compared with children of normal-weight mothers, children of obese mothers had increased risk of asthma (adjusted OR, 1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-2.12) by age 4, and children born to overweight mothers had similar risk (adjusted OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.99-1.59). Extreme-low weight gain (<5 kg) and extreme-high weight gain (≥25 kg) were associated with increased risk of asthma; however, the following measures were not significant predictors of asthma: meeting gestational weight gain recommendations of the Institute of Medicine, total gestational weight gain, and weekly rate of weight gain in the second and third trimesters.Conclusion: Extreme-low or extreme-high gestational weight gain and maternal obesity are risk factors for early childhood asthma, further evidence of the long-term impact of intrauterine exposure on children and the need to target preconception care to improve child health indicators.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether different modes of infant feeding are associated with childhood asthma, including differentiating between direct breastfeeding and expressed breast milk.Study Design: We studied 3296 children in the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development birth cohort. The primary exposure was infant feeding mode at 3 months, reported by mothers and categorized as direct breastfeeding only, breastfeeding with some expressed breast milk, breast milk and formula, or formula only. The primary outcome was asthma at 3 years of age, diagnosed by trained healthcare professionals.Results: At 3 months of age, the distribution of feeding modes was 27% direct breastfeeding, 32% breastfeeding with some expressed breast milk, 26% breast milk and formula, and 15% formula only. At 3 years of age, 12% of children were diagnosed with possible or probable asthma. Compared with direct breastfeeding, any other mode of infant feeding was associated with an increased risk of asthma. These associations persisted after adjusting for maternal asthma, ethnicity, method of birth, infant sex, gestational age, and daycare attendance (some expressed breast milk: aOR, 1.64, 95% CI, 1.12-2.39; breast milk and formula, aOR, 1.73, 95% CI, 1.17-2.57; formula only: aOR, 2.14, 95% CI, 1.37-3.35). Results were similar after further adjustment for total breastfeeding duration and respiratory infections.Conclusions: Modes of infant feeding are associated with asthma development. Direct breastfeeding is most protective compared with formula feeding; indirect breast milk confers intermediate protection. Policies that facilitate and promote direct breastfeeding could have impact on the primary prevention of asthma.

AB  - Background: Pediatric bone health is an important part of the safety assessment of inhaled corticosteroids and certain other drugs. Current regulatory guidance for assessment of bone health for intranasal and inhaled corticosteroid drugs is a single 1-year study of linear growth. Objective: The objective of this study was to assess whether a significant change in bone mineral density (BMD) could be observed during a 12-month period in pediatric patients being treated for asthma with an inhaled corticosteroid using a previously conducted study. Methods: The publicly available information from the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) study was used to assess whether a statistically significant difference in BMD could be detected over a 1-year period. Patients who were at Tanner stage ≥2 were excluded from analysis as is stated in the present FDA Guidance on growth studies with inhaled corticosteroids, and children with any use of oral corticosteroids were also excluded. A comparison in BMD change over time (bone mineral accretion [BMA]) between baseline and 12 months of follow-up was made for the placebo and inhaled budesonide groups using multiple regression analysis to account for age, race, and gender as covariates. Results: From the original 1041 patients in the CAMP study, 74 patients met the criteria for evaluation, with 42 patients receiving budesonide and 32 placebo patients. Children randomized to budesonide had a lower mean BMA than those receiving placebo (0.021 ± 0.023 [SD] g/cm2/y vs 0.036 ± 0.025 [SD] g/cm2/y). Conclusion: In a select pediatric patient population, a significant change in BMA can be observed over 12 months on an inhaled corticosteroid. Based on this post hoc analysis, measurement of BMA as an assessment of pediatric bone health may be considered for certain drugs, especially when there is a potential signal of bone toxicity from animal or human data. The clinical relevance of this finding is presently unknown, and more data on the relationship between changes in BMA and clinical pediatric bone health outcomes are needed.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of the present systematic review was to synthesize evidence from the literature to assess efficacy of the Mediterranean dietary pattern in childhood asthma. Design/Setting A systematic search of six databases, three clinical trial registries and hand-search of peer-reviewed articles was conducted up to 29 October 2016. Inclusion criteria included exposure to a Mediterranean dietary pattern, measurement of asthma symptoms and study population of children aged <18 years. Quality assessment was conducted. Due to significant heterogeneity, meta-analysis was not feasible.Results: Of the 436 articles identified, after removal of duplicates and based on inclusion criteria, fifteen observational studies conducted in Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean countries were relevant. No randomized controlled trials were retrieved. Twelve studies reported an inverse association between adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern and asthma in children, two studies showed no association and one study showed an increase in asthma symptoms. In fourteen out of fifteen studies, quality assessment checks revealed good reliability and validity among study methodologies.Conclusions: The current systematic review revealed a consistent inverse relationship (protective) between a Mediterranean dietary pattern and asthma in children. Future well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to provide solid evidence. Nevertheless, the existing level of evidence adds to the public health message relating to the beneficial effects of a Mediterranean-type diet in children suffering with asthma.

AB  - Background: Augmentation index (AIx) is a noninvasive measure of pulse wave reflection. AIx is associated with cardiovascular disease. Adult women have a higher AIx than men, but the factors determining this sex-related difference remain to be determined.Methods: To examine factors associated with AIx in adolescents, participants in the Childhood Asthma Prevention Study, followed from birth, were assessed at age 14 years, with AIx standardized to a heart rate of 75/min (AIx_75) and pulse wave velocity. Associations of AIx_75 and pulse wave velocity with height, change in height, and measures of puberty were assessed.Results: AIx_75 was higher in women compared to men [-24.5 (12.1) versus -32.3 (12.4)%; P < 0.001]. Lower AIx_75 was significantly related to greater change in height between 8 and 14 years, but not to achieved height. The sex difference in AIx was not independently related to puberty variables. Differences between sexes included early life weight gain, lipids, height, BMI-Z-score, change in height from 8 to 14 years, and age at peak height velocity. Change in AIx_75 from 8 to 14 years was highly associated with change in height (m) from 8 to 14 years (B = -88.8, 95% confidence interval -137.3 to -40.3, P =  < 0.001). The difference between sexes established at 8 years was not amplified from 8 to 14 years.Conclusion: AIx is higher in girls than boys at 14 years and is closely associated with change in height between 8 and 14 years. Measures of puberty do not appear to independently influence the sex difference in AIx in adolescents.

AB  - Background: An association between childhood asthma and IgE sensitization has been established, but our understanding of the genetic and environmental contribution to it is incomplete. Our aim was to estimate the associations and dose-response relationship between asthma and sensitization to airborne allergens in Swedish 9- to 14-year-old twins. Additionally, we aimed to explore the importance of familial confounding from shared genes and environment using co-twin controls.Methods: In the STOPPA cohort, 752 same-sex twin children were screened with Phadiatop® (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden); if positive further analysis of IgE antibodies to airborne allergens of pets (cat, horse, dog), pollens (birch, timothy, mugwort), mites, and mold were performed. The associations between asthma and airborne allergens were assessed with generalized estimating equations. The co-twin control analysis was performed by conditional logistic regression.Results: Children with positive Phadiatop® had more than doubled odds of asthma (OR 2.53, 95% CI [1.74, 3.70]). Sensitization to pet allergens was associated with increased odds of asthma; for example, cat OR 4.15 (95% CI [2.67, 6.45]), with similar estimates for pollens; for example, birch OR 3.22 (95% CI [2.12, 4.91]). Associations persisted with sensitization as a categorical variable and for trend, indicating a dose-response relationship. Results remained in the co-twin analyses; for example, cat OR 4.75 (95% CI [1.62, 14.0]) and birch OR 5.00 (95% CI [1.45, 17.3]).Conclusion: The association between childhood asthma and sensitization to airborne allergens remains in co-twin analyses, indicating they are not due to confounding from shared environmental or genetic factors.

AB  - Background: There is evidence from existing literature that ambient air pollutant exposure in early childhood likely plays an important role in asthma exacerbation and other respiratory symptoms, with greater effect among asthmatic children. However, there is inconclusive evidence on the role of ambient air pollutant exposures in relation to increasing asthma prevalence as well as asthma induction in children. At the population level, little is known about the potential synergistic effects between pollen allergens and air pollutants since this type of association poses challenges in uncontrolled real life settings. In particular, data from sub-Sahara Africa is scarce and virtually absent among populations residing in informal residential settlements.Methods/design: A prospective cohort study of 600 school children residing in four informal settlement areas with varying potential ambient air pollutant exposure levels in the Western Cape in South Africa is carried-out. The study has two follow-up periods of at least six-months apart including an embedded panel study in summer and winter. The exposure assessment component models temporal and spatial variability of air quality in the four study areas over the study duration using land-use regression modelling (LUR). Additionally, daily pollen levels (mould spores, tree, grass and weed pollen) in the study areas are recorded. In the panel study asthma symptoms and serial peak flow measurements is recorded three times daily to determine short-term serial airway changes in relation to varying ambient air quality and pollen over 10-days during winter and summer. The health outcome component of the cohort study include; the presence of asthma using a standardised ISAAC questionnaire, spirometry, fractional exhaled nitric-oxide (FeNO) and the presence of atopy (Phadiatop).Discussion: This research applies state of the art exposure assessment approaches to characterize the effects of ambient air pollutants on childhood respiratory health, with a specific focus on asthma and markers of airway inflammation (FeNO) in South African informal settlement areas by considering also pollen counts and meteorological factors. The study will generate crucial data on air pollution and asthma in low income settings in sub-Sahara Africa that is lacking in the international literature.

AB  - Background: Recent research has quantified the national health care resource use (HCRU) and health care expenditure (HCE) burden associated with adult asthma; however, estimates specific to school-aged children are more than 2 decades old.Objective: To estimate the national HCRU and HCEs attributable to asthma among school-aged children in the United States.Methods: This was a cross-sectional retrospective analysis of school-aged children (aged 6-17 years) in the nationally representative 2007-2013 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. All-cause HCRU and HCEs of school-aged children with asthma were compared with school-aged children without asthma, controlling for sociodemographics and comorbidities. HCRU encounters included emergency department (ED) and outpatient visits, hospitalizations, and prescriptions. Expenditures included total, medical, ED, inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy. Negative binomial regression analyses were used for HCRU and Heckman selection with logarithmic transformation, and smearing retransformation was used for HCEs.Results: There were 44,320 school-aged children of whom 5,890 had asthma. Children with asthma incurred a higher rate of all-cause annual ED visits (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.5; P < .001), hospitalizations (IRR, 1.4; P < .05), outpatient visits (IRR, 1.4; P < .001), and prescription drugs (IRR, 3.3; P < .001) compared with school-aged children without asthma. They incurred US$847 (2015 dollars) more annually in all-cause expenditures (P < .001). Private insurance and Medicaid paid the largest share of expenditures. Pharmacy and outpatient costs represented the largest proportion of total expenditures. On the basis of the nationally representative Medical Expenditure Panel Survey sample weights from 2013, the total annual HCEs attributable to asthma for school-aged children in the United States was US$5.92 billion (2015 dollars).Conclusion: Childhood asthma continues to represent a prevalent and significant clinical and economic burden in the United States. More aggressive treatment and asthma management programs are needed to address this national financial and resource burden.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Household air pollution due to biomass combustion for residential heating adversely affects vulnerable populations. Randomized controlled trials to improve indoor air quality in homes of children with asthma are limited, and no such studies have been conducted in homes using wood for heating. OBJECTIVES: Our aims were to test the hypothesis that household-level interventions, specifically improved-technology wood-burning appliances or air-filtration devices, would improve health measures, in particular Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQLQ) scores, relative to placebo, among children living with asthma in homes with wood-burning stoves. METHODS: A three-arm placebo-controlled randomized trial was conducted in homes with wood-burning stoves among children with asthma. Multiple preintervention and postintervention data included PAQLQ (primary outcome), peak expiratory flow (PEF) monitoring, diurnal peak flow variability (dPFV, an indicator of airway hyperreactivity) and indoor particulate matter (PM) PM2:5. RESULTS: Relative to placebo, neither the air filter nor the woodstove intervention showed improvement in quality-of-life measures. Among the secondary outcomes, dPFV showed a 4.1 percentage point decrease in variability [95%confidence interval (CI)= -7:8 to -0:4] for air-filtration use in comparison with placebo. The air-filter intervention showed a 67% (95% CI: 50% to 77%) reduction in indoor PM2:5, but no change was observed with the improved-technology woodstove intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Among children with asthma and chronic exposure to woodsmoke, an air-filter intervention that improved indoor air quality did not affect quality-of-life measures. Intent-to-treat analysis did show an improvement in the secondary measure of dPFV.

AB  - Introductıon: Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children. It is known that seasonal changes affect the number of asthma attacks and the condition of the disease under control as well. We evaluated children aged 6-11 years of age who had been diagnosed with asthma using the childhood asthma control test (C-ACT) to determine the factors affecting the control of asthma. Methods: One hundred and three follow-up cases diagnosed with asthma between the ages of 6--11 were included. All cases were asked to fill in the C-ACT and the asthmatic questionnaire that we had prepared to evaluate the patients. Results: It was determined that the 47.5% of the cases (n=49) were under control according to the results of the C-ACT. The number of annual attacks in the group under control (median=2/year, minimum=0/year,maximum=10/year) was significantly less than for the uncontrolled cases (median=3.5/year, minimum=0/year, maximum=10/year) (p=0.005). We determined that 14.3% (n=7) of the families of the group under control and 38.9% (n=21) of the families of the uncontrolled cases had a history of eczema (p=0.005). The hospital admission rates of the group under control were found to be 30.6% (n=15) in September, 32.7% (n=16) in October, 30.6% (n=15) in November, and 6.10% (n=3) in December, and the rates for the uncontrolled cases were 5.6% (n=3) in September, 25.9% (n=14) in October, 33.3% (n=18) in November, and 35.2% (n=19) in December. We detected that the uncontrolled cases were admitted more frequently than the ones under control in December (p=0.001). Dıscussıon and Conclusıon: C-ACT is a practical application that helps physicians with the follow-up of patients. We have determined in our study that a significant percentage of the asthmatics are uncontrolled cases. We estimated that the increase of complaints in December in patients with asthma may be related to regional climatic changes as well as environmental conditions.
AB  - Giriş ve Amaç: Astım çocukluk çağında en sık görülen kronik hastalıktır. Mevsimsel değişikliklerin, astım atak sayıları ve hastalığın kontrol altında olma durumunu etkilediği bilinmektedir. BU çalışmada astım tanılı 6-11 yaş arasındaki olguların çocukluk çağı astım kontrol testi (Ç-AKT) ile değerlendirilmesi ve astım kontrolünü etkileyen faktörlerin belirlenmesi amaçlanmıştır. Yöntem ve Gereçler: Çalışmaya astım tanısıyla takipli 6-11 yaş arası 103 olgu alındı. Olgulardan Çocukluk Çağı Astım Kontrol Testi (Ç-AKT) ve tarafımızca hastaların değerlendirilmesi için düzenlenen astımlı anketini doldurmaları istendi. Bulgular: Çocukluk çağı astım kontrol testi (Ç-AKT) sonucuna göre olguların %47,5'inin (n=49) kontrol altında olduğu saptandı. Kontrol altında olan grupta yıllık atak sayısı (medyan=2/yıl, minimum=0/yıl, maksimum=10/yıl) kontrol altında olmayan gruba göre ( medyan=3,5/yıl, minimum=0/yıl, maksimum=10/yıl) anlamlı olarak azdı (p=0,005). Kontrol altında olan olguların %14,3'ünün (n=7), kontrol altında olmayan olguların %38,9'unun (n=21) ailesinde egzama öyküsü olduğu tespit edildi (p=0,005). Hastaneye başvuru oranları kontrol altında olan olgularda: Eylül ayında %30,6 (n=15), Ekim ayında %32,7 (n=16), Kasım ayında %30,6 (n=15) ve Aralık ayında %6,10 (n=3); kontrol altında olmayan olgularda Eylül ayında %5,6 (n=3), Ekim ayında %25,9 (n=14), Kasım ayında %33,3 (n=18) ve Aralık ayında %35,2 (n=19) olarak saptandı. Aralık ayında kontrol altında olmayan olguların, kontrol altında olan olgulara göre daha sık başvurduğu tespit edildi (p=0,001). Tartışma ve Sonuç: Astım kontrol testleri hastaların takiplerinde hekimlere yardımcı olan pratik bir uygulamadır. Çalışma sonucunda astımlı hastaların önemli bir kısmının kontrol altında olmadığı görüldü. Astımlı olgularda Aralık ayında yakınmalarda görülen artışın bölgesel iklim değişiklikleri ve çevresel faktörlere bağlı olabileceği düşünüldü.

AB  - Higher asthma rates are one of the more obvious ways that health inequalities between African American and other children are manifested beginning in early childhood. In 2010, black asthma rates were double non-black rates. Some but not all of this difference can be explained by factors such as a higher incidence of low birth weight (LBW) among blacks; however, even conditional on LBW, blacks have a higher incidence of asthma than others. Using a unique data set based on the health records of all children born in New Jersey between 2006 and 2010, we show that when we split the data by whether or not children live in a "black" zip code, this racial difference in the incidence of asthma among LBW children entirely disappears. All LBW children in these zip codes, regardless of race, have a higher incidence of asthma. Our results point to the importance of residential segregation and neighborhoods in explaining persistent racial health disparities.

METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind controlled trial of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) supplementation on the cumulative incidence of eczema (primary end point) and asthma and rhinitis (secondary end points) in high-risk infants. For the first 6 months of life, intervention infants (n = 92) received a daily dose of 10 billion colony- forming units of LGG and 225 mg of inulin (Amerifit Brands, Cromwell, CT), and control infants (n = 92) received 325 mg of inulin alone. We used survival analysis methods to estimate disease incidences in the presence or absence of LGG and to estimate the efficacy of LGG in delaying or preventing these diseases. RESULTS: Infants were accrued over a 6-year period (median follow-up: 4.6 years; 95% retention rate at 2 years). At 2 years of age, the estimated cumulative incidence of eczema was 30.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 21.4%-40.4%) in the control arm and 28.7% (95% CI, 19.4%-38.0%) in the LGG arm, for a hazard ratio of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.59-1.53) (log-rank P = .83). At 5 years of age, the cumulative incidence of asthma was 17.4% (95% CI, 7.6%-27.1%) in the control arm and 9.7% (95% CI, 2.7%-16.6%) in the LGG arm, for a hazard ratio of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.41-1.87) (log-rank P = .25). CONCLUSIONS: For high-risk infants, early LGG supplementation for the first 6 months of life does not appear to prevent the development of eczema or asthma at 2 years of age.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the correlation between serum levels of IL-17 and IL-35 and the presence and severity of childhood asthma. The study was performed on 60 diagnosed asthmatic children, who were further classified into four groups according to the Global Initiative for Asthma Guidelines for Asthma Severity and Control (GINA) 2016, plus 30 age- and sex-matched apparently healthy children. All participants were subjected to full medical history, clinical examination, pulmonary function tests and laboratory evaluation in the form of complete blood count (CBC), serum total IgE, IL-17 and IL-35 by ELISA. Our results revealed that eosinophils count, IgE and IL-17 were significantly higher in the asthmatic group than the control group (p < .001), while IL-35 levels were significantly lower in asthmatics than control (p < .001). A strong negative correlation was found between serum IL-17 and serum IL-35; a positive correlation was found between serum IL-17 and both of serum total IgE and eosinophils counts in atopic asthmatic patients, and serum IL-35 showed significant negative correlations with both. ROC analysis of the data showed that the cut-off value of IL-35 level was <189.5 pg/mL and for IL-17 level, it was >13.1 pg/mL; this value could predict childhood asthma with sensitivity of 81.7% and 83.3%, and specificity of 76.7% and 70%, respectively. A combination of both cytokines yielded an increase in sensitivity to 95%. In conclusion, in the current study, IL-17 is upregulated while IL-35 is downregulated in childhood asthma with a significant negative correlation between both. These results suggest that both may play an important role in the pathogenesis of childhood asthma.

AB  - Rationale: Difficulty of asthma ascertainment and its associated methodologic heterogeneity have created significant barriers to asthma care and research.Objectives: We evaluated the validity of an existing natural language processing (NLP) algorithm for asthma criteria to enable an automated chart review using electronic medical records (EMRs).Methods: The study was designed as a retrospective birth cohort study using a random sample of 500 subjects from the 1997-2007 Mayo Birth Cohort who were born at Mayo Clinic and enrolled in primary pediatric care at Mayo Clinic Rochester. Performance of NLP-based asthma ascertainment using predetermined asthma criteria was assessed by determining both criterion validity (chart review of EMRs by abstractor as a gold standard) and construct validity (association with known risk factors for asthma, such as allergic rhinitis).Measurements and Main Results: After excluding three subjects whose respiratory symptoms could be attributed to other conditions (e.g., tracheomalacia), among the remaining eligible 497 subjects, 51% were male, 77% white persons, and the median age at last follow-up date was 11.5 years. The asthma prevalence was 31% in the study cohort. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for NLP algorithm in predicting asthma status were 97%, 95%, 90%, and 98%, respectively. The risk factors for asthma (e.g., allergic rhinitis) that were identified either by NLP or the abstractor were the same.Conclusions: Asthma ascertainment through NLP should be considered in the era of EMRs because it can enable large-scale clinical studies in a more time-efficient manner and improve the recognition and care of childhood asthma in practice.

AB  - We estimated the association between bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination and childhood asthma in a birth cohort using administrative databases, and we determined the impact of adjusting for potential confounders collected from a subset of the cohort members. Data were collected in 2 waves: 1) Administrative data for 76,623 individuals (stage 1) was gathered from the Quebec Birth Cohort on Immunity and Health (1974-1994), including BCG vaccination status, perinatal and sociodemographic characteristics, and use of health services for asthma; and 2) self-reported asthma risk factors were collected in 2012 by telephone interviews with 1,643 participants (stage 2) using a balanced 2-stage sampling design. We estimated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for asthma using logistic regression and correcting for the known sampling fractions from stage 1 to stage 2, overall and sex-stratified. In total, 35,612 (46.5%) individuals were BCG vaccinated, and 5,870 (7.7%) had asthma. The final odds ratio, integrating results from both stages of sampling, was 0.95 (95% confidence interval: 0.87, 1.04). Results did not differ according to sex (P for interaction = 0.327). To our knowledge, this is the largest study ever conducted on this topic, and using the best possible comprehensive adjustment for confounders, we found no association between BCG vaccination and asthma.

AB  - Purpose: Racial disparities in childhood asthma prevalence increased after the 1990s. Obesity, which also varies by race/ethnicity, is an asthma risk factor but its contribution to asthma prevalence disparities is unknown.Methods: We analyzed nationally representative National Health Examination and Nutrition Survey data for 2-19 year olds with logistic regression and decomposition analyses to assess the contributions of weight status to racial disparities in asthma prevalence, controlling for sex, age, and income status.Results: From 1988-1994 to 2011-2014, asthma prevalence increased more among non-Hispanic black (NHB) (8.4% to 18.0%) than non-Hispanic white (NHW) youth (7.2% to 10.3%). Logistic regression showed that obesity was an asthma risk factor for all groups but that a three-way "weight status-race/ethnicity-time" interaction was not significant. That is, weight status did not modify the race/ethnicity association with asthma over time. In decomposition analyses, weight status had a small contribution to NHB/NHW asthma prevalence disparities but most of the disparity remained unexplained by weight status or other asthma risk factors (sex, age and income status).Conclusions: NHB youth had a greater asthma prevalence increase from 1988-1994 to 2011-2014 than NHW youth. Most of the racial disparity in asthma prevalence remained unexplained after considering weight status and other characteristics.

AB  - Background It is unclear as to whether sleep respiratory breathing disorder ( SRBD) is a risk factor for uncontrolled asthma in children. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate whether SRBD may have an adverse effect on childhood asthma control and lung function measures. Methods This was a cross-sectional study of 220 children with well-controlled ( n = 108), partly controlled ( n = 92), and uncontrolled asthma ( n = 20) according to the Global Initiative for Asthma guideline. SRBD was assessed using the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire ( PSQ). The association of SRBD with partly controlled/uncontrolled asthma was investigated on multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results Of 220 children with asthma, 43 (19.6%) had SRBD: well-controlled, 16.7% (18/108); partly controlled, 21.7% (20/92); and uncontrolled, 25.0% (5/20; P = 0.54). There was a significant difference in forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity ( FEV1/ FVC; P = 0.007) and childhood asthma control test (C- ACT) score ( P < 0.001) according to asthma control status, but not in PSQ score ( P = 0.18). Children with obstructive sleep apnea ( PSQ >0.33) had a lower C- ACT score compared with controls ( PSQ ≤0.33; 19.6 ± 5.1 vs 22.0 ± 4.2, P = 0.002). PSQ score was negatively correlated with FEV1/ FVC ( r = −0.16, P = 0.02). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, high PSQ score increased the odds of having partly controlled/uncontrolled asthma by 9.12 (95% CI: 1.04-79.72, P = 0.046) after adjusting for confounding factors. Conclusion SRBD is an independent risk factor for partly controlled/uncontrolled asthma and has an adverse effect on lung function measures in children. Further research is warranted to determine whether the improvement of sleep quality may also enhance level of asthma control and lung function in children.

AB  - The authors report a case of a 30-year-old nulliparous woman with a prior medical history of asthma who developed intrapartum pneumomediastinum with surgical emphysema during the second stage of labour. She was managed conservatively with supportive care and there was complete resolution of symptoms within 4 days. Clinical and radiological findings were consistent with Hamman’s syndrome (spontaneous pneumomediastinum). This case reiterates the possibility of childhood asthma or a family history of asthma as being an associated risk factor for Hamman’s syndrome and reminds us of the need to distinguish such clinical findings from more important and potentially lifethreatening conditions such as oesophageal rupture, pulmonary embolism and aortic dissection that can present with similar findings.

AB  - Several studies have found an association between overweight and asthma, yet the temporal relationship between their onsets remains unclear. We investigated the development of body mass index (BMI) from birth to adolescence among 2,818 children with and without asthma from a Swedish birth cohort study, the BAMSE (a Swedish acronym for "children, allergy, milieu, Stockholm, epidemiology") Project, during 1994-2013. Measured weight and height were available at 13 time points throughout childhood. Asthma phenotypes (transient, persistent, and late-onset) were defined by timing of onset and remission. Quantile regression was used to analyze percentiles of BMI, and generalized estimating equations were used to analyze the association between asthma phenotypes and the risk of high BMI. Among females, BMI development differed between children with and without asthma, with the highest BMI being seen among females with persistent asthma. The difference existed throughout childhood but increased with age. For example, females with persistent asthma had 2.33 times' (95% confidence interval: 1.21, 4.49) greater odds of having a BMI above the 85th percentile at age ≥15 years than females without asthma. Amongmales, no clear associations between asthma and BMI were observed. In this study, persistent asthma was associated with high BMI throughout childhood among females, whereas no consistent association was observed among males.

AB  - Background: Developmental Origins of Health and Disease Hypothesis (DOHaD) studies are often observational in nature and are therefore prone to biases from loss to follow-up and unmeasured confounding. Register-based studies can reduce these issues since they allow almost complete follow-up and provide information on fathers that can be used in a negative control analysis to assess the impact of unmeasured confounding. Aim: The aim of this study was to propose a causal model for testing DOHaD using paternal exposure as a negative control, and its application to maternal distress in pregnancy and offspring asthma. Methods: A causal diagram including shared and parent-specific measured and unmeasured confounders for maternal (fetal) and paternal exposures is proposed. The case study consisted of all children born in Sweden from July 2006 to December 2008 (n=254,150). Information about childhood asthma, parental distress and covariates was obtained from the Swedish national health registers. Associations between maternal and paternal distress during pregnancy and offspring asthma at age five years were assessed separately and with mutual adjustment for the other parent’s distress measure, as well as for shared confounders. Results: Maternal distress during pregnancy was associated with offspring asthma risk; mutually adjusted odds ratio (OR) (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.23, 1.43). The mutually adjusted paternal distress−offspring asthma analysis (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.97, 1.13) indicated no evidence for unmeasured confounding shared by the mother and father. Conclusions: Using paternal exposure in a negative control model to test the robustness of fetal programming hypotheses can be a relatively simple extension of conventional observational studies but limitations need to be considered.

AB  - Objectives: Cognitive empathy in parents--reflecting the extent to which one considers the perspectives and emotions of others--is hypothesized to contribute to family social environments in ways that affect youths' physical health. Using a novel assessment technique for cognitive empathy, the current study examined associations between spontaneous parental perspective-taking and key inflammatory processes implicated in pediatric asthma. Method: One hundred thirty children (ages 9-17) with physician-diagnosed asthma, along with 1 parent, participated in the current study. Parents completed an interview from which statements of perspective-taking were coded and youths provided blood samples. Results: Youths whose parents demonstrated greater spontaneous perspective-taking during the interview had cells that mounted smaller inflammatory responses to stimulation by nonspecific, asthma-specific, and viral analogue ligands, as well as cells that showed greater sensitivity to the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids. These results were not accounted for by parental warmth or parent or youth depressive symptoms, nor by covariates of race, age, gender, parental education level, use of asthma medications over the past week, or asthma severity. Conclusions: These findings suggest that parental perspective-taking may have implications for biological processes relevant to childhood asthma.

AB  - Background Childhood chronic physical illness is associated with a greater vulnerability for emotional problems (i.e. depression and anxiety) in childhood. However, little is known about life-long effects of childhood chronic physical illness on mental health. The present study aims to systematically review evidence for associations between eight chronic physical illnesses with childhood onset (arthritis, asthma, cancer, chronic renal failure, congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis, type 1 diabetes, and epilepsy) and adult emotional problems. Methods A database search of MEDLINE, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, and ScienceDirect was undertaken, and random effects meta-analyses were used to synthesise evidence from eligible studies. Results In total, 37 studies were eligible for the systematic review ( n = 45,733) and of these, 34 studies were included in the meta-analyses ( n = 45,358). There were overall associations between childhood chronic physical illness and adult depression (OR = 1.31; 95% CI [1.12, 1.54]) and anxiety (OR = 1.47; 95% CI [1.13, 1.92]). Separate meta-analyses for childhood asthma, type 1 diabetes and cancer were also conducted, with cancer being significantly associated with adult depression (OR = 1.19; 95% CI [1.00, 1.42]). Conclusions The effects of childhood chronic physical illness on the risk of emotional problems persist beyond childhood and adolescence. Mental health prevention and intervention strategies targeting children with chronic physical illnesses can have long-term benefits.

AB  - Childhood asthma is a common condition where there is no consensus on definition, no diagnostic test and no reliable test to monitor symptoms. Despite (or because of) these considerable clinical challenges, many national bodies produce guidelines for the diagnosis and management of childhood asthma. The British Thoracic Society and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (BTS/SIGN) published their first asthma guideline in 1995 and have updated regularly, and most recently in 2016. The present article will (i) summarise changes in the BTS/SIGN asthma guideline between 1995 and 2014 and (ii) highlight what has changed between 2014 and 2016. The guideline has evolved considerably over 21 years, but the core principles for diagnosis and management have remained constant. The major changes to the 2016 guideline include (i) the initial trial of treatment should be with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (ii) there is new terminology for the dose of ICS (iii) there are new recommendations for the traditional “steps” 1 to 3 and (iv) the 5–12 and less than 5 year old stepwise algorithms in the 2014 guideline are now unified. For acute severe asthma, the first choice intravenous treatment is magnesium sulphate. Childhood asthma remains a clinical diagnosis where management is symptom-based and patient-focussed.

AB  - Objective: To identify prenatal and perinatal risk factors for childhood asthma.Methods: A retrospective case-control study was undertaken among children aged 7-14 years in Tehran, Iran, between March 2009 and November 2014. Data for children with asthma (Iranian nationality, non-smoking parents, and middle-class socioeconomic status) were compared with those for an equal number of age- and sex-matched non-asthmatic children. Prenatal and perinatal risk factors were evaluated via complete data sheets of maternal pregnancy and delivery. Forward logistic regression analysis was performed.Results: Both groups contained 134 children. Risk of asthma was shown to be associated with maternal history of asthma (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 11.62, 95% confidence interval 1.38-96.93; P=0.024), vaginal bleeding during pregnancy (aOR 3.76, 95% CI 1.86-7.57; P<0.001), antibiotics during pregnancy (aOR 3.19, 95% CI 1.52-6.67; P=0.002), and maternal age 30 years or older (aOR 2.54, 95% CI 1.30-4.95; P=0.006). Breastfeeding was protective against childhood asthma (aOR 0.29, 95% CI 0.151-0.575; P<0.001).Conclusion: History of maternal asthma was the most influential factor on development of childhood asthma, followed by vaginal bleeding during pregnancy, antibiotic exposure in utero, and older maternal age.

AB  - Rationale: The evidence supporting an association between traffic-related air pollution exposure and incident childhood asthma is inconsistent and may depend on genetic factors.Objectives: To identify gene-environment interaction effects on childhood asthma using genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data and air pollution exposure. Identified loci were further analyzed at epigenetic and transcriptomic levels.Methods: We used land use regression models to estimate individual air pollution exposure (represented by outdoor NO2 levels) at the birth address and performed a genome-wide interaction study for doctors' diagnoses of asthma up to 8 years in three European birth cohorts (n = 1,534) with look-up for interaction in two separate North American cohorts, CHS (Children's Health Study) and CAPPS/SAGE (Canadian Asthma Primary Prevention Study/Study of Asthma, Genetics and Environment) (n = 1,602 and 186 subjects, respectively). We assessed expression quantitative trait locus effects in human lung specimens and blood, as well as associations among air pollution exposure, methylation, and transcriptomic patterns.Measurements and Main Results: In the European cohorts, 186 SNPs had an interaction P < 1 × 10-4 and a look-up evaluation of these disclosed 8 SNPs in 4 loci, with an interaction P < 0.05 in the large CHS study, but not in CAPPS/SAGE. Three SNPs within adenylate cyclase 2 (ADCY2) showed the same direction of the interaction effect and were found to influence ADCY2 gene expression in peripheral blood (P = 4.50 × 10-4). One other SNP with P < 0.05 for interaction in CHS, rs686237, strongly influenced UDP-Gal:betaGlcNAc β-1,4-galactosyltransferase, polypeptide 5 (B4GALT5) expression in lung tissue (P = 1.18 × 10-17). Air pollution exposure was associated with differential discs, large homolog 2 (DLG2) methylation and expression.Conclusions: Our results indicated that gene-environment interactions are important for asthma development and provided supportive evidence for interaction with air pollution for ADCY2, B4GALT5, and DLG2.

AB  - Background: Low circulating vitamin D levels have been associated with risk of asthma, atopic dermatitis, and elevated total immunoglobulin E (IgE). These epidemiological associations, if true, would have public health importance, since vitamin D insufficiency is common and correctable.Methods and Findings: We aimed to test whether genetically lowered vitamin D levels were associated with risk of asthma, atopic dermatitis, or elevated serum IgE levels, using Mendelian randomization (MR) methodology to control bias owing to confounding and reverse causation. The study employed data from the UK Biobank resource and from the SUNLIGHT, GABRIEL and EAGLE eczema consortia. Using four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) strongly associated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels in 33,996 individuals, we conducted MR studies to estimate the effect of lowered 25OHD on the risk of asthma (n = 146,761), childhood onset asthma (n = 15,008), atopic dermatitis (n = 40,835), and elevated IgE level (n = 12,853) and tested MR assumptions in sensitivity analyses. None of the four 25OHD-lowering alleles were associated with asthma, atopic dermatitis, or elevated IgE levels (p ≥ 0.2). The MR odds ratio per standard deviation decrease in log-transformed 25OHD was 1.03 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90-1.19, p = 0.63) for asthma, 0.95 (95% CI 0.69-1.31, p = 0.76) for childhood-onset asthma, and 1.12 (95% CI 0.92-1.37, p = 0.27) for atopic dermatitis, and the effect size on log-transformed IgE levels was -0.40 (95% CI -1.65 to 0.85, p = 0.54). These results persisted in sensitivity analyses assessing population stratification and pleiotropy and vitamin D synthesis and metabolism pathways. The main limitations of this study are that the findings do not exclude an association between the studied outcomes and 1,25-dihydoxyvitamin D, the active form of vitamin D, the study was underpowered to detect effects smaller than an OR of 1.33 for childhood asthma, and the analyses were restricted to white populations of European ancestry. This research has been conducted using the UK Biobank Resource and data from the SUNLIGHT, GABRIEL and EAGLE Eczema consortia.Conclusions: In this study, we found no evidence that genetically determined reduction in 25OHD levels conferred an increased risk of asthma, atopic dermatitis, or elevated total serum IgE, suggesting that efforts to increase vitamin D are unlikely to reduce risks of atopic disease.

AB  - The worldwide prevalence of childhood asthma has been increasing considerably, and the protection afforded by breastfeeding in its development has been the subject of controversy for more than 80 years. Previous systematic reviews have generally found a protective effect of breastfeeding on allergic outcomes, although many studies have methodological limitations. Although breastfeeding is protective against lower respiratory tract infection during infancy, such protection has not been demonstrated for asthma in all studies. Breastfeeding has health benefits for the mother and child. Exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of an infant's life, with continued breastfeeding for up to 2 years or longer, is recognized as the "gold" standard for infant feeding because human milk is uniquely suited to the human infant, and its nutritional content and bioactivity promote a healthy development. There is increasing concern that the practice of delaying complementary foods until 6 months may exacerbate the risk of allergic disease. Breast milk contains immunological components that protect against infections and allergic disease in infancy. The composition of human breast milk is complex, containing factors that interact with the infant immune system and intestinal milieu including allergens, cytokines, immunoglobulins, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and chemokines. Transforming growth factor β is a cytokine in human milk involved in maintaining intestinal homeostasis, inflammation regulation, and oral tolerance development. Modern day society, with increased standards of hygiene, has changed the gut flora of Western infants, potentially impacting the risk of developing immune-mediated diseases including allergic disease and asthma. Microbial diversity is intrinsic to healthy immune maturation and function. Compared to breastfed infants, formula-fed infants had lower bacterial diversity and an altered intestinal microbiota in the first few weeks of life associated with an increased risk of eczema and asthma. Favorable gut colonization through continued breastfeeding may promote tolerance as well as protection when complementary feeding is initiated.

AB  - Rationale: Asthma and obesity often occur together in children. It is unknown whether asthma contributes to the childhood obesity epidemic.Objectives: We aimed to investigate the effects of asthma and asthma medication use on the development of childhood obesity.Methods: The primary analysis was conducted among 2,171 nonobese children who were 5-8 years of age at study enrollment in the Southern California Children's Health Study (CHS) and were followed for up to 10 years. A replication analysis was performed in an independent sample of 2,684 CHS children followed from a mean age of 9.7 to 17.8 years.Measurements and Main Results: Height and weight were measured annually to classify children into normal, overweight, and obese categories. Asthma status was ascertained by parent- or self-reported physician-diagnosed asthma. Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to assess associations of asthma history with obesity incidence during follow-up. We found that children with a diagnosis of asthma at cohort entry were at 51% increased risk of developing obesity during childhood and adolescence compared with children without asthma at baseline (hazard ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-2.10) after adjusting for confounders. Use of asthma rescue medications at cohort entry reduced the risk of developing obesity (hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.96). In addition, the significant association between a history of asthma and an increased risk of developing obesity was replicated in an independent CHS sample.Conclusions: Children with asthma may be at higher risk of obesity. Asthma rescue medication use appeared to reduce obesity risk independent of physical activity.

AB  - Background: The Control of Allergic Rhinitis and Asthma Test for Children (CARATKids) assesses asthma and allergic rhinitis control in children younger than 12 years.Objective: To validate the Brazilian Portuguese version of the CARATKids and to define the cutoff values for identifying uncontrolled disease.Methods: Children aged 6 to 12 years with asthma and allergic rhinitis were studied (n = 102). CARATKids, childhood Asthma Control Test (cACT), total nasal symptom score (TNSS), and visual analog scale (VAS) scores were obtained at baseline and after 4 to 6 weeks. Internal consistency, test-retest reliability, responsiveness, and validity of the Brazilian CARATKids were assessed according to the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurements Instruments checklist. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was evaluated using distribution and anchor methods. Spearman correlations were used to compare CARATKids scores with external measures of control. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to establish cutoff values.Results: Fifty children completed both visits. The Cronbach α and intraclass correlation coefficient of CARATKids were 0.81 and 0.85, respectively. The Guyatt responsiveness index was -1.34, and within-patient change in clinically unstable patients (n = 31) was significant (P = .02). As for cross-sectional and longitudinal validity, correlation coefficients ranged from 0.58 to 0.77 (P < .001) and 0.30 to 0.57 (P < .05), respectively. The estimated MCID for CARATKids was 3. The optimal cutoffs (sensitivity and specificity) to exclude uncontrolled and controlled disease were 3 or less (97% and 67%) and 6 or greater (56% and 96%), respectively.Conclusion: CARATKids is a reliable and valid tool to assess asthma and allergic rhinitis control in Brazilian children. A score of 6 or higher on CARATKids identifies uncontrolled disease, and a score of 3 or lower excludes poor disease control.

AB  - Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and asthma are among the most common chronic disorders in childhood. Both are associated with altered immune regulation and share several risk factors. The effects of ASD on risk for later asthma and asthma severity remain unclear.Objective: To determine whether ASD in children increases the risk of incident asthma and worsens asthma severity.Methods: We performed 2 distinct analytic designs (case-control and retrospective longitudinal cohort) using a multistate electronic health records database to assess the odds of new asthma and asthma severity among children with ASD. In both designs, children with ASD were matched with children without ASD according to sex, age, race, ethnicity, location, and insurance status. Pulmonary function, controller medication prescriptions, asthma exacerbations, and asthma-related hospitalizations were collected. The effects of ASD on asthma risk and severity were assessed using multivariable linear and logistic regression.Results: Among children with asthma, ASD was associated with reduced exacerbations (odds ratio [OR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-0.92), better forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity ratio (0.876 vs 0.841, P < .001), and lower odds of airflow obstruction (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.31-0.90) but had higher odds of asthma controller prescription (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.62-2.93). In a longitudinal analysis of children without asthma, ASD was found to be protective for new asthma (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.26-0.74).Conclusion: Among children with asthma, concomitant ASD is associated with better asthma-related outcomes but a higher controller treatment burden. In addition, our data did not support ASD as a risk factor for incident asthma.

AB  - We compared results of a modified version of the Asthma Control Test using parent proxy report (PP-ACT) with results reported by children and parents using the validated Childhood–Asthma Control Test (C-ACT). 104 parent-child dyads with a child aged 6 to 12 years with asthma were randomized to complete PP-ACT followed by C-ACT or C-ACT followed by PP-ACT. Scores ≤19 indicated uncontrolled asthma. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for the PP-ACT in comparison with the C-ACT, and calculated concordance between the 2 scales. The PP-ACT had sensitivity of 86% and negative predictive value of 88% for detecting uncontrolled asthma. More than 75% of surveys were concordant (κ = 0.54, moderate agreement). Our results suggest that while the PP-ACT missed few children with uncontrolled asthma and may simplify reporting of asthma control in circumstances when child report is not feasible or creates barriers to survey receipt, limitations of proxy reporting should be considered.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: This review will catalog the many recent longitudinal studies that have investigated the relationship between asthma and lung function, or the persistence and trajectories of lung function deficits.Recent Findings: Recent work has reported on 50-year follow-ups of some prominent population cohorts. A history of asthma confers a 10-30-fold risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Individuals reaching a reduced maximum growth of forced expiratory volume in 1 s in early adulthood are at risk for early or more severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Summary: Taken together, there is a wealth of overlapping cohort studies of lung function, asthma and COPD. These show that asthma is associated with reduced lung function, which may start in infancy or prenatally, persists through childhood and adulthood and predisposes for early or more severe COPD.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: Asthma exhibits significant heterogeneity in occurrence and severity over the lifespan. Our goal is to discuss recent evidence regarding determinants of the natural history of asthma during childhood, and review the rationale behind and status of major efforts to alter its course.Recent Findings: Variations in microbial exposures are associated with risk of allergic disease, and the use of bacterial lysates may be a promising preventive strategy. Exposure to air pollution appears to be particularly damaging in prenatal and early life, and interventions to reduce pollution are feasible and result in clinical benefit. E-cigarette use may have a role in harm reduction for conventional cigarette smokers with asthma, but has undefined short-term and long-term effects that must be clarified. Vitamin D insufficiency over the first several years of life is associated with risk of asthma, and vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of severe exacerbations.Summary: The identification of risk factors for asthma occurrence, persistence and severity will continue to guide efforts to alter the natural history of the disease. We have reviewed several promising strategies that are currently under investigation. Vitamin D supplementation and air pollution reduction have been shown to be effective strategies and warrant increased investigation and implementation.

AB  - Introduction: Meta-analyses of observational studies represent an important tool for assessing efficacy and safety in the pharmacoepidemiologic field. The data from the individual studies are either primary (i.e., collected through interviews or self-administered questionnaires) or secondary (i.e., collected from databases that were established for other purposes). So far, the origin of the data (primary vs. secondary) has not been systematically assessed as a source of heterogeneity in pharmacoepidemiologic meta-analyses.Objective: The aim was to assess the impact of considering the source of exposure data as a criterion in sensitivity and subgroup analysis on the conclusions of drug safety meta-analyses.Methods: We selected meta-analyses published between 2013 and 2015 in which the intake of frequently used over-the-counter medicines was either the main exposure or a concomitant treatment and the outcome had short latency and induction periods. We stratified the results by origin of data (primary vs. secondary) and compared the new results to those presented originally in the meta-analyses.Results: We used four meta-analyses that fulfilled our criteria of inclusion. The results were selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and upper gastrointestinal bleeding: original estimate odds ratio (OR) = 1.71 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.44-2.04], OR primary data = 1.19 (95% CI 0.90-1.58), OR secondary data = 1.81 (95% CI 1.50-2.17); proton pump inhibitors and cardiac events: original estimate hazard ratio (HR) = 1.35 (95% CI 1.18-1.54), HR primary data = 1.05 (95% CI 0.87-1.26), HR secondary data = 1.43 (95% CI 1.23-1.66); non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and myocardial infarction: original estimate risk ratio (RR) = 1.08 (95% CI 0.95-1.22), RR primary data = 0.57 (95% CI 0.34-0.96), RR secondary data = 1.15 (95% CI 1.03-1.28); paracetamol during pregnancy and childhood asthma: original estimate OR = 1.32 (95% CI 1.14-1.52), OR primary data = 1.23 (95% CI 1.06-1.42), OR secondary data = 1.53 (95% CI 1.33-1.75).Conclusions: The results after stratification are considerably modified. It is crucial to explore the origin of the data, either primary or secondary, as a source of heterogeneity in pharmacoepidemiologic meta-analyses to avoid misleading conclusions.

AB  - Background Migraine is a common cause of headache in childhood. Several studies have investigated the association between migraine and atopic diseases, mostly in the adult population. Objective This study aimed to investigate this association in children. Methods A case-control study was conducted across 3 European tertiary care hospitals between June 2014 and August 2014. Cases (n = 229) were children aged 6-18 years consulting for a migraine episode. Controls in the same age range (n = 406) were consulting for a minor injury and did not have a history of recurrent headache. Logistic regression analyses tested the effect of atopic diseases and anti-allergic therapies on occurrence of migraine. Results Children with migraine were more likely to have persistent asthma compared to absence of asthma (odds ratio [OR]: 4.57, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.04-10.24) and less likely to have been treated by inhaled or nasal corticosteroid (OR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.15-0.76) or antihistamine therapy (OR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.18-0.60). The median number of monthly migraine episodes was higher in children with persistent asthma (3; interquartile [IQR]: 1-4; range: 0.5-10) compared to children with intermittent asthma (2; IQR: 1-3; range: 0.1-4) or non-asthmatic children (2; IQR: 1-3; range: 0.1-12) ( P < .01). Conclusion Persistent childhood asthma was associated with increased risk of migraine and higher frequency of migraine attacks. History of anti-asthmatic or anti-allergic therapies was associated with decreased risk of migraine in children and adolescents. The role of these therapies on the pathogenesis and occurrence of migraine needs to be further elucidated because of the huge potential impact in terms of public health.

AB  - Background: Asthma is a growing health problem, especially among children in many countries. In Malaysia, its prevalence has been increasing over the years. More initiatives are needed to be done in order to strengthen the policy to reduce this problem. Objective: This research study was aimed to determine the risk factors of the quality of life among childhood asthma in primary health clinics in Melaka. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among children with asthma aged 7 to 17 years old and attending government primary health care clinics. A questionnaire from the Pediatric Asthma Quality Of Life Questionnaire (PAQLQ) was used in the study. Results: Male children with asthma and those on systemic steroids had shown an association with a higher quality of life score. Conclusion: The focus on gender and systemic steroids on asthma effect needed to be strengthened in asthma management in healthcare.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Both the social environment and the physical environment areincreasingly recognized as important to childhood diseases such as asthma. This study tested a novel hypothesis: that living in areas high in greenspace may help buffer the effects of difficult family relationships for children with asthma. METHODS: A total of 150 children (ages 9-17), physician-diagnosed with asthma, participated in this study. To assess difficulties in parent-child relationships, parents and children completed measures of harsh/inconsistent parenting and parental hostility. Residential greenspace was calculated by using satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index with a buffer of 250 m around the residential address. Outcomes included both clinical and biological measures: asthma control and functional limitations, as well as airway inflammation (fractional concentration of exhaled nitric oxide) and glucocorticoid receptor expression in T-helper cells. RESULTS: After controlling for potential confounding variables, including family income, child demographics, and child medical variables, few main effects were found. However, interactions between residential greenspace and difficult family relationships were found for asthma control (P = .02), asthma functional limitations (P = .04), airway inflammation (P = .007), and the abundance of glucocorticoid receptor in T-helper cells (P = .05). These interactions were all in a direction such that as the quality of parent-child relationships improved, greenspace became more strongly associated with better asthma outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest synergistic effects of positive environments across the physical and social domains. Children with asthma appear to benefit the most when they both live in high greenspace areas and have positive family relationships.

AB  - Background Early-life exposure to older siblings is associated with a lower risk of asthma. To date, no study has addressed the impact of having siblings on both the airway and fecal microbiota during infancy. The aim of this study was therefore to profile the nasal airway and fecal microbiota in infants, and to examine the association between having siblings and microbiota profile. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study of 105 healthy infants (aged <1 year). Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and an unbiased clustering approach to the nasal airway and fecal samples, we identified microbiota profiles and then determined the association between having siblings and microbiome profile. Results Overall, the median age was 3.4 months ( IQR, 2.0-4.7 months); 43% had siblings in the household. Unbiased clustering of nasal airway microbiota identified three profiles: Moraxella dominant (43%), Corynebacterium/Dolosigranulum dominant (36%), and mixed (21%). Infants with siblings were more likely to have a Moraxella-dominant profile than Corynebacterium/Dolosigranulum-dominant profile (76% vs 18%), while those without siblings had the opposite pattern (18% vs 50%; P < 0.001, multivariable-adjusted). Fecal microbiota consisted of three profiles: Bifidobacterium dominant (39%), Escherichia dominant (31%), and Enterobacter dominant (30%). Infants with siblings were more likely to have a Bifidobacterium-dominant profile than Escherichia-dominant profile (49% vs 24%) while those without siblings had the opposite pattern (32% vs 37%; P = 0.04, multivariable-adjusted). Conclusions In this cross-sectional study, infants with siblings were more likely to have a Moraxella-dominant nasal microbiota profile and Bifidobacterium-dominant fecal microbiota profile. These findings should facilitate further investigation of the interplay between early-life environmental exposure, the microbiome, and childhood asthma.

AB  - The oral condition is often overlooked and underappreciated as a crucial health risk factor, despite the fact that oral problems can have far-reaching effects on overall health and well-being. Dental caries (tooth decay) is the number 1 chronic condition among US children and is 5 times more prevalent than childhood asthma. However, oral healthcare is still the most common unmet healthcare need among children. Diet is the primary etiologic factor in the caries process. Unfortunately, the usual exhortation to "avoid sugar" or "avoid sweets" is meaningless because the dietary factors involved in the caries process are more complex than simply encompassing the general category of sweets. Thus, dietary guidelines must be provided to pediatric populations if dental caries is to be prevented. This article reviews the factors involved in dental caries--especially the dietary factors--in young children and provides strategies for preventing this serious disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine if racial disparities in pediatric asthma are explained by material hardship and home ownership. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of the 2011 American Housing Survey. A total of 33,201 households with children age 6 to 17 years were surveyed regarding childhood asthma diagnosis and emergency department (ED) visits for asthma (for the youngest child with asthma in the household). Material hardship included poor housing quality, housing crowding, lack of amenities, and no vehicle access. We used logistic regression to determine the association between race, material hardship, and asthma diagnosis or ED visits, adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Non-Hispanic black heads of household had a higher odds of having a child diagnosed with asthma in the home compared with non-Hispanic white heads of household (odds ratio, 1.72; 95% confidence interval [Cl], 1.50-1.96), and a higher odds of ED visits for asthma (odds ratio, 3.02; 95% Cl, 2.29-3.99). The race-asthma association was decreased but not eliminated after adjusting for material hardship and home ownership (ED visit adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.07; 95% Cl, 1.50-2.86). Poor housing quality was independently associated with asthma diagnosis (AOR, 1.45; 95% Cl, 1.28-1.66) and ED visits (AOR, 1.59; 95% Cl, 1.21-2.10). Home ownership was associated with a lower odds of asthma-related ED visits (AOR, 0.62; 95% Cl, 0.46-0.84). CONCLUSIONS: Observed racial disparities in pediatric asthma are lessened after controlling for material hardship. Poor housing quality in particular is strongly associated with asthma morbidity. Policy makers could target improving housing quality as a means of potentially reducing asthma disparities.

AB  - Rationale: The heterogeneity of asthma phenotypes may explain inconsistencies in observed associations with environmental exposures.Objectives: To identify trajectories of childhood asthma and to characterize the potential impact of residential greenness and air pollution on asthma trajectory subgroups.Methods: Linked administrative databases of medical visits were used to define the occurrence and recurrence of asthma over a 10-year follow-up period within a population-based birth cohort of more than 65,000 children. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify unique asthma trajectories. Weighted multinomial regression was used to assess the relationship between asthma trajectories and risk factors, including environmental exposures.Measurements and Main Results: Group-based trajectory modeling distinguished four trajectories: one with no asthma representing 88.8% of the cohort, one with transient asthma (5.6% of the cohort), and two trajectories with chronic asthma with early (<1 yr; 1.5%) and late (<3 yr; 4.1%) onset during early childhood. These trajectories differed with respect to socioeconomic markers and modifiable risk factors, including maternal smoking and breastfeeding initiation. After accounting for sex, parity, breastfeeding, term birth weight, household income, maternal education, delivery mode, and smoking, an interquartile increase in nitrogen dioxide exposure increased the risk of membership in the early and late-onset chronic asthma trajectories, relative to subjects without asthma, by 50% and 20%, respectively (weighted risk ratio, 1.5 and 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-1.9 and 1.0-1.4). Greenness was not associated with any of the asthma trajectories.Conclusions: Traffic-related air pollution increased the probability of a chronic asthma trajectory.

AB  - Rationale: Maternal depression and prenatal and early life stress may influence childhood wheezing illnesses, potentially through effects on immune development.Objectives: To test the hypothesis that maternal stress and/or depression during pregnancy and early life are associated with recurrent wheezing and aeroallergen sensitivity and altered cytokine responses (enhanced type 2 or reduced virus-induced cytokine responses) from stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells at age 3 years.Methods: URECA (Urban Environment and Childhood Asthma) is a birth cohort at high risk for asthma (n = 560) in four inner cities. Maternal stress, depression, and childhood wheezing episodes were assessed by quarterly questionnaires beginning at birth. Logistic and linear regression techniques were used to examine the relation of maternal stress/depression to recurrent wheezing and peripheral blood mononuclear cell cytokine responses at age 3 years.Measurements and Main Results: Overall, 166 (36%) children had recurrent wheeze at age 3 years. Measures of maternal perceived stress at Years 2 and 3 were positively associated with recurrent wheeze (P < 0.05). Maternal depression (any year) was significantly associated with recurrent wheezing (P ≤ 0.01). These associations were also significant when considered in a longitudinal analysis of cumulative stress and depression (P ≤ 0.02). Neither stress nor depression was significantly related to aeroallergen sensitization or antiviral responses. Contrary to our original hypothesis, prenatal and Year 1 stress and depression had significant inverse associations with several type 2 cytokine responses.Conclusions: In urban children at high risk for asthma, maternal perceived stress and depression were significantly associated with recurrent wheezing but not increased atopy or reduced antiviral responses.

AB  - Background: Because of time and cost constraints, objective classification of atopic and nonatopic asthma has been limited in large epidemiologic studies. However, as we try to better understand exposure-outcome associations and ensure appropriate treatment of asthma, it is important to focus on phenotype-defined asthma classification.Objective: To compare atopic and nonatopic asthma in rural children with regard to risk factors and clinical outcomes.Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in rural Saskatchewan, Canada, in 2011. Parents of 6- to 14-year-old children completed a health and exposure survey. Skin prick tests were completed in a subsample of 529 children. Asthma was based physician diagnosis. Asthma status was defined as no asthma, nonatopic asthma, and atopic asthma.Results: Asthma prevalence was 14.7% of which 32.1% of cases were atopic. After adjustment, early respiratory illness and a family history of asthma were predictors of childhood asthma, regardless of atopic status (P < .05). Being overweight and having a dog in the home were associated with an increased risk of nonatopic asthma (P < .05). A mother with a history of smoking increased the risk of atopic asthma (P = .01). Compared with those with nonatopic asthma, in the past 12 months, children with atopic asthma were more likely to report a sneezy, runny, or blocked nose or have shortness of breath (odds ratio >2), whereas those with nonatopic asthma were more likely to have parents who missed work (odd ratio >3). Those with nonatopic asthma had significantly lower forced expiratory volume in 1 second compared w2ith those with atopic asthma.Conclusion: Exposures may contribute differentially to atopic and nonatopic asthma and result in differential clinical presentation or burden. The study of these characteristics is important for etiologic understanding and management decisions.

AB  - Utilizing over 140,000 geocoded medical records for a diverse sample of children ages 2-12 living in Houston, Texas, we examine whether a comprehensive set of neighborhood social and environmental characteristics explain racial and ethnic disparities in childhood asthma. Adjusting for all individual risk factors, as well as neighborhood concentrated disadvantage, particulate matter, ozone concentration, and race/ethnic composition, reduced but did not fully attenuate the higher odds of asthma diagnosis among black (OR=2.59, 95% CI=2.39, 2.80), Hispanic (OR=1.22, 95% CI=1.14, 1.32) and Asian (OR=1.18, 95% CI=1.04, 1.33) children relative to whites.

AB  - The Oncology Grand Rounds series is designed to place original reports published in the Journal into clinical context. A case presentation is followed by a description of diagnostic and management challenges, a review of the relevant literature, and a summary of the authors' suggested management approaches. The goal of this series is to help readers better understand how to apply the results of key studies, including those published in Journal of Clinical Oncology, to patients seen in their own clinical practice. A 60-year-old former smoker with metastatic melanoma presented with the chief complaint of pulmonary infiltrates. Five years ago, he was diagnosed with a left chest wall melanoma. He underwent surgery but received no additional therapy for an American Joint Committee on Cancer stage T3a N0 M0 tumor that was 2.7 mm in depth with no ulceration of the epidermal surface. Resection margins were free of tumor. Four years later, he underwent excision of a raised pigmented skin lesion on his left calf that proved to be melanoma with positive margins. He underwent re-excision of melanoma but 2 months later developed a new left hip soft tissue nodule. Positron emission tomography (PET) -computed tomography showed multiple hypermetabolic lesions involving subcutaneous tissue, muscle osseous structures, and bone marrow, consistent with advanced melanoma. He began systemic therapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab. After four cycles of immunotherapy, he developed a nonproductive cough and mild dyspnea on exertion (Modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale score of 2 [ie, he had to stop for breath when walking at his own pace on level ground]). A chest x-ray showed bilateral hilar enlargement, thickening of the right paratracheal stripe, and scattered patchy increased interstitial markings bilaterally. PET and chest computed tomography images showed enlarged mediastinal adenopathy with increased [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on PET and scattered diffuse 1- to 2-mm pulmonary nodules with ground-glass opacities ( Fig 1 ). The patient was referred for pulmonary input. The patient had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 35 years; he quit 6 years ago. He had no history of pneumonia, childhood asthma, or tuberculosis. His mother had asthma, but there was no other family history of asthma or other lung disease.

AB  - Background: Secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure is a modifiable risk factor associated with childhood asthma. Associations with adolescent asthma and the relevance of the timing and patterns of exposure are unclear. Knowledge of critical windows of exposure is important for targeted interventions.Methods: We used data until age 17 from 1454 children of the Dutch population-based PIAMA birth cohort. Residential SHS exposure was assessed through parental questionnaires completed at ages 3 months, 1-8 (yearly), 11, 14, and 17 years. Lifetime exposure was determined as; a) time window-specific exposure (prenatal, infancy, preschool, primary school, and secondary school); b) lifetime cumulative exposure; c) longitudinal exposure patterns using latent class growth modeling (LCGM). Generalized estimation equations and logistic regression were used to analyze associations between exposure and asthma at ages 4 to 17 years, adjusting for potential confounders.Results: With all three methods, we consistently found no association between SHS exposure and asthma at ages 4 to 17 years e.g. adjusted overall odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 0.67 (0.41-1.12), 1.00 (0.66-1.51) and 0.67 (0.41-1.11) for prenatal maternal active smoking, infancy, and preschool school time window exposures, respectively.Conclusion: We assessed lifetime SHS exposure using different methods. Different timing and patterns of SHS exposure were not associated with an increased risk of asthma in childhood and adolescence in our study. More longitudinal studies could investigate effects of lifetime SHS exposure on asthma in adolescence and later life.

AB  - Rationale: For unclear reasons, obese children with asthma have higher morbidity and reduced response to inhaled corticosteroids.Objectives: To assess whether childhood obesity is associated with airway dysanapsis (an incongruence between the growth of the lungs and the airways) and whether dysanapsis is associated with asthma morbidity.Methods: We examined the relationship between obesity and dysanapsis in six cohorts of children with and without asthma, as well as the relationship between dysanapsis and clinical outcomes in children with asthma. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for each cohort and in a combined analysis of all cohorts; longitudinal analyses were also performed for cohorts with available data. Hazard ratios (HRs) for clinical outcomes were calculated for children with asthma in the Childhood Asthma Management Program.Measurements and Main Results: Being overweight or obese was associated with dysanapsis in both the cross-sectional (OR, 1.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.62-2.35 [for overweight/obese compared with normal weight children]) and the longitudinal (OR, 4.31; 95% CI, 2.99-6.22 [for children who were overweight/obese at all visits compared with normal weight children]) analyses. Dysanapsis was associated with greater lung volumes (FVC, vital capacity, and total lung capacity) and lesser flows (FEV1 and forced expiratory flow, midexpiratory phase), and with indicators of ventilation inhomogeneity and anisotropic lung and airway growth. Among overweight/obese children with asthma, dysanapsis was associated with severe disease exacerbations (HR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.38-2.75) and use of systemic steroids (HR, 3.22; 95% CI, 2.02-5.14).Conclusions: Obesity is associated with airway dysanapsis in children. Dysanapsis is associated with increased morbidity among obese children with asthma and may partly explain their reduced response to inhaled corticosteroids.

AB  - Rationale: A potential adverse effect of high folate intake during pregnancy on children's asthma development remains controversial.Objectives: To prospectively investigate folate intake from both food and supplements during pregnancy and asthma at age 7 years when the diagnosis is more reliable than at preschool age.Methods: This study included eligible children born 2002-2006 from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, a population-based pregnancy cohort, linked to the Norwegian Prescription Database. Current asthma at age 7 was defined by asthma medications dispensed at least twice in the year (1,901 cases; n = 39,846) or by maternal questionnaire report (1,624 cases; n = 28,872). Maternal folate intake was assessed with a food frequency questionnaire validated against plasma folate. We used log-binomial and multinomial regression to calculate adjusted relative risks with 95% confidence intervals.Measurements and Main Results: Risk of asthma was increased in the highest versus lowest quintile of total folate intake with an adjusted relative risk of 1.23 (95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.44) that was similar for maternally reported asthma. Mothers in the highest quintile had a relatively high intake of food folate (median, 308; interquartile range, 241-366 μg/d) and nearly all took at least 400 μg/d of supplemental folic acid (median, 500; interquartile range, 400-600 μg/d).Conclusions: In this large prospective population-based cohort with essentially complete follow-up, pregnant women taking supplemental folic acid at or above the recommended dose, combined with a diet rich in folate, reach a total folate intake level associated with a slightly increased risk of asthma in children.

AB  - Background: Asthma prevalence is generally lower in rural locations with some indication of an urban-rural gradient. However, among children with asthma, certain rural exposures thought to protect against the development of asthma could aggravate the condition. We examined childhood asthma prevalence and related conditions along an urban-rural gradient and also examined the characteristics of those with asthma along the urban-rural gradient.Methods: In 2013 we completed a cross-sectional survey of 3509 children aged 5-14 years living in various population densities of Saskatchewan, Canada. Location of dwelling was identified as belonging to one of the following population densities: large urban region (approximately 200,000), small urban (approximately 35,000), or rural (small town of <1,500 or farm dweller). Physician-diagnosed asthma and asthma-related symptoms were ascertained from responses in the parental-completed questionnaires.Results: Of the study population, 69% lived in a large urban region, 11% lived in a small urban centre and 20% were rural dwellers. Overall, asthma prevalence was 19.6% with differences in asthma prevalence with differences between locations (large urban = 20.7%; small urban = 21.5%; rural = 15.1%; p = 0.003). After adjustment for potential confounders, the association between location of dwelling and asthma remained significant. Despite a lower prevalence of asthma in the rural area, the prevalence and risk of ever wheeze and having more than 3 wheezing episodes in the past 12 months among those who reported asthma, was higher in rural locations after adjustment for potential confounders.Conclusions: The results of this study support the evidence of a difference in childhood asthma prevalence between urban and rural locations and that once a child has asthma, certain rural exposures may aggravate the disease.

AB  - Background: Little is known about the joint effects of maternal asthma and maternal depression on childhood asthma.Objective: To examine whether maternal depression and maternal asthma lead to greater risk of childhood asthma than maternal asthma alone.Methods: Cross-sectional studies of children (6-14 years old) in San Juan, Puerto Rico (n = 655) and Sweden (n = 6,887) were conducted. In Puerto Rico, maternal depressive symptoms were defined using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) questionnaire. In Sweden, maternal physician-diagnosed depression was derived from national registries, and maternal depressive symptoms were defined using an abbreviated CES-D questionnaire. Childhood asthma was defined as physician-diagnosed asthma plus current wheeze (in Puerto Rico) or plus medication use (in Sweden). Logistic regression was used for multivariable analysis.Results: Compared with Puerto Rican children whose mothers had neither asthma nor depressive symptoms, those whose mothers had asthma but no depressive symptoms had 3.2 times increased odds of asthma (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.1-4.8) and those whose mothers had asthma and depressive symptoms had 6.5 times increased odds of asthma (95% CI = 3.3-13.0). Similar results were obtained for maternal depression and maternal asthma in the Swedish cohort (odds ratio for maternal asthma without maternal depression = 2.8, 95% CI = 2.1-3.7; odds ratio for maternal asthma and maternal depression = 4.0, 95% CI = 1.7-9.6). Although the estimated effect of maternal asthma on childhood asthma was increased when maternal depressive symptoms (Puerto Rico) or maternal depression (Sweden) was present, there were no statistically significant additive interactions.Conclusion: Maternal depression can further increase the risk of asthma in children whose mothers have a history of asthma.

AB  - Background: Given the rising incidence of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) globally, especially bronchial asthma, there is the need to reduce the associated morbidity and mortality by adopting an objective means of diagnosis and monitoring. Aim: This article aims to review the trends and challenges in the use of spirometry for managing childhood bronchial asthma especially in developing countries. Methods: We conducted a literature search of published data on the use of spirometry for the diagnosis of childhood bronchial asthma with special emphasis resource-poor countries. Results: Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of childhood asthma recommend the use of spirometry, but this is currently underused in both tertiary and primary care settings especially in developing countries. Lack of spirometers and proper training in their use and interpretation of findings as well as a dearth of asthma guidelines remains core to the underuse of spirometry in managing children with asthma. Targeting education of health care staff was, however, observed to improve its utility, and practical implementable strategies are highlighted. Conclusions: Spirometry is not frequently used for asthma diagnosis in pediatric practice especially in resource-poor countries where the NCD burden is higher. Strategies to overcome the obstacles are implementable and can make a difference in reducing the burden of NCD.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: Diagnosis of asthma in childhood is challenging. Both underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis of asthma are important issues. The present review gives information about challenging factors for an accurate diagnosis of childhood asthma.Recent Findings: Although underdiagnosis of asthma in childhood has always been the most important diagnostic problem, overdiagnosis of asthma has also been increasingly recognized. This is probably due to diagnosis of asthma based on symptoms and signs alone. Demonstration of variable airflow obstruction by lung function tests is the most common asthma diagnostic tests used in practice and is therefore strongly recommended in children who can cooperate. Recently, an asthma guideline combining the clinical and economic evidences with sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic procedures was developed to improve accuracy of diagnosis and to avoid overdiagnosis. This guideline provided an algorithmic clinical and cost-effective approach and included fractional exhaled nitric oxide measurement as one of the diagnostic tests in addition to lung function.Summary: Diagnosis of asthma in children should be made by combining relevant history with at least two confirmatory diagnostic tests whenever possible. Diagnosis based on short-period treatment trials should be limited to young children who are unable to cooperate with these tests.

AB  - Background: Although mercury exposure has been associated with several adverse health effects, the association with childhood asthma is under investigated. Therefore, we explore the association between mercury and childhood asthma in a population with low mercury levels.Methods: Mercury levels were measured in blood and urine in 1,056 children ages 5-14 years. In addition to including questions about asthma diagnosis and wheezing, the study measured bronchial hyperresponsiveness and allergic sensitization to common aeroallergens. Logistic regression analysis adjusted for major potential confounders.Results: Overall the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) between log blood mercury and the outcomes were 0.8 (95% CI: 0.63, 1.11) for asthma, 0.9 (95% CI: 0.79, 1.14) for wheeze, 1.1 (95% CI: 0.60, 2.03) for bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and 1.0 (95% CI: 0.80, 1.17) for allergic sensitization. Urine mercury adjusted for creatinine was also not associated with any of these allergy-related outcomes.Conclusions: While the results did not support an association between mercury exposure and asthma, studies are needed to assess prenatal and lifetime exposure to mercury and asthma.

AB  - Background: Asthma in childhood is a major public health issue. Objective: To estimate prevalence and associated housing environment factors of asthma among school children. Material & Methods: We conducted a cross sectional study among school children aged six to fifteen years. Standard ISAAC (International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Children) Core Questionnaire for Asthma was used for determining the prevalence of wheezing and asthma. Demographic, housing and indoor pollution factors were collected. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 15. Results: Prevalence of 'wheeze ever' and 'current wheezers' was 10% and 9% respectively. Physician diagnosed asthma was seen in 6.3 %. Severe asthma was noted in 28.6% of current wheezers' with 84.6% and 8.8% having one to two and four to 12 wheezing attacks per year respectively. Wheezing was present post exercise in 5.4%, nocturnal cough in 6.1%, sleep disturbance less than one night/week (40.7%), one or more nights/week (3.3%) and wheezing limiting speech to few words between breaths (20.9%). Prevalence was greater among boys (9.8%) than girls (7.5%) and maximal in age group eight to nine years. On multiple logistic regression presence of overcrowding and absence of smoke outlet were significantly associated with current wheeze. Socio-economic status, beedi rolling practices and absence of separate kitchen was statistically significant with severe asthma. Conclusions: Current wheezer prevalence was9% and more in boys. Adoption of improved housing conditions and avoiding environmental tobacco exposure may aid in reducing childhood asthma attacks in this developing city.

AB  - Significant disparities in childhood asthma rates exist across racial and socioeconomic backgrounds. Evidence links in utero exposure to maternal psychological stress with childhood wheezing and asthma, but mechanisms for this association remain poorly elucidated. Furthermore, pregnant women facing high adversity are often missing from clinical trials limiting available data to examine potential relationships between maternal stress and childhood respiratory health. We report results from secondary analyses of data from the Vitamin C to Decrease Effects of Smoking in Pregnancy on Infant Lung Function (VCSIP) study. VCSIP is a randomized double-blind controlled trial of vitamin C supplementation (500mg/daily) during pregnancy to decrease some of the harmful effects of tobacco smoke on offspring pulmonary function, measured at 3 months of life. First, we describe associations between prenatal maternal hair cortisol concentration (HCC) and any report of childhood wheeze through 12 months of age among 158 women facing high adversity and who smoke cigarettes. Hairs from a subset of 33 nonsmokers were available to examine the effect of smoking on HCC. Second, we report VCSIP study procedures, descriptive statistics of recruitment and retention, and provide a 4-Step plan to recruitment and retention of pregnant women from marginalized populations into randomized clinical trials.

AB  - Background: While there is evidence of an association between caesarean birth and increased asthma in children in high-income countries, it is unknown whether this association exists in low-to-middle-income countries (LMICs). We investigated whether children born through caesarean in India and Vietnam are at increased risk of caregiver-reported asthma by 8 years of age.Methods: Data from an ongoing multi-national longitudinal cohort study (the Young Lives Study) in two LMICs (India n = 2026; Vietnam n = 2000) were used. Caregiver questionnaires captured information on caregiver-reported long-term respiratory problems such as asthma or wheeze at age 8 years, birth mode and a range of sociodemographic factors. Multivariable logistic regression models using propensity score adjustment were used to explore birth mode and asthma at age 8 years adjusted for a range of known confounders.Results: Children delivered by caesarean in India (odds ratio (OR) 2.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3, 5.4) and Vietnam (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2, 3.3) had greater odds of asthma at age 8 years, after adjustment for other risk factors including wealth, liveborn parity, low birthweight, geographic location, cooking fuel used, livestock ownership, household size, housing quality and parental smoking.Conclusions: The study suggests that caesarean birth may be associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma in India and Vietnam. The underlying mechanisms of this finding need to be further elucidated.

AB  - Air pollution exposure has increased extensively in recent years and there is considerable evidence that exposure to particulate matter can lead to adverse respiratory outcomes. The health impacts of exposure to air pollution during the prenatal period is especially concerning as it can impair organogenesis and organ development, which can lead to long-term complications. Exposure to air pollution during pregnancy affects respiratory health in different ways. Lung development might be impaired by air pollution indirectly by causing lower birth weight, premature birth or disturbed development of the immune system. Exposure to air pollution during pregnancy has also been linked to decreased lung function in infancy and childhood, increased respiratory symptoms, and the development of childhood asthma. In addition, impaired lung development contributes to infant mortality. The mechanisms of how prenatal air pollution affects the lungs are not fully understood, but likely involve interplay of environmental and epigenetic effects. The current epidemiological evidence on the effect of air pollution during pregnancy on lung function and children's respiratory health is summarized in this review. While evidence for the adverse effects of prenatal air pollution on lung development and health continue to mount, rigorous actions must be taken to reduce air pollution exposure and thus long-term respiratory morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Beta2-adrenoreceptor agonists (β2-agonists) are extensively used in the treatment of childhood asthma. However, there have been concerns regarding their adverse effects and safety. In 2005, the FDA commissioned a "Black Box Warning" communicating the potential for an increased risk for serious asthma exacerbations or asthma related deaths, with the regular use of LABAs. In a meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials, the incidence of severe adverse events appeared to be highest in the 4-11 year age group. Several mechanisms have been proposed regarding the risk of regular use of β2-agonists, such as masking patients' perception of worsening asthma, desensitization and downregulation of the β2-adrenoreceptor, pro-inflammatory effects of β2-agonists, pharmacogenetic effects of β2-adrenoreceptor polymorphisms and age related differences in pathophysiology of asthma. In this paper, we review β2-receptor pharmacology, discuss the concerns regarding treatment with β2-agonists in childhood asthma, and provide suggestions for clinical pediatric practice in the light of current literature.

AB  - Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a soluble pattern recognition receptor and an acute-phase protein. It has gained attention as a new biomarker reflecting tissue inflammation and damage in a variety of diseases. Aim of this study is to investigate the role of PTX3 in childhood asthma.In total, 260 children (140 patients with asthma and 120 controls) were enrolled. PTX3 levels were measured in sputum supernatants using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test. We performed spirometry and methacholine challenge tests and measured the total eosinophil count and the serum levels of total IgE and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) in all subjects.Sputum PTX3 concentration was significantly higher in children with asthma than in control subjects (P < 0.001). Furthermore, sputum PTX3 levels correlated with atopic status and disease severity among patients with asthma. A positive significant correlation was found between sputum PTX3 and the bronchodilator response (r = 0.25, P = 0.013). Sputum PTX3 levels were negatively correlated with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) (r = -0.30, P = 0.001), FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) (r = -0.27, P = 0.002), and FEF25-75 (r = -0.392, P < 0.001), which are indicators of airway obstruction and inflammation. In addition, the PTX3 concentration in sputum showed negative correlations with post-bronchodilator (BD) FEV1 (r = -0.25, P < 0.001) and post-BD FEV1/FVC (r = -0.25, P < 0.001), which are parameters of persistent airflow limitation reflecting airway remodeling.Sputum PTX3 levels increased in children with asthma, suggesting that PTX3 in sputum could be a candidate molecule to evaluate airway inflammation and remodeling in childhood asthma.

AB  - Background: Despite obtaining evidences on association between vitamin D and development of lung in fetus, little is known about vitamin D level and its impact on severity of asthma in children. The present study aimed to assess the relationship between the asthma severity and vitamin D deficiency in asthmatic children. Methods: This case-control study was conducted on 106 individuals including asthmatic (n = 53) and healthy children (n = 53) who referred to Mofid hospital in Tehran in 2013. The level of serum vitamin D in both groups was measured by radioimmunoassay method at the reference lab and was categorized as sufficient (> 30 ng/ml), insufficient (20 to 30 ng/ml), or deficient (< 20 ng/ml). The control status of asthma in patients group was classified as controlled, partially controlled, and uncontrolled. Results: In the groups with and without asthma, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 73.6 and 49.1%, and the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency was 18.9 and 18.9%, while normal vitamin D level was revealed in 7.5 and 32.1%, respectively with a significant difference (p = 0.005). Using the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the presence of asthma was associated with reduced level of vitamin D (OR= 1.068, 95% CI: 1.027-1.110, P = 0.001). In this context, the risk for asthma in the children with vitamin D deficiency was 6.3 times of those with normal vitamin D level. Although the presence of asthma was strongly associated with reduced level of vitamin D in serum, neither severity of asthma nor control status of asthma were associated with vitamin D deficiency. Conclusion: The presence of vitamin D deficiency effectively predict increased risk for childhood asthma; however the severity or control status of this event may not be predicted by confirming vitamin D deficiency.

AB  - Rationale: Little is known about the long-term effects of air pollution exposure and the root causes of asthma. We use exposure to intense air pollution from the 1952 Great Smog of London as a natural experiment to examine both issues.Objectives: To determine whether exposure to extreme air pollution in utero or soon after birth affects asthma development later in life.Methods: This was a natural experiment using the unanticipated pollution event by comparing the prevalence of asthma between those exposed to the Great Smog in utero or the first year of life with those conceived well before or after the incident and those residing outside the affected area at the time of the smog.Measurements and Main Results: Prevalence of asthma during childhood (ages 0-15) and adulthood (ages >15) is analyzed for 2,916 respondents to the Life History portion of the English Longitudinal Study on Aging born from 1945 to 1955. Exposure to the Great Smog in the first year of life increases the likelihood of childhood asthma by 19.87 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.37-36.38). We also find suggestive evidence that early-life exposure led to a 9.53 percentage point increase (95% CI, -4.85 to 23.91) in the likelihood of adult asthma and exposure in utero led to a 7.91 percentage point increase (95% CI, -2.39 to 18.20) in the likelihood of childhood asthma.Conclusions: These results are the first to link early-life pollution exposure to later development of asthma using a natural experiment, suggesting the legacy of the Great Smog is ongoing.

AB  - The onset of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can arise either from failure to attain the normal spirometric plateau or from an accelerated decline in lung function. Despite reports from numerous big cohorts, no single adult life factor, including smoking, accounts for this accelerated decline. By contrast, five childhood risk factors (maternal and paternal asthma, maternal smoking, childhood asthma and respiratory infections) are strongly associated with an accelerated rate of lung function decline and COPD. Among adverse effects on lung development are transgenerational (grandmaternal smoking), antenatal (exposure to tobacco and pollution), and early childhood (exposure to tobacco and pollution including pesticides) factors. Antenatal adverse events can operate by causing structural changes in the developing lung, causing low birth weight and prematurity and altered immunological responses. Also important are mode of delivery, early microbiological exposures, and multiple early atopic sensitizations. Early bronchial hyperresponsiveness, before any evidence of airway inflammation, is associated with adverse respiratory outcomes. Overlapping cohort studies established that spirometry tracks from the preschool years to late middle age, and those with COPD in the sixth decade already had the worst spirometry at age 10 years. Alveolar development is now believed to continue throughout somatic growth and is adversely impacted by early tobacco smoke exposure. Genetic factors are also important, with genes important in lung development and early wheezing also being implicated in COPD. The inescapable conclusion is that the roots of COPD are in early life, and COPD is a disease of childhood adverse factors interacting with genetic factors.

AB  - Childhood asthma is the most common chronic inflammatory childhood disease with almost 20% children and adolescents reporting asthma symptoms in South Africa. Associations between asthma and dietary antioxidants (vitamin E, vitamin C, carotenoids, selenium, polyphenols, and fruit), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and vitamin D have been found. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet seems protective. This condensed review briefly reports on available data of possible protective dietary patters and practices.

AB  - Objective: The prevalence rates of asthma and vitamin D deficiency have been increasing in parallel, leading to significant morbidity. This study aimed to compare the vitamin D levels in the children with asthma and in healthy controls and to assess the relationship between vitamin D levels and asthma clinical parameters and control. Materials and Methods: 115 children with asthma and 115 controls who presented to the Pediatric Immunology and Allergy outpatient clinic between December 2014 and February 2015 were enrolled in the study. Vitamin D levels were measured. Levels ≥ 20 ng/ml were considered adequate and those lower than 20 ng/ml as deficient. Asthma control was classified according to the Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines (GINA) and Childhood asthma control test (C-ACT). Results: Serum vitamin D levels were 17.27 (5.77) ng/ml in the asthma group and 22.78 (10.64) ng/ml in the control group, indicating statistical significance (p= 0.001). When the asthma patients were divided into groups according to vitamin D level, 72.2% were deficient while 27.8% had adequate levels. The number of asthma exacerbations, number of emergency service visits and the number of hospitalizations within the last year were higher in the deficient group, compared to the adequate group (p <0.001, p<0.001 and p <0.002, respectively). Uncontrolled asthma rates were higher in the deficient group, compared to the adequate group (p<0.01). Serum vitamin D levels were correlated with the ACT score (r=0.204, p=0.03). Conclusion: The rate of vitamin D deficiency was higher in asthmatic children compared to the controls. We also showed that increased asthma severity and reduced asthma control were associated with vitamin D deficiency. There was a positive correlation between serum vitamin D levels and asthma control.

Çalışmanın amacı, serum D vitamini düzeylerini astımlı çocuklar ile sağlıklı kontroller arasında karşılaştırmak, D vitamini düzeylerinin astım klinik parametreleri ile ilişkisini ve astım kontrolü üzerine etkisini değerlendirmektir. Gereç ve Yöntem: Çalışmaya Çocuk İmmünolojisi ve Allerji polikliniğine Aralık 2014-Şubat 2015 ayları arasında başvuran 115 astımlı çocuk ile 115 sağlıklı kontrol alındı. 25 hidroksivitamin D(25(OH)D) düzeyleri ölçüldü. D vitamini düzeyi ≥20 ng/ml yeterli 20 ng/ml altı eksik olarak değerlendirildi. Astım Kontrolü Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) rehberi ve çocukluk çağı astım kontrol testi (C-ACT) kullanılarak değerlendirildi. Bulgular: Astım grubunda D vitamini düzeyi 17.27 (5.77) ng/ml kontrol grubunda 22.78 (10.64) ng/ml ölçüldü ve fark istatistiksel olarak anlamlı idi (p= 0.001). D vitamini durumuna göre astımlı çocukların %72.2’sinde D vitamini eksik, %27.8’nde D vitamini yeterli idi. D vitamini eksik grupta bir önceki yıl astım alevlenmesi, acil servis başvurusu ve hastaneye yatış sayısı D vitamini yeterli gruptan daha fazla idi (sırası ile p <0.001, p <0.001 ve p <0.002). D vitamini eksik grupta kontrolsüz astım oranı D vitamini yeterli gruba göre daha fazla idi (p < 0.01). D vitamini düzeyi ile ACT puanı arasında pozitif ilişki saptandı. Sonuç: Çalışmanın sonunda D vitamini eksikliğinin astımlı çocuklarda sağlıklı kontrollere göre daha fazla olduğu saptandı. Astım şiddetinde artma ve astım kontrolünde bozulmanın D vitamini eksikliği ile ilişkili olduğu gösterildi. D vitamini düzeyleri ile ACT puanı arasında pozitif ilişki saptandı.

AB  - Background: The objective of this study was to design and test the feasibility and impact of a community health worker (CHW) intervention for comorbid asthma and obesity.Methods: Using a proof of concept study design, we collected pre/post outcomes from a single intervention cohort of urban low-income in a single community area. A community-based participatory research approach was employed. Forty-six children and their caregivers were recruited. Children were 5-12 years old with physician-diagnosed asthma and body mass index (BMI) > 85%. Families were offered 12 home visits from CHWs that integrated asthma and obesity core curriculums. The primary asthma outcome was asthma control, measured via the Childhood Asthma Control Test (cACT). The primary obesity outcome was child body mass index (BMI).Results: Families received a median of 10 out of the 12 home visits over 1 year. At 1 year, there was a significant improvement in the number of children with controlled asthma as measured via cACT (85.7% at 1 year compared to 61.9% at baseline, p = 0.01). Activity limitations and emergency utilization were reduced while inhaler technique improved (p < 0.01 for all). Child BMI z-score was reduced: mean = 1.97 (SD 0.79) at 1 year compared to mean = 2.13 (SD 0.40) at baseline, p < 0.01. No association was seen between change in child BMI and change in asthma control. Worse baseline child depression scores were associated with less improvement in asthma control (p = 0.003) and higher baseline caregiver post-traumatic stress disorder scores were associated with increased child BMI (p = 0.012).Conclusions: The CHW intervention has promise for improving asthma and weight outcomes in high-risk children with comorbid asthma and obesity; this model warrants further development and investigation.

AB  - Objectives: Traditional Chinese medicine are commonly used for treatment of asthma. However, there are only very limited data about its efficacy in children. Therefore, we aimed to determine the efficacy of augmented Yu Ping Feng San (aYPFS) as an add-on to oral montelukast compared with montelukast alone for treatment of mild persistent asthma in children.Design: A single centre, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized control trial was carried out. Participants with age 6-18 years who had mild persistent asthma were randomized according to random number list to receive either aYPFS plus montelukast for 24 weeks or placebo plus montelukast for 24 weeks. Primary outcome measure was lung function parameters. Secondary outcome measures were Asthma Control Test™ (ACT™) and Paediatric Allergic Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PADQLQ) scores, symptom-free days, short-acting β2-agonist use, use of rescue oral corticosteroids, days of hospitalization for asthma and number of emergency consultation with GPs or AED department.Results: Twenty-eight participants were randomized to aYPFS group and twenty-nine to placebo group. There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics. There was significant improvement in ACT™ score in aYPFS group (up to 6.9% change from baseline) (p=0.016) but not in the control group. There were no significant differences between groups in other primary and secondary outcome parameters. Dropout because of adverse effects is comparable in both groups.Conclusion: Traditional Chinese medicine aYPFS as an add-on to montelukast improved symptoms of asthma control. Further studies with larger sample size are needed to evaluate its efficacy and safety in childhood asthma.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: The goal of this review was to systematically analyze recent studies updating our knowledge on the role of epigenetic mechanisms in childhood asthma.Recent Findings: A systematic literature search was conducted that identified 23 fresh articles published within the last 5 years reporting the results of human studies on the relationships between epigenetic modifications and childhood asthma or its/related phenotypes. In almost all these studies, meaningful associations between levels of epigenetic marks (DNA methylation and/or histone modifications) and pediatric asthma or its/related phenotypes have been observed. In addition, many studies identified by our screening analyzed those associations in the context of environmental factors, such as pollution, tobacco smoke, farming, or diet, showing in a huge majority a modifying effect of those exposures.Summary: The results of our systematic literature search provide a strong support for the role of epigenetic mechanisms in (mediating the effects of environmental exposure on) pediatric asthma. This knowledge may possibly be translated into diagnostic and/or therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: The aim of the present review is to discuss updates on research regarding the relationship between indoor allergen exposure and childhood asthma with a focus on clinical effects, locations of exposure, and novel treatments.Recent Findings: Recent data continue to demonstrate that early life sensitization to indoor allergens is a predictor of asthma development later in life. Furthermore, avoidance of exposure to these allergens continues to be important especially given that the vast majority of children with asthma are sensitized to at least one indoor allergen. New research suggests that mouse allergen, more so than cockroach allergen, may be the most relevant urban allergen. Recent evidence reminds us that children are exposed to clinically important levels of indoor allergens in locations away from their home, such as schools and daycare centers. Exposure to increased levels of indoor mold in childhood has been associated with asthma development and exacerbation of current asthma; however, emerging evidence suggests that early exposure to higher fungal diversity may actually be protective for asthma development. Novel treatments have been developed that target TH2 pathways thus decreasing asthmatic responses to allergens. These therapies show promise for the treatment of severe allergic asthma refractory to avoidance strategies and standard therapies.Summary: Understanding the relationship between indoor allergens and asthma outcomes is a constantly evolving study of timing, location, and amount of exposure.

AB  - SUMMARY: Over the past two decades, diverse stakeholder groups, representing various disciplines and perspectives (e.g., federal, state and local policy makers; nonprofit organizations; health professionals; and industry), have devoted considerable resources, expertise, and influence toward efforts that wittingly and unwittingly affect children's environmental health. In this article, we refer to these groups as "homes of influence," and we summarize the wide reach and potential impacts of these homes on childhood asthma, as one example that illustrates how these varied groups impact childhood health outcomes. We posit that diverse homes of influence can be most successful in effecting positive change when they understand and acknowledge their respective influences and work together to develop informed, preventive initiatives under the framework of recommendations called, "A Blueprint for Protecting Children's Environmental Health: An Urgent Call to Action." This published resource was developed by a panel of thought leaders and experts in the field of children's environmental health to guide cross-sector collaboration efforts to proactively protect the environmental health of all children.

AB  - Question In children with asthma, does adding salmeterol to fluticasone affect risks for serious asthma events or exacerbations? Methods Design Randomized controlled trial (RCT) (VESTRI). ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01462344. Allocation {Concealed}*. Blinding Blinded (patients, clinicians, investigators, outcome adjudicators, safety committee, {data collectors, and data analysts}*). Patients and investigators were not blinded to fluticasone dose. Follow-up period 6 months after the first study drug dose or 7 days after the last dose, whichever was longer (approximately 26 wk). Setting 567 clinical centers in 32 countries. Patients 6250 children 4 to 11 years of age (mean age 7.6 y, 61% boys) who had been consistently using asthma medication in the past 4 weeks, had exacerbations in the past 12 months but not the past 30 days, and had been assessed with the Childhood Asthma Control Test. Exclusion criteria included life-threatening or unstable asthma. Intervention Fluticasone-salmeterol (n = 3107) or fluticasone alone (n = 3101) twice daily via a DISKUS device. Fluticasone propionate was delivered at doses of 100 µg or 250 µg. Salmeterol dose was 50 µg. Outcomes Serious asthma events (asthma-related deaths, intubations, or hospitalizations). Secondary outcomes included asthma exacerbations that required systemic glucocorticoids for ࣙ 3 days or a depot injection of glucocorticoids. 6202 patients were needed to determine noninferiority of fluticasone-salmeterol vs fluticasone alone for serious asthma events based on an estimated fluticasone-alone event rate of 0.7% over 26 weeks (noninferiority margin for treatment hazard ratio was 2.675, 90% power, 1-sided α = 0.025). Patient follow-up 99% (intention-to-treat analysis). Main results Groups did not differ for serious asthma events or exacerbations (Table). Conclusion In children with asthma, adding salmeterol to fluticasone did not increase risk for serious asthma events or reduce exacerbations.

AB  - Background: There is increasing evidence that neighborhood-level factors, in addition to individual-level factors, may contribute directly or indirectly to childhood asthma by affecting environmental and lifestyle factors. Exposure to neighborhood crime and violence has been associated with poor health outcomes, especially among underserved and minority populations, and its effect on respiratory health is an area of active research.Objective: To examine the association of residential neighborhood crime with asthma and asthma-related outcomes among Mexican American children.Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted with parents of 2,023 Mexican American children. We derived measures of neighborhood (census tract) violent, property, and drug abuse crime and used multilevel generalized estimating equations to test associations of neighborhood crime counts with respiratory conditions.Results: In multiple regression models, a 1-SD increase in neighborhood property crimes significantly increased the odds of lifetime asthma, lifetime wheezing, lifetime emergency department (ED) visits attributable to asthma or wheezing, and lifetime hospitalization attributable to asthma or wheezing by 25%, 18%, 44%, and 62%, respectively. A 1-SD elevation in neighborhood violent crime was positively and significantly associated with 21% and 57% higher odds of lifetime wheezing and ED visits, respectively. We also observed 13% and 44% significantly increased odds of lifetime wheezing and ED visits, respectively, for a 1-SD increase in drug abuse crime. These findings were not explained or modified by individual- and neighborhood-level covariates.Conclusion: Higher neighborhood crime was associated with greater odds of asthma and asthma morbidity in Mexican American children.

AB  - Objective: Identify profiles of functioning in families of children with asthma and examine whether profile membership predicts subsequent child mental and physical well-being.Methods: Primary caregivers and children ( N  = 1,030) from the Childhood Asthma Management Program completed questionnaires assessing family functioning and child adaptation at five time points. Asthma severity was also assessed via spirometry.Results: Latent profile analyses identified a four-profile solution as best fitting the data: cohesive, permissive, controlling/disengaged, and controlling/enmeshed families. Distal outcome analyses using Bolck-Croon-Hagenaars techniques suggested that children from families that were more cohesive had fewer internalizing and externalizing symptoms. These associations remained stable across time. Family profiles did not differ with regards to child asthma severity.Conclusion: Results highlight the importance of looking beyond the effects of distinct components of family functioning and instead using pattern-based approaches. Recommendations for incorporating screenings and services for families in pediatric care settings are provided.

AB  - Objectives: The objective of this study was to investigate 2 key dimensions of socioeconomic status (SES)-prestige and resources-and their associations with immune, behavioral, and clinical outcomes in childhood asthma.Methods: Children ages 9 to 17 years with a physician's diagnosis of asthma (N = 150), and one of their parents participated in this study. Children and parents completed interviews and questionnaires about SES (prestige = parent education; resources = family assets), environmental exposures, and clinical asthma measures. Spirometry was conducted to assess children's pulmonary function, and blood was collected to measure cytokine production in response to nonspecific stimulation, allergen-specific stimulation, and microbial stimulation.Results: Higher scores on both dimensions of childhood SES were associated with better clinical outcomes in children (β's from |.18 to .27|, p values < .05). Higher prestige, but not resources, was associated with better home environment control behaviors and less exposure to smoke (β's from |.21 to .22|, p values < .05). Higher resources, but not prestige, was associated with more favorable immune regulation, as manifest in smaller peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) TH1 and TH2 cytokine responses (β's from -.18 to -.19; p values < .05), and smaller proinflammatory cytokine responses (β = -.19; p < .05) after ex vivo stimulation. Higher resources also were associated with more sensitivity to glucocorticoid inhibition of TH1 and TH2 cytokine production (β's from -.18 to -.22; p values < .05).Conclusions: These results suggest that prestige and resources in childhood family environments have different implications for behavioral and immunological processes relevant to childhood asthma. They also suggest that childhood SES relates to multiple aspects of immunologic regulation of relevance to the pathophysiology of asthma.

AB  - Introduction. Parental perceptions and practices are important for improving the asthma outcomes in children; indeed, evidence shows that parents of asthmatic children harbor considerable misperceptions of the disease. Objective. To investigate the perceptions and practices of parents toward asthma and its management in Saudi children. Methods. Using a self-administered questionnaire, a two-stage cross-sectional survey of parents of children aged between 3 and 15 years, was conducted from schools located in Riyadh province in central Saudi Arabia. Results. During the study interval, 2000 parents were asked to participate in the study; 1450 parents responded, of whom 600 (41.4%) reported that their children had asthma, dyspnea, or chest allergy (recurrent wheezing or coughing), while 478 (32.9%) of the parents reported that their children were diagnosed earlier with asthma by a physician. Therefore, the final statistical analyses were performed with 600 participants. Furthermore, 321 (53.5%) respondents believed that asthma is solely a hereditary disease. Interestingly, 361 (60.3%) were concerned about side effects of inhaled corticosteroids and 192 (32%) about the development of dependency on asthma medications. Almost 76% of parents had previously visited a pediatric emergency department during an asthma attack. Conclusions. Parents had misperceptions regarding asthma and exhibited ineffective practices in its management. Therefore, improving asthma care and compliance requires added parental education.

AB  - The prevalence of asthma in the United States is steadily increasing, affecting African-Americans and Latino groups more significantly. We conducted a literature review to established health disparities and factors that trigger asthma in African-American children in low-income communities in Fort Valley, GA. Review of the literature shows that triggering factors contributing to the high prevalence, severity and poorer health outcomes of childhood asthma in African-American communities include a variety of socioeconomic factors, such as poverty, low literacy, health behaviors, lack of access to health care and access to health insurance, housing structures, and environmental exposures. We propose that, in order to break the cycle of health disparities and factors that trigger asthma, a partnership involving community leaders, medical, environmental, and public health professionals creates a forum to promote asthma awareness in order to empower members of the community to address the factors adversely impacting their health. Mobilizing a diverse group of stakeholders and focusing on health and education policy and system which addresses disparities in both health and education should be a top priority in low-income communities. The recruiting of culturally diverse and culturally competent health professionals and practice leadership should be a common goal. Strategies within the control of the community can be taught to improve safety and promote better health practices. Additional activities towards improving education and reducing health disparities could include raising funds and support to renovate housing units which are in a dilapidated state, and to provide more community based health literacy training.

AB  - Although asthma is the most common non-communicable disease of childhood, there is no standardised definition nor gold-standard test available to diagnose the condition. Asthma is a complex airways disorder where genetic, environmental and host immunity are likely to play a part. Misdiagnosis in children is common, although objective lung function tests aid accuracy, when combined with a clinical history. Adopting a stepwise approach to achieving complete, or good, control of symptoms enhances management and regular treatment reviews should include provision of mutually-agreed, written personalised asthma action plans, which should also be given to children's schools. When control is poor or diagnosis uncertain, patients should be referred to specialist care.

AB  - Background: At Georgia State University, the Health Law Partnership (HeLP) Legal Services Clinic is part of the Health Law Partnership, which is a medical-legal collaboration among Georgia State Law, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA), Emory University School of Medicine, Morehouse School of Medicine and the Atlanta Legal Aid Society. HeLP clinic law students learn alongside residents and medical students. Law students work on cases involving childhood asthma, housing conditions, education, and access to healthcare. Clients are low income residents of the metro Atlanta area, whose children are receiving care at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. Methods: following IRB approval, the collaboration of law students, medical students and residents serving in the HeLP clinic, a short two-part survey was distributed to assess the knowledge and understanding of the National Asthma Education Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines. Two sections: 1. the knowledge level of law students, medical students and residents serving in the HeLP clinic for effective asthma management; and 2. the use of an AE-C as credentialed by the NAECB. Data obtained was analyzed using SPSS, version 23. Descriptive analysis (frequency tables), and t-tests of significance were utilized. Results: 34 HeLP clinic members, 44% medical residents and 32% law students completed the survey. 64% of the HeLP clinic members have 1 year or less than 1 year of experience serving in the clinic. Current data suggests that 85% of HeLP clinic members, law students and medical residents alike, would utilize the resources of an AE-C if available within the clinic. Our results revealed no significant difference of the knowledge of asthma management between law students and medical residents. Medical resident responses to the NAEPP guidelines were higher than the law students. When reviewing individual answers of the asthma self-management guidelines, law students answered more correctly than medical residents. Discussion: this study was to determine the knowledge of asthma and the use of AE-C's within the HeLP clinic amongst law and medical students, and residents. No known studies have compared the knowledge of asthma and use of an AE-C. Further education and needs-awareness is needed for physicians and those who advocate for individuals with this incurable, yet, manageable pulmonary disease. The utilization as well as awareness of AE-Cs is also strongly suggested.

AB  - Background: Childhood asthma prevalence has stopped increasing, but rates for children living in poverty remain high. The NHLBI EPR-3 guidelines recommend classifying asthma severity and control to guide asthma management. This study evaluated the agreement between the healthcare providers' classification and clinical data for asthma severity and control in a predominantly minority population. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted in a random sample of 600 children enrolled in an urban medical home network. Children were less than 18 years old, diagnosed with asthma, and had a routine healthcare encounter between March 2013 and March 2014. This study was approved by the medical center's institutional review board. The asthma severity and control classifications by medical providers were extracted from the electronic health record. Two researchers independently assigned EPR-3 severity and control classifications based upon the clinical data in the child's chart and resolved differences when they occurred. Descriptive statistics were computed for demographic information. The agreement between the healthcare providers' and researchers' asthma classification for severity and control was assessed using the two-way random effects interclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: The sample of 266 children who met eligibility criteria were 38.6% male; 72.2% African American, 20.7% Hispanic or Latino, 5.6% White, and 1.5% other; with a mean age of 9.8 ± 4.3 y. Across all routine visits (« = 286), medical providers' rate of documentation was 74.5% for asthma severity, and 58% for asthma control. The proportion of agreement between medical providers and clinical data for asthma severity was 67% (ICC = .733, 95% CI = .639 -.802) and asthma control was 85% (ICC = .824, 95% CI = .759 -.871). Conclusions: The assessment of asthma control by medical providers lags behinds their assessment of asthma severity in this sample of children from predominantly minority backgrounds. There was strong agreement between medical providers' and researchers' assessment of clinical data for asthma severity and control. Identifying effective strategies to increase the frequency and accuracy of asthma severity and control classifications may improve asthma management in this vulnerable population. 1.

AB  - Background: Asthma is a global problem. Prevalence varies among different countries and cities. We aimed to obtain the prevalence, describe the characteristics, and discover factors that may relate to asthma in Hangzhou.Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Hangzhou. The subjects were children aged 14 years and younger. A control group of non-asthma children that matched in age and sex with each asthmatic patient was also randomly selected and interviewed. International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood and National Epidemiology study of Asthma and Allergies in China questionnaires were used in this survey.Results: We have questionnaired 13,877 children, and 665 (4.8 %) children were diagnosed asthma. The guardians regarded the cost of asthma management affordable in 49.4 %, tolerable in 46.9 %, and intolerable in 3.7 %. Both guardians and children have been absent from work or school due to children's asthma. Respiratory tract infection was the most common trigger of asthma attacks (85.1 %). Other common causes included cold air, house dust, exercise, fish and shrimp, pollen, and et al. Interestingly, we also found in children 6 years and older, some triggers happened more than that in children 5 years and younger. Those factors included exercise, emotional changes, house dust, pollen, renovation works in the home, mosquito-repellent incense and pets (all the p values were <0.05). We compared some factors may relate to asthma development. Higher percentage of family history of asthma, personal history of allergy (atopic dermatitis, drug allergy and food allergy), comorbidities (allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, adenoidal hypertrophy, and urticaria), caesarean birth and complications ever happened during pregnancy were discovered in asthma children than in non-asthma children (all the p values were <0.05). Exclusive breastfeeding within first 6 months and keeping animals had higher percentage in non-asthma children than in asthma (both the p values were <0.05). Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/ICS + long-acting beta2 agonists (LABA) was applied to 46.2 % of patients. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) was used in 44.2 % of asthma children, while leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) was used in 36.4 % of them. The adherence scored higher in TCM than in ICS/ICS + LABA (P = 0.003) and LTRA.Conclusions: In conclusion, we conducted an epidemiology study in Hangzhou. The prevalence of childhood asthma was 4.8 %. Asthma was an economic and social burden to both children and guardians. Risk factors of asthma development may include caesarean birth, personal history of allergy and concomitant allergic diseases. Exclusive breastfeeding within first 6 months and keeping animals might be protecting factors. TCM was really popular in China besides ICS/ICS + LABA and LTRA.

AB  - Background: Access to asthma specialists is a problem, particularly in rural areas, thus presenting an opportunity for management using telemedicine.Objective: To compare asthma outcomes during 6 months in children managed by telemedicine vs in-person visits.Methods: Children with asthma residing in 2 remote locations were offered the choice of an in-person visit or a telemedicine session at a local clinic. The telemedicine process involved real-time use of a Remote Presence Solution (RPS) equipped with a digital stethoscope, otoscope, and high-resolution camera. A telefacilitator operated the RPS and performed diagnostic and educational procedures, such as spirometry and asthma education. Children in both groups were assessed initially, after 30 days, and at 6 months. Asthma outcome measures included asthma control using validated tools (Asthma Control Test, Childhood Asthma Control Test, and Test for Respiratory and Asthma Control in Kids) and patient satisfaction (telemedicine group only). Noninferiority analysis of asthma control was performed using the minimally important difference of an adjusted asthma control test that combined the 3 age groups.Results: Of 169 children, 100 were seen in-person and 69 via telemedicine. A total of 34 in-person and 40 telemedicine patients completed all 3 visits. All had a small, although statistically insignificant, improvement in asthma control over time. Telemedicine was noninferior to in-person visits. Most of the telemedicine group subjects were satisfied with their experience.Conclusion: Children with asthma seen by telemedicine or in-person visits can achieve comparable degrees of asthma control. Telemedicine can be a viable alternative to traditional in-person physician-based care for the treatment and management of asthma.

AB  - Objective: The prevalence of asthma is increased in obese individuals. There is no concrete evidence that an increase in body mass index is associated with a loss of pulmonary function in childhood asthma. Our aim was to investigate the effect of obesity, atopy, and sex on pulmonary function in asthmatic children. Materials and Methods: This study is a cross-sectional analysis in children with mild persistent asthma. A total of 76 obese and 55 lean children with asthma were recruited. All of the participants were assessed by pulmonary function tests. Skin prick tests including common aeroallergens were performed to all patients. Results: No differences were found in pulmonary function test parameters between obese and lean patients with asthma. In obese patients with asthma, the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 s to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) was significantly lower in nonatopic (92.1±6.4) than in atopic patients (95.5±5.3, p=0.02). We also demonstrated that FEV1/FVC was significantly lower in nonatopic obese patients (92.1±6.4) than in nonatopic lean patients with asthma (95.6±4.7, p=0.05). Conclusion: Obesity does not seem to be affecting pulmonary function in children with well-controlled mild persistent asthma. However, airways of nonatopic obese asthmatics are negatively affected.
AB  - Giriş: Obez bireylerde astım prevelansı artmıştır. Çocukluk astımında vücut kitle indeksindeki artışın solunum fonksiyonlarını kötüleştirdiğini gösteren kesin kanıt yoktur. Amacımız astımlı çocuklarda obezite, atopi ve cinsiyetin solunum fonksiyonu üzerine etkisini araştırmaktır. Gereç ve Yöntem: Çalışma hafif persistan astımı olan çocuklarda yapılan kesitsel bir analizdir. 76 obez astım ve 55 normal kilodaki astımlı çocuk çalışmaya alındı. Tüm katılımcılar solunum fonksiyon testi ile değerlendirildi. Tüm hastalara sık saptanan aeroallerjenler ile deri prick testi yapıldı. Bulgular: Obez ve normal kilodaki astımlı çocukların solunum fonksiyon test parametreleri arasında fark yoktu. Obez astımlı hastalarda atopik olmayanların (92.1±6.4) birinci saniyedeki zorlu ekspiratuvar volümün zorlu vital kapasiteye oranı (FEV1/FVC) atopik (95.5±5.3, p=0.02) olanlara göre daha düşüktü. Aynı zamanda atopik olmayan obezlerin (92.1±6.4) FEV1/FVC oranının atopik olmayan normal kilodaki astımlı çocuklardan (95.6±4.7) daha düşük olduğu saptandı (p=0.05). Sonuç: Obezitenin iyi kontrollü, hafif persistan astımı olan çocukların solunum fonksiyonunu etkilemediği görülmektedir. Ancak, atopisi olmayan obez astımlı çocukların hava yolları daha fazla etkilenmektedir.

AB  - The author discusses the importance of spirometry in diagnosing asthma. She states that the use of spirometry over peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements is preferable, however, several studies showed that PEF in childhood asthma are unreliable. She notes that proper and continuous training is one important condition that has to be met by general practitioner (GP) and practice nurses to secure the valid use of spirometry.

AB  - Objectives: Asthma is among the most common chronic conditions in childhood. There is growing evidence that diet plays a role in the development of asthma: consumption of anti-inflammatory foods/nutrients (AIF) has been associated with decreased asthma rates while consumption of pro-inflammatory foods (PIF) is associated with increased rates. The objective of this study was to assess the association between food consumption and asthma rates in a population based sample of Prince Edward Island children aged 10-12. Methods: Cross-sectional survey of elementary school children in grades 5 and 6. Children completed an in-class lunchtime food record (LFR) in 2007 (n = 1992), 2010 (n = 1625) and 2012 (n = 1564), recording the food, amount and source overseen by research assistants. Classification into PIF and AIF categories was based on nutrient composition and research evidence. Logistic regression models adjusted for confounders (parental income, education level and child's age) were used to examine the odds of having parent reported asthma associated with daily servings of AIF and PIF. Results: Boys had a greater odds of reported asthma prevalence (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.49-1.97). Given the large effect of gender, separate models were run for boys and girls. In girls, there was a positive association with sugar intake (PIF) (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.06-2.27) and French fries (PIF) (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.01-1.60) and asthma rates, while no effect was seen in boys. No significant associations with AIF were shown for either gender. Implications & Conclusions: While consumption of PIF foods is associated with a modest increase in reported asthma rates in girls, there was no evidence of a protective effect of AIF in either gender. These findings are of importance to public health stakeholders and policy makers, suggesting that limiting PIF may be one way of reducing childhood asthma.

AB  - Background: Aspirin is widely used in general population and low-dose aspirin is commonly prescribed to prevent recurrent pregnancy loss associated with antiphospholipid syndrome and preeclampsia, often used throughout pregnancy. But aspirin is associated with asthma pathogenesis. We aim to examine whether in utero exposure to aspirin at different fetal stages is associated with asthma in childhood.Methods: We used data from the Collaborative Perinatal Project. Maternal exposure to aspirin before and during pregnancy was recorded at each prenatal visit. Children were followed up to 7 years of age. A total of 19,928 singleton children without maternal history of asthma were included. We used multilevel multiple logistic regression models to control for potential confounders.Results: In utero exposure to aspirin was associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma (adjusted odds ratio [aORs] = 1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1, 1.6). aORs for exposure in first, second, and third trimesters were 1.1 (95% CI = 0.87, 1.3), 1.2 (95% CI = 1.0, 1.4), and 1.4 (95% CI = 1.1, 1.6), respectively. Furthermore, aORs of asthma were 1.3 (95% CI = 1.0, 1.7) and 1.3 (95% CI = 1.0, 1.7) for aspirin use for 2 to 7 days or more than 7 days in third trimester, respectively.Conclusion: In utero exposure to therapeutic dose of aspirin even just briefly in late pregnancy is associated with childhood asthma by 7 years of age. More research is needed to carefully examine the association between low-dose aspirin with extended exposure period and long-term child outcomes.

AB  - Rationale: Life-course persistent asthma and tobacco smoking are risk factors for irreversible airflow obstruction. It is often assumed that smoking and asthma have additive or multiplicative effects on the risk for airflow obstruction, but this has not been demonstrated in prospective studies of children with persistent asthma.Objectives: To investigate the effects of smoking and asthma on the development of airflow obstruction in a population-based birth cohort followed to age 38 years.Methods: Reports of childhood asthma from ages 9, 11, and 13 and self-reports of adult asthma at ages 32 and 38 years were used to define childhood-onset persistent asthma (n = 91), late-onset asthma (n = 93), asthma in remission (n = 85), and nonasthmatic (n = 572) phenotypes. Cumulative tobacco smoking histories and spirometry were obtained at ages 18, 21, 26, 32, and 38 years. Analyses were by generalized estimating equations adjusting for childhood spirometry, body mass index, age, and sex.Measurements and Main Results: Smoking history and childhood-onset persistent asthma were both associated with lower FEV1/FVC ratios. Associations between smoking and FEV1/FVC ratios were different between asthma phenotypes (interaction P < 0.001). Smoking was associated with lower prebronchodilator and post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratios among subjects without asthma and those with late-onset or remittent asthma, but smoking was not associated with lower FEV1/FVC ratios among those with childhood-onset persistent asthma.Conclusions: Childhood-onset persistent asthma is associated with airflow obstruction by mid-adult life, but this does not seem to be made worse by tobacco smoking. We found no evidence that smoking and childhood-persistent asthma have additive or multiplicative effects on airflow obstruction.

AB  - Background: Although a number of patients with asthma report experiencing persistent cough during sleep, it has not yet been objectively investigated.Objective: To classify cough severity and evaluate a characteristic pattern of cough frequency in children with asthma using an objective cough monitoring system.Methods: An objective cough monitoring system that specialized in children was used to measure cough frequency and nocturnal cough patterns. Coughs were recorded with microphone and accelerometer and analyzed using a customized software program. The number of nocturnal coughs and the pattern of cough frequency in 30-minute intervals were measured along with the severity of each asthma exacerbation, and the results were compared with children without asthma.Results: The total overnight cough count of 34 children with asthma was higher than that of 15 children without asthma (P < .001). The total overnight cough count in children with severe asthma exacerbation was higher than that in children with moderate asthma exacerbation (P < .05). The cough counts were significantly increased at the time of falling asleep and waking. This pattern was not observed in children without asthma. The total cough counts and cough patterns in children with asthma were not affected by sex, age, cause of asthma exacerbation, or therapy.Conclusion: Our data indicate huge cough counts and characteristic nocturnal cough patterns in children with asthma. Objective and precise cough monitoring is useful for the management of childhood asthma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although it is well established that air pollutants can exacerbate asthma, the link with new asthma onset in children is less clear. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the association between the onset of childhood asthma with both time of birth and time-varying exposures to outdoor air pollutants. METHOD: An open cohort of children born in the province of Québec, Canada, was created using linked medical-administrative databases. New cases of asthma were defined as one hospital discharge with a diagnosis of asthma or two physician claims for asthma within a 2 year period. Annual ozone (O3) levels were estimated at the child's residence for all births 1999-2010, and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels during 1996-2006 were estimated for births on the Montreal Island. Satellite based concentrations of fine particles (PM2.5) were estimated at a 10 km x 10 km resolution and assigned to residential postal codes throughout the province (1996-2011). Hazard ratios (HRs) were assessed with Cox models for the exposure at the birth address and for the time-dependent exposure. We performed an indirect adjustment for secondhand smoke (SHS). RESULTS: We followed 1,183,865 children (7,752,083 person-years), of whom 162,752 became asthmatic. After controlling for sex and material and social deprivation, HRs for an interquartile range increase in exposure at the birth address to NO2 (5.45 ppb), O[sub 3] (3.22 ppb), and PM2.5 (6.50 µg/m³) were 1.04 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.05), 1.11 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.12), and 1.31 (95% CI: 1.28, 1.33), respectively. Effects of O3 and PM[sub 2.5] estimated with time-varying Cox models were similar to those estimated using exposure at birth, whereas the effect of NO2 was slightly stronger (HR = 1.07; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.09). CONCLUSIONS: Asthma onset in children appears to be associated with residential exposure to PM[sub 2.5], O3 and NO2.

AB  - Despite the benefits of smoke-free legislation on adult health, little is known about its impact on children's health. We examined the effects of tobacco control policies on the rate of emergency department (ED) visits for childhood asthma (N=128,807), ear infections (N=288,697), and respiratory infections (N=410,686) using outpatient ED visit data in Massachusetts (2001-2010), New Hampshire (2001-2009), and Vermont (2002-2010). We used negative binomial regression models to analyze the effect of state and local smoke-free legislation on ED visits for each health condition, controlling for cigarette taxes and health care reform legislation. We found no changes in the overall rate of ED visits for asthma, ear infections, and upper respiratory infections after the implementation of state or local smoke-free legislation or cigarette tax increases. However, an interaction with children's age revealed that among 10-17-year-olds state smoke-free legislation was associated with a 12% reduction in ED visits for asthma (adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRR) 0.88; 95% CI 0.83, 0.95), an 8% reduction for ear infections (0.92; 0.88, 0.97), and a 9% reduction for upper respiratory infections (0.91; 0.87, 0.95). We found an overall 8% reduction in ED visits for lower respiratory infections after the implementation of state smoke-free legislation (0.92; 0.87, 0.96). The implementation of health care reform in Massachusetts was also associated with a 6-9% reduction in all children's ED visits for ear and upper respiratory infections. Our results suggest that state smoke-free legislation and health care reform may be effective interventions to improve children's health by reducing ED visits for asthma, ear infections, and respiratory infections.

AB  - Background. Prevalence of childhood asthma varies significantly among regions, while its reasons are not clear yet with only a few studies reporting relevant causes for this variation. Objective. To investigate the potential role of city-average levels of air pollutants and climatic factors in order to distinguish differences in asthma prevalence in China and explain their reasons. Methods. Data pertaining to 10,777 asthmatic patients were obtained from the third nationwide survey of childhood asthma in China’s urban areas. Annual mean concentrations of air pollutants and other climatic factors were obtained for the same period from several government departments. Data analysis was implemented with descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation coefficient, and multiple regression analysis. Results. Pearson correlation analysis showed that the situation of childhood asthma was strongly linked with SO2, relative humidity, and hours of sunshine (p<0.05). Multiple regression analysis indicated that, among the predictor variables in the final step, SO2 was found to be the most powerful predictor variable amongst all (β=-19.572, p < 0.05). Furthermore, results had shown that hours of sunshine (β = -0.014, p < 0.05) was a significant component summary predictor variable. Conclusion. The findings of this study do not suggest that air pollutants or climate, at least in terms of children, plays a major role in explaining regional differences in asthma prevalence in China.

AB  - Rationale: Patterns of longitudinal lung function growth and decline in childhood asthma have been shown to be important in determining risk for future respiratory ailments including chronic airway obstruction and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Objectives: To determine the genetic underpinnings of lung function patterns in subjects with childhood asthma.Methods: We performed a genome-wide association study of 581 non-Hispanic white individuals with asthma that were previously classified by patterns of lung function growth and decline (normal growth, normal growth with early decline, reduced growth, and reduced growth with early decline). The strongest association was also measured in two additional cohorts: a small asthma cohort and a large chronic obstructive pulmonary disease metaanalysis cohort. Interaction between the genomic region encompassing the most strongly associated single-nucleotide polymorphism and nearby genes was assessed by two chromosome conformation capture assays.Measurements and Main Results: An intergenic single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs4445257) on chromosome 8 was strongly associated with the normal growth with early decline pattern compared with all other pattern groups (P = 6.7 × 10-9; odds ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 2.0-4.0); replication analysis suggested this variant had opposite effects in normal growth with early decline and reduced growth with early decline pattern groups. Chromosome conformation capture experiments indicated a chromatin interaction between rs4445257 and the promoter of the distal CSMD3 gene.Conclusions: Early decline in lung function after normal growth is associated with a genetic polymorphism that may also protect against early decline in reduced growth groups. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00000575).

AB  - Background: Late-onset asthma (LOA) has distinct characteristics and its pathogenesis might rely on unique pathways. Although current studies are focused primarily on childhood asthma, more research is needed to show the mechanisms underlying LOA.Objective: To conduct genomewide association analysis and gene-based analysis to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms and genes associated with LOA.Methods: The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) observational cohort and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) were used to identify subjects with LOA. The association between LOA and body mass index and smoking was evaluated. In the discovery stage of the genetic analysis, 1,218 African American subjects from WHI with genotype data (271 cases and 947 controls) were used for single-nucleotide polymorphism and gene-based association analyses. Significant or suggestive results were subsequently investigated in an independent African American population from MESA (38 cases and 806 controls).Results: In WHI, the relative odds for LOA in obese vs normal-weight subjects was 2.55 (95% confidence interval 1.74-3.76). Ever smokers also had greater odds for LOA compared with never smokers (odds ratio 1.59, 95% confidence interval 1.21-2.09). The same trends were observed in MESA. In WHI, 6 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with LOA at a genomewide-suggestive significance level (P < 1.0 × 10(-5)). The gene ZNF248 was associated with LOA and reached genomewide significance (P = 4.0 × 10(-7)). In MESA, the association between ZNF248 and LOA was successfully replicated (P = .015).Conclusion: Smoking and obesity are risk factors for LOA. ZNF248 confers increased susceptibility to LOA in African Americans.

AB  - Objectives: To identify the relationship between temperature variation between neighbouring days (TVN) and hospital visits for childhood asthma in age- and sex-specific groups. Study design: An ecological design was used to explore the effect of TVN on hospital visits for childhood asthma. Methods: A Poisson generalised linear regression model combined with a distributed lag non-linear model was used to analyse the association between TVN and hospital visits for childhood asthma. All hospital visits for childhood asthma from June 2010 to July 2013 were included (n = 17,022). Daily climate data were obtained from Hefei Meteorological Bureau. Results: A significant correlation was found between TVN and hospital visits for childhood asthma in age- and sex-specific groups. For different gender groups, the effect of TVN on childhood asthma was the greatest at 3 and 5 days lag for males and females. For different age groups, the effect of TVN on childhood asthma was the greatest at 1 and 5 days lag for 0-4 years and 5-14 years children, respectively. A 1 °C increase in TVN was associated with a 4.2% (95% confidence interval 0.9-7.6%) increase in hospital visits for childhood asthma. Conclusions: TVN is associated with hospital visits for childhood asthma. Once the temperature change rapidly, guardians will be urged to pay more attention to their children's health, which may reduce the morbidity of childhood asthma.

AB  - Objective To describe parents'/carers' views of the characteristics of a clinical service model shown to improve asthma outcomes. Design A randomised controlled study on education intervention for childhood asthma by Indigenous health care workers. Setting Thursday Island, Horn Island and Bamaga. Participants Thirty-five children received the intervention and 53 were in the control group. At the last study visit 12 months after enrolment, carers were asked to give feedback about the clinical service delivered by paediatric respiratory physicians and the asthma education intervention. Intervention Additional asthma education. Main outcome measures Carers' responses to the open-ended questions were analysed separately by three Indigenous investigators who assigned codes and developed the themes. These were then cross-checked and combined to develop an overall interpretation of the data. Results The carers ( n = 81) of 88 children in the Torres Strait region of North Queensland reported positively to the clinical service delivery. Service was rated as excellent = 26.8%, very good = 51.2%, good = 19.5% and poor = 2.4%. Parents'/carers' views about the clinical service model were grouped into seven themes: clear communication by health professionals, service delivery, professional approach, clear transfer of knowledge and education/clinical knowledge of asthma, established rapport/caregiver satisfaction, importance of coming into the local community, and areas of concern for the carers/parents. Conclusion Community-based perspectives of an effective health service model include empowered Indigenous health care workers currently attached to the medical specialist service with elements of high expertise and appropriate cultural awareness that enabled clear communication and transfer of knowledge.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: Asthma guidelines recognize the presence of different asthma endotypes and phenotypes but treatment recommendations are limited to age groups rather than phenotypes, as the phenotype literature is regarded as emerging evidence. This review will examine the current evidence regarding the management of asthma in school age children (5-18 years old) by endotype and phenotype.Recent Findings: A number of studies have examined the effect of endotypes and phenotypes on response to conventional asthma therapy, omalizumab and specific allergen immunotherapy, and response in children with severe asthma. Emerging therapies, namely biologics and immunomodulators, have attracted considerable attention and appear to have favorable effects in adults with asthma, but additional pediatric studies are needed.Summary: The optimal treatment strategy for children with asthma is not yet defined and likely dependent on many patient and disease characteristics. Much of the phenotypic response literature presented in this review was constrained by a limited number of pediatric and adult studies available and as such should be regarded as preliminary. Better definition of asthma phenotypes and better targeting of therapy based on individual patient phenotypes are likely to improve asthma treatment in the future.

AB  - Objectives: To assess whether population-level violent (and all) crime rates were associated with population-level child asthma utilization rates and predictive of patient-level risk of asthma reutilization after a hospitalization.Study Design: A retrospective cohort study of 4638 pediatric asthma-related emergency department visits and hospitalizations between 2011 and 2013 was completed. For population-level analyses, census tract asthma utilization rates were calculated by dividing the number of utilization events within a tract by the child population. For patient-level analyses, hospitalized patients (n = 981) were followed until time of first asthma-related reutilization. The primary predictor was the census tract rate of violent crime as recorded by the police; the all crime (violent plus nonviolent) rate was also assessed.Results: Census tract-level violent and all crime rates were significantly correlated with asthma utilization rates (both P < .0001). The violent crime rate explained 35% of the population-level asthma utilization variance and remained associated with increased utilization after adjustment for census tract poverty, unemployment, substandard housing, and traffic exposure (P = .002). The all crime rate explained 28% of the variance and was similarly associated with increased utilization after adjustment (P = .02). Hospitalized children trended toward being more likely to reutilize if they lived in higher violent (P = .1) and all crime areas (P = .01). After adjustment, neither relationship was significant.Conclusions: Crime data could help facilitate early identification of potentially toxic stressors relevant to the control of asthma for populations and patients.

AB  - Background: To evaluate the association between maternal and paternal smoking during pregnancy, and asthma among offspring.Methods: We conducted a hospital-based birth retrospective observational birth cohort study in a University-based Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, Kuopio University Hospital, Finland. 39 306 women, delivering between 1989 and 2006, were linked to the national register for asthma reimbursement for their offspring (2641 asthmatics). Pregnancy factors were recorded during pregnancy.Results: The risk of asthma was significantly elevated if both parents smoked (aOR 3.7; 95 % Cl 3.2-4.4) and it remained high in only paternal smoking families (aOR 2.9; 95 % Cl 2.5-3.3) as well as only maternal smoking families (aOR 1.7; 95 % Cl 1.2-2.2). Paternal cessation of smoking during pregnancy seemed to reduce the risk of asthma regardless of maternal smoking (aOR 0.3-0.4).Conclusions: Parental smoking, and especially paternal smoking, was significantly associated with the risk of asthma in offspring and paternal cessation of smoking during pregnancy was associated with a decreased risk of childhood asthma regardless of maternal smoking. The results indicate that both parents should be encouraged to quit smoking during pregnancy, since it is a relatively easy and cheap way to reduce the risk of asthma in offspring.Trial Registration: The study is registered in Kuopio University Hospital register (TUTKI): ID5302448.

AB  - Background: Tracking longitudinal measurements of growth and decline in lung function in patients with persistent childhood asthma may reveal links between asthma and subsequent chronic airflow obstruction.Methods: We classified children with asthma according to four characteristic patterns of lung-function growth and decline on the basis of graphs showing forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), representing spirometric measurements performed from childhood into adulthood. Risk factors associated with abnormal patterns were also examined. To define normal values, we used FEV1 values from participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey who did not have asthma.Results: Of the 684 study participants, 170 (25%) had a normal pattern of lung-function growth without early decline, and 514 (75%) had abnormal patterns: 176 (26%) had reduced growth and an early decline, 160 (23%) had reduced growth only, and 178 (26%) had normal growth and an early decline. Lower baseline values for FEV1, smaller bronchodilator response, airway hyperresponsiveness at baseline, and male sex were associated with reduced growth (P<0.001 for all comparisons). At the last spirometric measurement (mean [±SD] age, 26.0±1.8 years), 73 participants (11%) met Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease spirometric criteria for lung-function impairment that was consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); these participants were more likely to have a reduced pattern of growth than a normal pattern (18% vs. 3%, P<0.001).Conclusions: Childhood impairment of lung function and male sex were the most significant predictors of abnormal longitudinal patterns of lung-function growth and decline. Children with persistent asthma and reduced growth of lung function are at increased risk for fixed airflow obstruction and possibly COPD in early adulthood. (Funded by the Parker B.

AB  - Background Although alcohol consumption has been suggested to have an effect on the immune system, it is unknown whether alcohol consumption has a role in developing allergic diseases. We aimed to examine the associations of total alcohol intake during pregnancy with the risks of childhood asthma and atopic eczema in a birth cohort in Japan. Methods Pregnant women were recruited at a maternal clinic from May 2000 to October 2001. The children who were born to these mothers were followed until November 2007. Total alcohol intake, including alcohol as a cooking ingredient, was assessed using 5-day dietary records. Mother reports of physician-diagnosed asthma and atopic eczema were annually obtained from the questionnaires. Asthma assessed by the American Thoracic Society Division of Lung Diseases questionnaire and atopic eczema assessed by International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questions were also obtained in 2007. A total of 350 children participated in the follow-up survey. Results Maternal total alcohol intake during pregnancy was associated with increased risks of atopic eczema before age 3. The positive association with atopic eczema was also observed when it was defined as before age 5. In the high versus the low tertile of maternal total alcohol intake, the estimated hazard ratios (HRs) of child's eczema were 1.90 (95% CI: 0.96 to 3.76) before age 3 and 1.74 (95% CI: 0.93 to 3.24) before age 5, respectively. The estimated HRs of child's asthma before age 3 was 1.61 (95% CI: 0.70 to 3.69) in the high versus the low of maternal total alcohol intake and 2.11 (95% CI: 0.93 to 4.81) among children having drinking mothers versus nondrinking mothers in pregnancy, although maternal alcohol intake during pregnancy was not significantly associated with the risk of asthma before age 5. Conclusions Alcohol consumption during pregnancy might have an effect on developing atopic eczema in offspring.

AB  - Background: Studies have revealed the efficacy of home-based environmental interventions on reduction of asthma symptoms as a strategy for managing asthma in children. A focus on education and behavior change alone is generally too limited to reduce exposure to asthma triggers that exist because of adverse housing conditions.Objective: To demonstrate that housing conditions as a focus of a health intervention should be considered more widely as an effective means of addressing serious health problems such as asthma.Methods: Residences of 41 families of children identified with some of the highest rates of asthma-related hospital visits were assessed for the presence of asthma triggers.Results: The intervention had a positive effect on lessening the effect of the child's asthma on the family's lives and activities. Reductions in frequency of negative effects of children's asthma on sleeping, job or work around the house, and family activity plans, fewer worries or concerns about children getting enough sleep and performing normal daily activities, and fewer adverse effects of children's asthma medications were reported. Reduced use of asthma medication, medication applications, and health visits were noted. Households with return visits had 50% lower hospital bills for childhood asthma treatment.Conclusion: Home environment conditions that lead to or exacerbate asthma may be reduced or eliminated by making minor repairs and introducing reasonable cleaning regimens that address sources of asthma triggers. This can produce greater awareness on the part of families about the presence of asthma triggers and motivate future action to address the conditions associated with these triggers.

AB  - Aim To explore and describe child-parent shared decision making for the management of childhood asthma. Methods A qualitative, descriptive, interview-based study was undertaken. Eight children and nine parents participated. The framework approach underpinned data analysis. Findings A dynamic model of the way children and parents transfer, shift and share asthma management decisions was uncovered. Asthma management decisions between children and parents were non-linear, with responsibility transferring from parent to child under different conditions. Children made a range of decisions about their asthma, often sharing decisions with their parents. However, during acute illness episodes, children often relied on parents to make decisions about their asthma. Conclusion Neither the child nor parent has complete autonomy over asthma management decisions. Decision making is a dynamic, shifting and shared process, dependent on contextual factors and child and parent decision preferences.

AB  - Omalizumab is effective in children with severe asthma, but its impact on medical cost in Japan is not clear. We evaluated the impact of omalizumab on medical cost by comparing the pre- vs post-omalizumab-initiation medical costs of 12 children with severe asthma who received omalizumab for 2 years, and calculating incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for omalizumab therapy. Health outcome was measured as hospital-free days (HFD). The median total medical costs and medication fee per patient increased significantly after omalizumab initiation because of the high cost of omalizumab. The median hospitalization fee per patient, however, decreased significantly after omalizumab initiation due to reduction in hospitalization. Omalizumab led to an estimated increase of 40.8 HFD per omalizumab responder patient per 2 years. The cost was JPY 20 868 per additional HFD. Omalizumab can therefore reduce hospitalization cost in children with severe asthma in Japan.

AB  - Background: Childhood asthma is a global problem affecting the respiratory health of children. Physical activity (PA) plays a role in the relationship between asthma and respiratory health. We hypothesized that a low level of PA would be associated with asthma in children and adolescents. The objectives of our study were to (1) summarize the evidence available on associations between PA and asthma prevalence in children and adolescents and (2) assess the role of PA in new-onset or incident asthma among children and adolescents.Methods: We searched Medline, the Cochrane Library, and Embase and extracted data from original articles that met the inclusion criteria. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) were used to express the results of the meta-analysis (forest plot). We explored heterogeneity using funnel plots and the Graphic Appraisal Tool for Epidemiology (GATE).Results: We retrieved 1,571 titles and selected 11 articles describing three cohort and eight cross-sectional studies for inclusion. A meta-analysis of the cohort studies revealed a risk of new-onset asthma in children with low PA (OR [95 % CI] 1.32 [0.95; 1.84] [random effects] and 1.35 [1.13; 1.62] [fixed effects]). Three cross-sectional studies identified significant positive associations between childhood asthma or asthma symptoms and low PA.Conclusions: Children and adolescents with low PA levels had an increased risk of new-onset asthma, and some had a higher risk of current asthma/or wheezing; however, there was some heterogeneity among the studies. This review reveals a critical need for future longitudinal assessments of low PA, its mechanisms, and its implications for incident asthma in children. The systematic review was prospectively registered at PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42014013761; available at: http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO [accessed: 24 March 2016]).

AB  - Rationale: Growing up on a farm protects from childhood asthma and early wheeze. Virus-triggered wheeze in infancy predicts asthma in individuals with a genetic asthma risk associated with chromosome 17q21.Objectives: To test environmental determinants of infections and wheeze in the first year of life, potential modifications of these associations by 17q21, and the implications for different trajectories of wheeze.Methods: We followed 983 children in rural areas of Europe from birth until age 6 years. Symptoms of wheeze, rhinitis, fever, and environmental exposures were documented with weekly diaries during year 1. Asthma at age 6 was defined as ever having a reported doctor's diagnosis. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms related to ORMDL3 (rs8076131) and GSDMB (rs7216389, rs2290400) at 17q21 were genotyped.Measurements and Main Results: Early wheeze was positively associated with presence of older siblings among carriers of known asthma risk alleles at 17q21 (e.g., rs8076131) (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-2.01). Exposure to farm animal sheds was inversely related to wheeze (aOR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.33-0.60). Both effects were similarly observed in children with transient wheeze up to age 3 years without subsequent development of asthma (aOR, 1.71 [95% CI, 1.09-2.67]; and aOR, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.30-0.76], respectively).Conclusions: These findings suggest that the chromosome 17q21 locus relates to episodes of acute airway obstruction common to both transient wheeze and asthma. The previously identified asthma risk alleles are the ones susceptible to environmental influences. Thus, this gene-environment interaction reveals two faces of 17q21: The same genotype constitutes genetic risk and allows for environmental protection, thereby providing options for prospective prevention strategies.

AB  - Background: Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are effective maintenance treatments for childhood asthma; however, many children remain uncontrolled. Vilanterol (VI) is an inhaled long-acting beta-2 agonist which, in combination with the ICS fluticasone furoate, is being explored as a once-daily treatment for asthma in children. We evaluated the dose-response, efficacy, and safety of once-daily VI (6.25 μg, 12.5 μg and 25 μg) administered in the evening over 4 weeks, on background fluticasone propionate (FP) in children with asthma inadequately controlled on ICS.Methods: This was a Phase IIb, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study in children ages 5-11 years with persistent asthma on ICS and as-needed short-acting beta-agonist. The study comprised a 4-week run-in, 4-week treatment period, and 1-week follow-up. From study start, children replaced their current ICS with open-label FP 100 μg twice daily. Children were randomised to receive placebo, VI 6.25 μg, VI 12.5 μg or VI 25 μg once daily. Primary endpoint was treatment difference between VI 25 and placebo groups in mean change from baseline in evening peak expiratory flow averaged over the 4-week treatment. Secondary endpoints included change from baseline in trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) at Week 4 and change from baseline in percentage of rescue-free and symptom-free 24-h periods. Safety assessments included incidence of adverse events (AEs) and asthma exacerbations.Results: In total, 456 children comprised the intention-to-treat population. The adjusted treatment difference between VI 25 and placebo groups for the primary endpoint was not statistically significant (p = 0.227) so no statistical inference was made for other VI dose comparisons or other endpoints. No difference in change from baseline in trough FEV1 was observed for any VI treatments versus placebo; however, VI 25 resulted in an additional 0.6 rescue-free days and 0.7 symptom-free days per week versus placebo. The incidence of AEs was slightly higher in the VI groups (28-33 %) versus placebo (22 %). Nine children experienced asthma exacerbations during the treatment period.Conclusion: VI plus FP did not result in significant improvements in lung function versus placebo plus FP, but was well tolerated at all doses assessed.Trial Registration: NCT01573767 (ClinicalTrials.gov).

AB  - Background: An association has been suggested between asthma and orbital immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD).Objective: To explore this association, including asthma characteristics and risk factors.Methods: A retrospective, computer-assisted search identified patients with orbital IgG4-RD seen at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota from 1997 to 2014. Asthma prevalence and its related clinical and radiologic characteristics were studied.Results: Thirty-one patients (17 men) with biopsy-proven orbital IgG4-RD were identified. Mean age at diagnosis was 54.3 years (SD 11.0 years). Median duration from onset of orbital symptoms to IgG4-RD diagnosis was 1.96 years (range 0.1-31.8 years). Twenty-two patients (71%) were not smokers, 6 (19%) were former smokers, and 3 (10%) were current smokers. Sixteen patients (52%) had asthma. Three patients had childhood asthma onset, and median age at asthma onset in the 7 patients with data available was 56 years (range 15-62 years). In this cohort, the most common findings at chest computed tomography were mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy (44%), linear scarring (20%), and nodules and bronchial wall thickening (16%). Bronchial wall thickening correlated with presence of asthma. Chronic sinusitis (94%) was most commonly associated with asthma. Serum IgG4 was markedly increased in patients with asthma (median 195.0 mg/dL, range 31.8-1,790.0 mg/dL) vs patients without asthma (median 78.9 mg/dL, range 7.7-166.0 mg/dL; P = .02). Treatment was commonly prednisone and then rituximab; rituximab helped control asthma in most cases. Two deaths were reported (median follow-up 4.2 years).Conclusion: Asthma is commonly associated with orbital IgG4-RD and generally manifests as adult-onset bronchial wall thickening seen at computed tomography, increased serum IgG4 levels, and good rituximab response.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: This review describes the literature over the past 18 months that evaluated childhood asthma phenotypes, highlighting the key aspects of these studies, and comparing these studies to previous ones in this area.Recent Findings: Recent studies on asthma phenotypes have identified new phenotypes on the basis of statistical analyses (using cluster analysis and latent class analysis methodology) and have evaluated the outcomes and associated risk factors of previously established early childhood asthma phenotypes that are based on asthma onset and patterns of wheezing illness. There have also been investigations focusing on immunologic, physiologic, and genetic correlates of various phenotypes, as well as identification of subphenotypes of severe childhood asthma.Summary: Childhood asthma remains a heterogeneous condition, and investigations into these various presentations, risk factors, and outcomes are important since they can offer therapeutic and prognostic relevance. Further investigation into the immunopathology and genetic basis underlying childhood phenotypes is important so therapy can be tailored accordingly.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: It has been well studied that aeroallergen, mold, and airborne pollutant exposure in the inner-city home environment is associated with significant childhood asthma morbidity. Although the home environment has been extensively studied, the school environment is less well understood.Recent Findings: In this article, we discuss the relationship between environmental exposures within the school and daycare environment and pediatric asthma morbidity and novel environmental interventions designed to help mitigate pediatric asthma morbidity.Summary: Studies assessing environmental exposures outside the home environment and interventions to mitigate these exposures have the potential to reduce pediatric asthma morbidity. Further study in this area should focus on the complex cost benefit analyses of environmental interventions outside the home setting, while controlling for the home environment.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: First, to review how the global rise in prevalence of asthma prompted studies of the relationships between microbial exposure in early infancy, the rate and pattern of development of immune function, and the development of allergic sensitization and of wheezing in childhood. And, second, to review how those studies laid the groundwork for a possible strategy for primary prevention of asthma through manipulation of the microbiome of the gastrointestinal and/or respiratory tracts.Recent Findings: Atopy and asthma are complex diseases thought to result from a 'gene-by-environment' interaction; the rapidity of their rise in prevalence points to a change in environment as most likely causal. Epidemiologic studies noting associations between events in infancy and later development of atopic diseases have suggested that their rise in prevalence is related to a deficiency in microbial exposure in early life. The findings from birth cohort studies of humans and from interventional studies of mice converge in suggesting that a deficiency in microbial colonization of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract by certain commensal microbes results in skewed development of systemic and/or local immune function that increases susceptibility to allergic sensitization and to viral lower respiratory infection. Recent studies are now honing in on identifying the microbes, or collection of microbes, whose collective functions are necessary for induction of immune tolerance, and thus of reduced susceptibility.Summary: Atopy and asthma appear to have their roots in an insufficiency of early-life exposure to the diverse environmental microbiota necessary to ensure colonization of the gastrointestinal and/or respiratory tracts with the commensal microbes necessary for induction of balanced, toleragenic immune function. Identification of the commensal bacteria necessary, now ever closer at hand, will lay the groundwork for the development of strategies for primary prevention of atopic disease, especially of childhood asthma.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: This article presents recent findings and perspectives on the relationship between early-life respiratory infections and asthma inception, and discusses emerging concepts on strategies that target these infectious agents for asthma prevention.Recent Findings: Cumulative evidence supports the role of early-life viral infections, especially respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus, as major antecedents of childhood asthma. These viruses may have different mechanistic roles in the pathogenesis of asthma. The airway microbiome and virus-bacteria interactions in early life have emerged as additional determinants of childhood asthma. Innovative strategies for the prevention of these early-life infections, or for attenuation of acute infection severity, are being investigated and may identify effective strategies for the primary and secondary prevention of childhood asthma.Summary: Early-life infections are major determinants of asthma development. The pathway from early-life infections to asthma is the result of complex interactions between the specific type of the virus, genetic, and environmental factors. Novel intervention strategies that target these infectious agents have been investigated in proof-of-concepts trials, and further study is necessary to determine their capacity for asthma prevention.

AB  - Lifetime childhood asthma prevalence (LCAP) percentages in Puerto Rico Health Regions (HR) are substantially higher in northeastern vs. southwestern HR. Higher average relative humidity in the northeast might promote mold and mite exposures and possibly asthma prevalence. To test this hypothesis, mold contamination, Environmental Relative Moldiness Index (ERMI) values were measured in floor dust (n = 26) and dust mite allergen concentrations in bed dust (n = 14). For this analysis, the eight HR were divided into those with LCAP > 30 % (n = 3) and <  30 % (n = 5). The average ERMI value was significantly greater (Wilcoxon Rank Sum,p < 0.001) in high than in low LCAP HR (14.5 vs. 9.3). The dust mite antigens Der p 1, Der f 1, and Blo t 5 were detected in 90 % of bed samples, but the concentrations were not significantly different in high vs. low LCAP HR. Mold exposures might partially explain the differences in LCAP HR in Puerto Rico.

AB  - Exposure to indoor allergens plays an important role in the etiology of asthma. This study was designed to quantify indoor allergens from homes of families that had at least one case of childhood asthma at home in a southwestern city of Iran. The relationship between the indoor allergen levels and home characteristics was also investigated. Dust samples were collected from the bedrooms and the kitchens of 35 homes where children with persistent asthma were living. The levels of indoor allergens were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Detectable amounts of mite, mouse and cockroach allergens were found in all evaluated places. None of our patients were exposed to a threshold concentration of indoor allergen for sensitizing at home. Regarding of mite allergens, the levels of Der f1 were significantly higher than Der p1 and a direct correlation was observed between living in an apartment and Der f1 levels. Moreover, Fel d1 (cat) and Bla g1 (cockroach) allergens were found in the children's bedrooms more frequently than those in the kitchens. In this study, direct associations were obtained between Bla g1 allergen and the duration of occupancy and between Fel d1 and average home size. A total of 34.2% of the patients showed positive skin reactions to at least one of the tested allergens as 17.1% of them showed reactivity to D. pteronyssinus. Proper controlling of cockroaches and mice by public health officials would be a practical approach to avoid inducing asthma or worsening the symptoms.

AB  - Objective: To assess our prospective mother-child cohort and the national registry data to analyze the risk of asthma by delivery mode and whether cesarean delivery before or after membrane rupture affects this risk differently.Study Design: The Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood2000 is a high-risk birth cohort of 411 Danish children. Asthma was diagnosed prospectively by physicians at the research site, and associations with cesarean delivery were investigated using Cox proportional hazard models. From the Danish national prospective registry we included data from 1997-2010. Childhood asthma was defined from recurrent use of inhaled corticosteroids filled at pharmacies. Cesarean delivery was classified as either before or after rupture of membranes, and the risk of asthma was compared with vaginal delivery. Results were adjusted stepwise for age and calendar year, sex, birth weight, gestational age, multiple births, parity, and maternal factors (age, smoking/antibiotics during pregnancy, employment status, and asthma).Results: In the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood2000 cohort, the adjusted hazard ratio for asthma was increased by cesarean delivery relative to vaginal birth 2.18 (1.27-3.73). Registry data replicated these findings. Cesarean delivery performed before rupture of membranes carried significantly higher risk of asthma, (incidence rate ratio to vaginal delivery 1.20 [1.16-1.23]) than cesarean delivery after rupture of membranes (incidence rate ratio to vaginal delivery 1.12 [1.09-1.16]).Conclusions: We confirmed cesarean delivery to be a risk factor for childhood asthma. This effect was more pronounced for cesarean delivery performed before rupture of membranes.

AB  - Childhood asthma is a growing health concern. Asthma is the most common chronic illness of childhood and a leading cause of emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and school absenteeism. School nurses play a valuable role in asthma management. The purpose of this integrative review is to examine barriers to asthma management for school nurses in the school setting. Findings revealed multiple barriers school nurses encounter in managing asthma. Six themes emerged that included lack of resources and support, insufficient time, communication challenges, limited knowledge, and lack of awareness of school nurses’ expertise. Students, parents, primary care physicians, school administration, staff, and school nurses themselves all play a role in constructing barriers to asthma management. There is a need for school nurses and school nurse leaders to focus efforts to develop strategies to overcome barriers to ensure evidence-based, best practice management of asthma in the school setting.

AB  - Childhood asthma is a prevalent and costly chronic condition. Optimal management enables secondary and tertiary prevention. The goal was to identify population health considerations for pediatric asthma in California to inform the development of quality improvement interventions. California Health Interview Survey 2011-2012 is a random-digit dial telephone survey conducted in 5 languages. It includes 44,000 households from all 58 counties in California. This study assessed factors related to symptom control and health care use in children ages 2-11 years with asthma. An estimated 492,385 (9.6%) of children in California currently have asthma. Urban and rural residents face comparable asthma disease burdens. School-age male children as well as Asian and African American children are disproportionately affected. Asthma causes significant morbidity, with poorer health status, high utilization of emergency care, and the need for daily medication use. Only 38% of children with asthma have a recent asthma management plan. Half of all children with asthma did not receive influenza immunization in the past year, although this reflects the overall low rate of influenza vaccination. Parents of children with asthma frequently utilize the Internet for health information and communication with their child's health care provider. Children with asthma in California face several population-level challenges, including poor health status, low influenza vaccination rates, high use of emergency care, and suboptimal use of health literacy tools. Focusing on improved care coordination and preventive care for high-risk groups is especially urgent given the expansion of public health insurance and impending shortages in the primary care workforce.

AB  - Background: We have shown in a previous population-based study significant correlation between childhood asthma and early abnormalities of lipid and glucose metabolism. This study's specific aim was to determine whether maternal nutrition in pregnancy affects postnatal metabolic and respiratory outcomes in the offspring.Methods: On gestation day 1, dams were switched from standard chow to either high-fat hypercaloric diet or control diet. Terminal experiments were performed on newborn and weanling offspring of dams fed the study diet during gestation and lactation, and on adult offspring maintained on the same diet as their mother.Results: Pups born from high-fat hypercaloric diet (HFD) dams developed metabolic abnormalities persistent throughout development. Cytokine expression analysis of lung tissues from newborns born to HFD dams revealed a strong proinflammatory pattern. Gene expression of neurotrophic factors and receptors was upregulated in lungs of weanlings born to HFD dams, and this was associated to higher respiratory system resistance and lower compliance at baseline, as well as hyperreactivity to aerosolized methacholine. Furthermore, HFD dams delivered pups prone to develop more severe disease after respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection.Conclusion: Maternal nutrition in pregnancy is a critical determinant of airway inflammation and hyperreactivity in offspring and also increases risk for bronchiolitis independent from prepregnancy nutrition.

AB  - Asthma and allergic diseases are among the most prevalent chronic noncommunicable diseases of childhood, but the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms are poorly understood. Because epigenetic mechanisms link gene regulation to environmental cues and developmental trajectories, their contribution to asthma and allergy pathogenesis is under active investigation. DNA methylation signatures associated with concurrent disease and with the development of asthma during childhood asthma have been identified, but their significance is not easily interpretable. On the other hand, the characterization of early epigenetic predictors of asthma points to a potential role of epigenetic mechanisms in regulating the inception of, and the susceptibility to, this disease.

AB  - Rationale: The new cytokine IL-37 has been described as a negative regulator of innate immunity. It reduces activation of dendritic cells and the production of proinflammatory mediators in murine and human immune cells. Although recent results from the CLARA childhood asthma cohort suggested an impact of IL-37 on human asthma pathogenesis, the receptor for IL-37 and its implication in adaptive immune responses have not been determined.Objectives: This study aimed to clarify whether IL-37 also provides antiinflammatory effects on adaptive immune responses and through which receptor it exerts its effects.Methods: IL-37 levels in supernatants of restimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from children with asthma and healthy children were determined. Mice (wild-type, IL-18Rα(-/-), and SIGIRR/IL-1R8(-/-)) were sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA) and challenged with OVA aerosol to induce acute allergic experimental asthma, and IL-37 was applied intranasally during OVA challenge. Airway hyperresponsiveness was determined. A cytometric bead array was used to assess cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Epithelial mucus was quantified on the basis of lung sections stained with periodic acid-Schiff reagent, using the newCAST microscope system.Measurements and Main Results: Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells of subjects with allergic asthma produce less IL-37 compared with healthy control subjects. In mice, intranasal administration of IL-37 dampened allergic airway inflammation as well as proinflammatory cytokine production, mucus hyperproduction, and airway hyperresponsiveness. However, the antiinflammatory effects of IL-37 were completely abolished in mice deficient for IL-18Rα or SIGIRR/IL-1R8.Conclusions: This study demonstrates that IL-37 reduces allergic airway inflammation directed by type 2 helper T cells and the hallmarks of experimental asthma in mice, suggesting that IL-37 may be critical for asthma pathogenesis in particular and may have an impact on adaptive immunity in general. Furthermore, these data suggest a mode of action of IL-37 that involves binding to IL-18Rα and subsequent heterodimerization with or activation of SIGIRR/IL-1R8. Therefore, IL-37 or its receptors could be potential targets for asthma intervention.

AB  - Background: Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in childhood. According to guidelines, a diagnosis of asthma should be confirmed using lung function testing in children aged >6 years. Previous studies indicate that asthma in children is probably overdiagnosed. However, the extent has not previously been assessed.Aim: To assess the extent and characteristics of confirmed and unconfirmed diagnoses of asthma in children who were diagnosed by their GP as having asthma or who were treated as having asthma.Design and Setting: Retrospective analysis in four academic primary healthcare centres in Utrecht, the Netherlands.Method: Routine care registration data of children aged 6-18 years who received a diagnosis of asthma or were treated as having asthma were analysed.Results: In only 16.1% (n = 105) of the children diagnosed with asthma was the diagnosis confirmed with spirometry, whereas in 23.2% (n = 151) the signs and symptoms did give rise to suspected asthma but the children should have undergone further lung function tests. In more one-half (53.5%, n = 349) of the children the signs and symptoms made asthma unlikely and thus they were most likely overdiagnosed. The remaining 7.2% (n = 47) were probably correctly classified as not having asthma. The main reasons for classifying asthma without children undergoing further lung function tests were dyspnoea (31.9%, n = 174), cough (26.0%, n = 142), and wheezing (10.4%, n = 57).Conclusion: Overdiagnosis of childhood asthma is common in primary care, leading to unnecessary treatment, disease burden, and impact on quality of life. However, only in a small percentage of children is a diagnosis of asthma confirmed by lung function tests.

AB  - Background: Tobacco smoke exposure increases breathing problems of children. Texas Children's Health Plan is a Managed Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) managed care provider. The aim of this study is to determine associations among tobacco smoke exposure, asthma prevalence, and asthma health-care utilization.Methods: Texas Children's Health Plan conducts an annual survey of members who have a physician visit. Questions were added to the survey in March 2010 about asthma and tobacco smoke exposure. Survey results for children < 18 years of age were matched to health plan claims data for the 12 months following the date of the physician visit.Results: A total of 22,470 parents of unique members/patients from birth to < 18 years of age participated in the survey. More whites than African Americans or Hispanics report that the child's mother is a smoker (19.5% vs 9.1% and vs 2.3%, respectively; P < .001). Compared with children whose mother does not smoke, parent report of asthma diagnosis and claims for dispensing of short-acting beta agonist medication are greater if the mother is a smoker (adjusted OR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.03-1.40] and 1.24 [95% CI, 1.08-1.42], respectively). In contrast to Medicaid, in which there are no out-of-pocket costs, the CHIP line of business requires copays for ED visits. ED visits are influenced by maternal smoking only in the CHIP line of business (adjusted OR, 4.40; 95% CI, 1.69-11.44).Conclusion: Maternal smoking increases risk for asthma diagnosis and prescription of asthma quick relief medication. Maternal smoking predicted asthma-related ED visits only for the CHIP line of business.

AB  - Three concomitant phenomena occur in the later years of childhood: increases in the incidence of asthma, obesity and early menarche. This article is an overview of the current epidemiologic, basic, genetic and epigenetic evidence about this relationship. As a consequence we propose that obese girls who have an early menarche (≤ 11 years of age) constitute a new asthma phenotype in childhood. Future studies need to be carried out in order to find the best control and treatment of this new asthma phenotype.

AB  - Purpose This study tested the efficacy of a nurse-led discharge planning program for childhood asthma management, based on transition theory. Methods A quasi-experimental design was used. The sample comprised 120 children with asthma and their parents (intervention group n = 60, control group n = 60). Findings The asthma management self-efficacy perception level of parents in the intervention group increased significantly and the number of triggers their children were exposed to at home was reduced by 60.8%. The rates of admission to emergency departments and unscheduled outpatient visits were significantly lower in the intervention group compared with the control group. Conclusions Transition theory-based nursing interventions can provide successful outcomes on childhood asthma management. Practice Implications Transition theory-based discharge planning program can guide nursing interventions to standardize care of the child with asthma. Combining care at home with hospital care strengthens ongoing qualified asthma management.

AB  - Children with acute severe asthma exacerbation are at risk of developing respiratory failure. Moreover, conventional aggressive management might be futile in acute severe asthma requiring intubation and invasive ventilation. The aim of this review is to detail evidence on the use of ketamine in childhood asthma exacerbations. A search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases was performed, using different combinations of the following terms: ketamine, asthma, use, exacerbation, and childhood. In addition, we searched the references of the identified articles for additional articles. We then reviewed titles and included studies that were relevant to the topic of interest. Finally, the search was limited to studies published in English and Spanish from 1918 to June 2015. Due to the scarcity in the literature, we included all published articles. The literature reports conflicting results of ketamine use for acute severe asthma in children. Taking into consideration the relatively good safety profile of the drug, ketamine might be a reasonable option in the management of acute severe asthma in children who fail to respond to standard therapy. Furthermore, pediatricians and pediatric emergency clinicians administering ketamine should be knowledgeable about the unique actions of this drug and its potential side effects.

AB  - Background: The prevalence of asthma and other allergic diseases among children living in Eastern is not well described. Our objective was to estimate and compare the prevalence of asthma, respiratory symptoms and allergic diseases in children in Belarus, Ukraine, and Poland as well as to identify risk factors for these conditions. We also sought to profile and compare children with asthma between locations.Methods: Data were collected as a part of an international, multicenter, cross-sectional study of childhood asthma: The Belarus Ukraine Poland Asthma Study (BUPAS). Subjects were children aged 7-13 years attending primary and secondary schools in the urban and surrounding rural area of Grodno (Belarus), Ternopil (Ukraine) and Silesia Region (Poland). Physician-diagnosed respiratory diseases and symptoms as well as allergic diseases were ascertained using the ISAAC questionnaire completed by the parents.Results: In total there were 4019 children from Belarus (rural: 2018, urban: 2001), 4493 from Ukraine (1972; 2521), and 4036 from Poland (2002, 2034). The overall response rate was 76.7%. Groups were similar in case of gender and age (p > 0.05). Almost all analyzed respiratory and allergic conditions differed significantly between countries including asthma [Poland (rural, urban): 3.5%, 4.1%; Ukraine: 1.4%, 2.1%; Belarus: 1.4%, 1.5%], spastic bronchitis (Poland: 2.7%, 3.2%; Ukraine: 7.5%, 6.5%; Belarus: 6.4%, 7.9%), and chest wheeze in the last year (Poland: 4.8%, 5.2%; Ukraine: 11.5%, 13.0%; Belarus: 10.7%, 10.0%). These differences remained after adjustment for potential confounders. Risk factor associations were generally similar between outcomes. Symptom characteristics of children with asthma between countries were not consistent. The ratio of current wheeze:diagnosis of asthma differed by country: (Rural areas: Belarus: 10.9:1, Ukraine: 17.3:1, Poland: 2.4:1; Urban areas: Belarus: 8.1:1, Ukraine: 7.3:1 Poland: 1.9:1).Conclusions: The findings show large between-country differences and relatively low prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases in children of Western Belarus and Ukraine. There is evidence for underdiagnosis of asthma in these regions.

AB  - Rationale: Cohort studies suggest that airflow obstruction is established early in life, manifests as childhood asthma and wheezy bronchitis, and continues into early adulthood. Although an association between childhood asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in later life has been demonstrated, it is unclear if childhood wheezy bronchitis is associated with COPD.Objectives: To investigate whether childhood wheezy bronchitis increases the risk of COPD in the seventh decade.Methods: A cohort of children recruited in 1964 at age 10 to 15 years, which was followed up in 1989, 1995, and 2001, was followed up again in 2014 when at age 60 to 65 years. Discrete time-to-event and linear mixed effects models were used.Measurements and Main Results: FEV1 and FVC were measured. COPD was defined as post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC <0.7. Childhood wheezing phenotype was related to 1989, 1995, 2001, and 2014 spirometry data. Three hundred thirty subjects, mean age 61 years, were followed up: 38 with childhood asthma; 53 with childhood wheezy bronchitis; and 239 control subjects (of whom 57 developed adulthood-onset wheeze between ages 16 and 46 yr). In adjusted multivariate analyses, childhood asthma was associated with an increased risk of COPD (odds ratio, 6.37; 95% confidence interval, 3.73-10.94), as was childhood wheezy bronchitis (odd ratio 1.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-2.91). The COPD risk increased with childhood asthma, and wheezy bronchitis was associated with reduced FEV1 that was evident by the fifth decade and not an accelerated rate of FEV1 decline. In contrast, adulthood-onset wheeze was associated with accelerated FEV1 decline.Conclusions: Childhood wheezy bronchitis and asthma are associated with an increased risk of COPD and reduced ventilatory function.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Assessing the knowledge and awareness of the Saudi society about bronchial asthma in children. METHODS: Structured questionnaires were randomly distributed to 1039 Saudi Arabians in May 2014 at Jeddah, Riyadh, and Dammam. RESULTS: The awareness of bronchial asthma questions showed that 67% of total sample thought that it could be a fatal disease, and only 13.2% thought that there is a difference between bronchial asthma and chest allergies in children. 86.1% thought that the symptoms of bronchial asthma include dyspnea and nocturnal cough, and 45.7% thought that fever, a runny nose and throat inflammation are not symptoms. 60.2% thought that infectious respiratory diseases may increase bronchial asthma progression. In addition, 40% thought that the use of antibiotics doesn’t help in diminishing bronchial asthma complications, and some thought that the patient can stop medication after an acute asthma attack. 34.1% thought that inhaled medication for asthma doesn’t cause addiction. Very highly significant results are shown between bronchial asthma knowledge and age, the level of education, marital status, and if the individual knows a person who suffers from bronchial asthma (P < 0.001). There are positive correlations between bronchial asthma knowledge and age, marital status, and level of education (r = 0.152, 0.150, 0.197), respectively. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that bronchial asthma knowledge in the Saudi Arabian population is insufficient, and efforts should be carried out to spread bronchial asthma management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood asthma prevalence doubled from 1980 to 1995 and then increased more slowly from 2001 to 2010. During this second period, racial disparities increased. More recent trends remain to be described. METHODS: We analyzed current asthma prevalence using 2001-2013 National Health Interview Survey data for children ages 0 to 17 years. Logistic regression with quadratic terms was used to test for nonlinear patterns in trends. Differences between demographic subgroups were further assessed with multivariate models controlling for gender, age, poverty status, race/ethnicity, urbanicity, and geographic region. RESULTS: Overall, childhood asthma prevalence increased from 2001 to 2009 followed by a plateau then a decline in 2013. From 2001 to 2013, multivariate logistic regression showed no change in prevalence among non-Hispanic white and Puerto Rican children and those in the Northeast and West; increasing prevalence among 10- to 17-year-olds, poor children, and those living in the South; increasing then plateauing prevalence among 5- to 9-year-olds, near-poor children, and non-Hispanic black children; and increasing then decreasing prevalence among 0- to 4-year-olds, nonpoor, and Mexican children and those in the Midwest. Non-Hispanic black-white disparities stopped increasing, and Puerto Rican children remained with the highest prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: Current asthma prevalence ceased to increase among children in recent years and the non-Hispanic black-white disparity stopped increasing due mainly to plateauing prevalence among non-Hispanic black children.

AB  - Purpose: To validate electronic versions of the Mini Pediatric and Pediatric Asthma Caregiver's Quality of Life Questionnaires (MiniPAQLQ and PACQLQ, respectively), determine completion times and correlate QOL of children and caregivers.Methods: A total of 63 children and 64 caregivers completed the paper and electronic MiniPAQLQ or PACQLQ. Agreement between versions of each questionnaire was summarized by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). The correlation between MiniPAQLQ and PACQLQ scores from child-caregiver pairs was assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient.Results: There was no significant difference (mean difference = 0.1, 95% CI -0.1, 0.2) in MiniPAQLQ Overall Scores between paper (5.9 ± 1.0, mean ± SD) and electronic (5.8 ± 1.0) versions, or any of the domains. ICCs ranged from 0.89 (Overall) to 0.86 (Emotional Function). Overall PACQLQ scores for both versions were comparable (5.9 ± 0.9 and 5.8 ± 1.0; mean difference = 0.0; 95% CI -0.1, 0.2). ICCs ranged from 0.81 (Activity Limitation) to 0.88 (Emotional Function). The electronic PACQLQ took 26 s longer (95% CI 11, 41; p < 0.001). Few participants (3-11%) preferred the paper format. MiniPAQLQ and PACQLQ scores were significantly correlated (all p < 0.05) for Overall (r paper = 0.33, r electronic = 0.27) and Emotional Function domains (r paper = 0.34, r electronic = 0.29).Conclusions: These electronic QOL questionnaires are valid, and asthma-related QOL of children and caregivers is related.

AB  - Background: Atopic diseases are a major burden of disease on a global scale. Regarding their aetiology, the early years of life are assumed to play a crucial role. In addition, there is growing evidence that elucidating the impact of cross-generational effects and epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation can substantially widen the scientific knowledge of the occurrence and progression of these diseases. We are thus aiming at following the course of asthma, allergies, and potential risk factors for their occurrence across three generations by establishing a birth cohort in the offspring of an existing population-based cohort.Methods/design: 2051 young adults who have been recruited in 1995 for Phase II of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) and who have subsequently been followed-up by the Study on Occupational Allergy Risks (SOLAR) are asked bi-annually since 2009 if they conceived a child in the meantime. If parenthood is reported, parents are invited to enrol along with their children in the ACROSSOLAR cohort. Participation involves completing a questionnaire assessing general and health-related information about the course of the pregnancy and the first year of life of their children. Subsequently, the children are followed up until primary school age when asthma and allergies can be diagnosed reliably. In addition, DNA for epigenetic analysis will be collected and analysed. Longitudinal data analysis techniques will then be used to assess potential associations between early-life exposures and onset of childhood asthma and allergies taking into account epigenetics.Discussion: Birth cohorts are especially suited to elucidate the impact of genetic predisposition, epigenetics, exposures during the first years of life, and gene-environment interactions on the occurrence and progression of asthma and allergies. By building upon an existing cohort, ACROSSOLAR offers a unique and cost-effective opportunity to investigate the aetiology of atopic disease in a prospective and cross-generational way.

Approximately half (54.5%) of the respondents were very familiar with at least one of the childhood asthma management guidelines. The majority of respondents (86.8%) followed guideline recommendations when prescribing initial maintenance therapy for childhood asthma, while 89.2% and 68.0% followed guideline recommendations regarding step-up and step-down therapy respectively.Discussion: Overall familiarity with childhood asthma management guidelines could be improved. There is scope for improvement in the adherence to these guidelines when prescribing medication in childhood asthma, particularly for step-down therapy.

AB  - Background: Asthma is a heterogeneous disorder with different phenotypes, and age at onset may define part of them. Little is known about possible association between prenatal stress and asthma phenotypes according to age at onset. We aim to investigate whether there is an association between prenatal stress and asthma, and if so, whether such an association differs according to age at asthma onset. Methods: We carried out a cohort study based on several national registers in Denmark, including all live singletons born during 1996-2007 in Denmark (N = 750058). We identified children born to mothers who lost a close relative (a child, partner/spouse, a parent or a sibling) 1 year prior to or during pregnancy as the bereaved group. Using Cox proportional hazards regression model, we evaluated the hazard ratios (HRs) for asthma in children of bereaved mothers, compared with children of non-bereaved mothers. Results: Prenatal stress following maternal bereavement was associated with a marginally increased risk of asthma events in children aged 0-3 years [HR = 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00-1.07], while unexpected bereavement was associated with a higher risk (HR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.02-1.24). There was no association between prenatal bereavement and asthma in children aged 4-15 years (HR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.96-1.09). Conclusions: Prenatal stress is possibly associated with asthma events in children aged 0-3 years, but not with asthma in children aged 4-15 years irrespective of age at asthma onset.

AB  - Background: In 2013, 20% of U.S. households with children experienced food insecurity. Asthma afflicts over 7 million children; prevalence has steadily increased while incidence peaks in young children. Asthma and food insecurity share the determinants of poverty and race that are associated with weight, yet limited research on the relation between food insecurity and asthma exists.Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the association between food insecurity and asthma in a diverse sample of children.Methods: Cross-sectional data from grade 3 of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort were analyzed (n = 11,099). Food security based on the USDA module and asthma diagnosis were reported by parents; anthropometric factors were measured. Multivariate logistic regression models of food security and asthma were analyzed overall and by race/ethnicity.Results: Children in food-insecure households had a 4% higher adjusted odds of asthma (95% CI: 1.02, 1.06). Adjusted odds of asthma were also higher by 70% for males (95% CI: 1.69, 1.71), 53% for non-Hispanic black (NHB) children (95% CI: 1.51, 1.54), 20% for Hispanic children (95% CI: 1.19, 1.21), 38% for overweight children (95% CI: 1.36, 1.39), 67% for obese children (95% CI: 1.65, 1.68), 23% for low-birth weight children (95% CI: 1.21, 1.24), 24% if mothers had a high school diploma (95% CI: 1.23, 1.26), and 33% if mothers had some college education (95% CI: 1.32, 1.35). High-birth weight children (OR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.85) and those with foreign-born mothers (OR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.53) had lower odds of asthma. Being food-insecure remained positively associated with asthma in non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics but was inversely associated with odds among NHBs. Odds of asthma doubled (OR: 2.00; 95% CI: 1.97, 2.03) for all children in households that were both food-insecure and poor; this relation remained positive in race/ethnicity-specific models.Conclusions: Food insecurity is positively associated with asthma in U.S. third graders, and household poverty strengthens the association.

AB  - Rationale: The influence of particulate air pollution on respiratory health starts in utero. Fetal lung growth and structural development occurs in stages; thus, effects on postnatal respiratory disorders may differ based on timing of exposure.Objectives: We implemented an innovative method to identify sensitive windows for effects of prenatal exposure to particulate matter with a diameter less than or equal to 2.5 μm (PM2.5) on children's asthma development in an urban pregnancy cohort.Methods: Analyses included 736 full-term (≥37 wk) children. Each mother's daily PM2.5 exposure was estimated over gestation using a validated satellite-based spatiotemporal resolved model. Using distributed lag models, we examined associations between weekly averaged PM2.5 levels over pregnancy and physician-diagnosed asthma in children by age 6 years. Effect modification by sex was also examined.Measurements and Main Results: Most mothers were ethnic minorities (54% Hispanic, 30% black), had 12 or fewer years of education (66%), and did not smoke in pregnancy (80%). In the sample as a whole, distributed lag models adjusting for child age, sex, and maternal factors (education, race and ethnicity, smoking, stress, atopy, prepregnancy obesity) showed that increased PM2.5 exposure levels at 16-25 weeks gestation were significantly associated with early childhood asthma development. An interaction between PM2.5 and sex was significant (P = 0.01) with sex-stratified analyses showing that the association exists only for boys.Conclusions: Higher prenatal PM2.5 exposure at midgestation was associated with asthma development by age 6 years in boys. Methods to better characterize vulnerable windows may provide insight into underlying mechanisms.

AB  - Background: Women in poor urban neighborhoods have high rates of stress and allergic diseases, but whether stress or stress correlates such as depression promote inflammatory and type 2 cytokine responses is unknown.Objective: To examine associations among external stressors, perceived stress, depression, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell cytokine responses of mothers enrolled in the Urban Environment and Childhood Asthma Study and test the hypothesis that stress would be positively associated with type 2 and selected proinflammatory (tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-8) responses.Methods: Questionnaire data from mothers living in 4 inner cities included information about external stress, stress perception, and depression. The external stress domains (interpersonal problems, housing, and neighborhood stress) were combined into a Composite Stressor score. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated ex vivo and cytokine responses to innate, adaptive, and polyclonal immune stimuli were compared with stress and depression scores for 469 of the 606 study participants.Results: There were no significant positive associations between Composite Stressor scores, perceived stress, or depression scores and proinflammatory or type 2 cytokine responses, and these findings were not modified by allergy or asthma status. There were some modest associations with individual stressors and cytokine responses, but no consistent relations were noted. Depression was associated with decreased responses to some stimuli, particularly dust mite.Conclusion: Composite measurements of stressors, perceived stress, or depression were not positively related to proinflammatory or type 2 cytokine responses in these young urban women. These data do not support the hypothesis that these factors promote cytokine responses associated with allergy.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT00114881.

AB  - Background: Asthma is one of the most common chronic childhood diseases. While folic acid supplementation around conception helps prevent neural tube defects, an animal model suggests that it may be a risk factor for respiratory diseases, although epidemiologic studies have had conflicting results. We investigated the timing of folic acid-containing prescription filling during pregnancy and child asthma.Methods: In a retrospective cohort study of 104,428 children, born 1996-2005, and their mothers enrolled in Tennessee Medicaid, we investigated the association of filling folic acid-containing prescriptions during pregnancy and childhood asthma at ages 4.5-6 years. We categorized women into exposure groups based on prescription filling centered around the first trimester: no folic acid prescription exposure, exposure in first trimester only, exposure after first trimester, and exposure in first trimester and beyond. We defined asthma using asthma-specific healthcare visits and medication fills. Using logistic regression models, we investigated the relationship adjusting for potential confounders.Results: Overall 15% of children had asthma. Compared with children born to women with no folic acid prescription exposure, children born to women with exposures in the first trimester only or first trimester and later had increased relative odds of asthma (adjusted odds ratios = 1.2, 95% confidence interval = 1.1, 1.3, and 1.2, 95% confidence interval = 1.2, 1.3); no association was seen in children born to women exposed after the first trimester.Conclusion: Timing of folic acid-containing prescription filling during pregnancy was associated with childhood asthma. Our findings contribute to understanding of the role of prenatal nutritional supplements on child respiratory health.

AB  - Asthma affects 7.1 million children in the United States, disproportionately burdening African American and Latino children. Barriers to asthma control include insufficient patient education and fragmented care. Care coordination represents a compelling approach to improve quality of care and address disparities in asthma. The sites of The Merck Childhood Asthma Network Care Coordination Programs implemented different models of care coordination to suit specific settings—school district, clinic or health care system, and community—and organizational structures. A variety of qualitative data sources were analyzed to determine the role setting played in the manifestation of care coordination at each site. There were inherent strengths and challenges of implementing care coordination in each of the settings, and each site used unique strategies to deliver their programs. The relationship between the lead implementing unit and entities that provided (1) access to the priority population and (2) clinical services to program participants played a critical role in the structure of the programs. The level of support and infrastructure provided by these entities to the lead implementing unit influenced how participants were identified and how asthma care coordinators were integrated into the clinical care team.

AB  - Importance: The association between early exposure to animals and childhood asthma is not clear, and previous studies have yielded contradictory results.Objective: To determine whether exposure to dogs and farm animals confers a risk of asthma.Design, Setting and Participants: In a nationwide cohort study, the association between early exposure to dogs and farm animals and the risk of asthma was evaluated and included all children born in Sweden from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2010 (N = 1 011 051), using registry data on dog and farm registration, asthma medication, diagnosis, and confounders for parents and their children. The association was assessed as the odds ratio (OR) for a current diagnosis of asthma at age 6 years for school-aged children and as the hazard ratio (HR) for incident asthma at ages 1 to 5 years for preschool-aged children. Data were analyzed from January 1, 2007, to September 30, 2012.Exposures: Living with a dog or farm animal.Main Outcomes and Measures: Childhood asthma diagnosis and medication used.Results: Of the 1 011 051 children born during the study period, 376 638 preschool-aged (53 460 [14.2%] exposed to dogs and 1729 [0.5%] exposed to farm animals) and 276 298 school-aged children (22 629 [8.2%] exposed to dogs and 958 [0.3%] exposed to farm animals) were included in the analyses. Of these, 18 799 children (5.0%) in the preschool-aged children's cohort experienced an asthmatic event before baseline, and 28 511 cases of asthma and 906 071 years at risk were recorded during follow-up (incidence rate, 3.1 cases per 1000 years at risk). In the school-aged children's cohort, 11 585 children (4.2%) experienced an asthmatic event during the seventh year of life. Dog exposure during the first year of life was associated with a decreased risk of asthma in school-aged children (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.81-0.93) and in preschool-aged children 3 years or older (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.83-0.99) but not in children younger than 3 years (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00-1.07). Results were comparable when analyzing only first-born children. Farm animal exposure was associated with a reduced risk of asthma in both school-aged children and preschool-aged children (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.31-0.76, and HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.56-0.84), respectively.Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, the data support the hypothesis that exposure to dogs and farm animals during the first year of life reduces the risk of asthma in children at age 6 years. This information might be helpful in decision making for families and physicians on the appropriateness and timing of early animal exposure.

AB  - Medical evidence hints that asymptomatic recruits with a history of childhood asthma, quiescent since their 13th birthday, are still at risk for adverse changes in their clinical status following unfavorable environmental exposures during military deployment or combat. Asthmatic persons, claiming none or few symptoms, may still manifest airflow obstruction and display biomarkers of airway inflammation even when they are relatively asymptomatic and experience few if any respiratory complaints. The occupational medicine model offers a credible foundation for acknowledging the importance of personal susceptibility in the pathogenesis of military-associated asthma. It is appropriate to re-explore the current military standard for recruits with asymptomatic childhood asthma (≥12 months) not prescribed antiasthma medications. Raising the acceptance age for these recruits may be a consideration. Unfortunately, there is no effectual screening test that recognizes such susceptible soldiers at risk for future asthma attacks. Nevertheless, there is general support for evidence-based, scientifically valid medical screening that judges fitness for military service. Screening tests comprising asthma biomarkers and genetic indices may better verify vulnerable soldiers destined to suffer future asthma reactivation.

AB  - Background: Asthma is characterized by airway inflammation, and bronchial airways are particularly susceptible to oxidant-induced tissue damage.Objective: To investigate the effect of dietary antioxidant intake and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) on the risk of childhood asthma according to genotypes susceptible to airway diseases.Methods: This cross-sectional study included 1124 elementary school children aged 7-12 years old. Asthma symptoms and smoking history were measured using the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire. Intake of vitamin A (including retinol and β-carotene), C, and E was measured by a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). GSTP1 polymorphisms were genotyped from peripheral blood samples.Results: ETS was significantly associated with presence of asthma symptoms (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.48; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1.29-4.76) and diagnosis (aOR, 1.91; 95 % CI, 1.19-3.06). Dietary antioxidant intake was not associated with asthma symptoms, although ETS plus low vitamin A intake showed a significant positive association with asthma diagnosis (aOR, 2.23; 95 % CI, 1.10-4.54). Children with AA at nucleotide 1695 in GSTP1 who had been exposed to ETS and a low vitamin A intake have an increased risk of asthma diagnosis (aOR, 4.44; 95 % CI,1.58-12.52) compared with children who had not been exposed to the two risk factors. However, ETS exposure and low vitamin A intake did not significantly increase odds of asthma diagnosis in children with AG or GG genotypes.Conclusion: Low vitamin A intake and ETS exposure may increase oxidative stress and thereby risk for childhood asthma. These relationships may be modified by gene susceptibility alleles of GSTP1.

AB  - Background: Dietary patterns might influence the pathogenesis of asthma in Puerto Ricans, the ethnic group most affected by this disease in the United States.Objective: To examine the association among diet, T-helper cell type 17 cytokines, and asthma in Puerto Rican children.Methods: As part of a case-control study of 678 Puerto Rican children 6 to 14 years old in San Juan, participants completed a 75-item questionnaire on the child's food consumption in the prior week. Foods were aggregated into 7 groups: fruits, vegetables, grains, protein foods, dairy, fats, and sweets. Logistic regression was used to evaluate consumption frequency of each group, plasma T-helper cell type 17 cytokine levels, and asthma. Based on this analysis, a food score (range -2 [unhealthy diet: high consumption of dairy products and sweets, low consumption of vegetables and grains] to +2 [healthy diet: high consumption of grains and vegetables, low consumption of dairy and sweets]) was created to identify dietary patterns.Results: High consumption of grains was associated with lower odds of asthma (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.33-0.82), whereas frequent consumption of dairy products (aOR 1.93, 95% CI 1.32-2.84) or sweets (aOR 1.82, 95% CI 1.08-2.72) was associated with higher odds of asthma. A healthier diet (each 1-point increment in food score) was associated with lower levels of interleukin-17F (β = -1.48 pg/mL, 95% CI -1.78 to -1.20) and with 36% decreased odds of asthma (aOR 0.64, 95% CI 0.53-0.77).Conclusion: A healthy diet, with frequent consumption of vegetables and grains and low consumption of dairy products and sweets, was associated with lower levels of interleulin-17F and decreased odds of childhood asthma in Puerto Ricans.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: Asthma and allergic diseases are among the most prevalent chronic noncommunicable diseases of childhood. Although epidemiologic studies suggest that asthma begins in the preschool years, the lack of firm diagnostic criteria to distinguish children who will wheeze only transiently during early-life lower respiratory illnesses from children who will wheeze persistently and develop asthma prevents pinpointing the time at which disease truly begins. Epigenetic mechanisms link gene regulation to environmental cues and developmental trajectories. This article reviews, the search for epigenetic predictors of asthma and/or allergy that can be identified already at birth and/or in early life.Recent Findings: DNA methylation signatures associated with asthma and/or allergy at birth, and time-dependent DNA methylation signatures associated with allergic disease phenotypes in early life have been identified.Summary: The identification of early epigenetic predictors of allergic diseases points to a potential role of epigenetic mechanisms in regulating the inception of and the susceptibility to these diseases. Predictive signatures to more accurately estimate a child's risk for asthma and allergy may improve childhood asthma diagnosis. Moreover, understanding the biological implications of these signatures may help elucidate novel disease pathways and endotypes.

AB  - Asthma is the most common chronic disease among children. It cannot be prevented but can be controlled. Industrialized countries experience high lifetime asthma prevalence that has increased over recent decades. Asthma has a complex interplay of genetic and environmental triggers. Studies have revealed complex interactions of lung structure and function genes with environmental exposures such as environmental tobacco smoke and vitamin D. Home environmental strategies can reduce asthma morbidity in children but should be tailored to specific allergens. Coupled with education and severity-specific asthma therapy, tailored interventions may be the most effective strategy to manage childhood asthma.

AB  - The challenge of evaluating community asthma management programs is complicated by balancing the emphasis on health outcomes with the need to build community process capacity for conducting and monitoring evidence-based programs. The evaluation of a Georgia Childhood Asthma Management Program, a Healthcare Georgia Foundation-supported initiative for multiple diverse programs and settings, provides an example of an approach and the results that address this challenge. A 'developmental evaluation' approach was applied, using mixed methods of quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis, to assess the progress of community asthma prevention programs in building community within the context of: where the community is starting, community-level systems changes, and the community's progress toward becoming more outcome measurement oriented and evidence based. Initial evaluation efforts revealed extensive mobilization of community assets to manage childhood asthma. However, there were minimal planned efforts to assess health outcomes and systems changes, and the lack of a logic model-based program design linking evidence-based practices to outcomes. Following developmental technical assistance within evaluation efforts, all programs developed logic models, linking practices to outcomes with data collection processes to assess progress toward achieving the selected outcomes. This developmental approach across diverse projects and communities, along with a quality improvement benchmarking approach to outcomes, created a focus on health status outcome improvement. Specifically, this approach complemented an emphasis on an improved community process capacity to identify, implement, and monitor evidence-based asthma practices that could be used within each community setting.

AB  - Asthma is one of the most common diseases in the world, resulting in a substantial burden of disease. Although rates of deaths due to asthma worldwide have reduced greatly over the past 25 years, no available therapeutic regimens can cure asthma, and the burden of asthma will continue to be driven by increasing prevalence. The reasons for the increase in asthma prevalence have not been defined, which limits the opportunities to develop targeted primary prevention measures. Although associations are reported between a wide range of risk factors and childhood asthma, substantiation of causality is inherently difficult from observational studies, and few risk factors have been assessed in primary prevention studies. Furthermore, none of the primary prevention intervention strategies that have undergone scrutiny in randomised controlled trials has provided sufficient evidence to lead to widespread implementation in clinical practice. A better understanding of the factors that cause asthma is urgently needed, and this knowledge could be used to develop public health and pharmacological primary prevention measures that are effective in reducing the prevalence of asthma worldwide. To achieve this it will be necessary to think outside the box, not only in terms of risk factors for the causation of asthma, but also the types of novel primary prevention strategies that are developed, and the research methods used to provide the evidence base for their implementation. In the interim, public health efforts should remain focused on measures with the potential to improve lung and general health, such as: reducing tobacco smoking and environmental tobacco smoke exposure; reducing indoor and outdoor air pollution and occupational exposures; reducing childhood obesity and encouraging a diet high in vegetables and fruit; improving feto-maternal health; encouraging breastfeeding; promoting childhood vaccinations; and reducing social inequalities.

AB  - Background: Tobacco smoke exposure has been associated with early childhood asthma symptoms. We assessed the associations of tobacco smoke exposure during pregnancy and childhood with wheezing patterns, asthma, airway interrupter resistance (Rint), and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (Feno) in school-age children and whether birth characteristics explained the associations.Methods: This study was embedded in a population-based prospective cohort study among 6,007 children. Paternal and maternal smoking during pregnancy (never, first trimester only, continued), secondhand tobacco smoke exposure during childhood, wheezing patterns, and asthma were prospectively assessed by questionnaires. Wheezing patterns were defined as never, early (≤ 3 years only), late (> 3 years only), and persistent (≤ 3 and > 3 years) wheezing. Rint and Feno were measured at age 6 years. Birth characteristics were available from registries.Results: Continued maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with increased risks of early and persistent wheezing (OR: 1.24 [1.01, 1.52]; 1.48 [1.13, 1.95]) and asthma (1.65 [1.07, 2.55], for at least five cigarettes per day), but not with Rint or Feno. Birth characteristics did not explain these associations. Childhood tobacco smoke exposure was associated with higher Rint (difference z score: 0.45 [0.00, 0.90]), but this effect attenuated after adjustment for birth characteristics. Maternal smoking during first trimester only or paternal smoking during pregnancy was not associated with Rint, Feno, wheezing, or asthma.Conclusions: Continued maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with increased risks of asthma outcomes in school-age children, whereas childhood tobacco smoke exposure was associated with higher Rint. Birth characteristics may explain part of these associations.

AB  - Asthma represents the most common chronic respiratory disease of childhood. Its current standard diagnosis relies on patient history of symptoms and confirmed expiratory airflow limitation. Nevertheless, the spectrum of asthma in clinical presentation is broad, and both symptoms and lung function may not always reflect the underlying airway inflammation, which can be determined by different pathogenetic mechanisms. For these reasons, the identification of objective biomarkers of asthma, which may guide diagnosis, phenotyping, management and treatment is of great clinical utility and might have a role in the development of personalized therapy. The availability of non-invasive methods to study and monitor disease inflammation is of relevance especially in childhood asthma. In this sense, a promising role might be played by the measurement of exhaled biomarkers, such as exhaled nitric oxide (FE(NO)) and molecules in exhaled breath condensate (EBC). Furthermore, recent studies have shown encouraging results with the application of the novel metabolomic approach to the study of exhaled biomarkers. In this paper the existing knowledge in the field of asthma biomarkers, with a special focus on exhaled biomarkers, will be highlighted.

AB  - Despite fundamental advances in the research on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) since its initial identification almost 60 years ago, recurring failures in developing vaccines and pharmacologic strategies effective in controlling the infection have allowed RSV to become a leading cause of global infant morbidity and mortality. Indeed, the burden of this infection on families and health care organizations worldwide continues to escalate and its financial costs are growing. Furthermore, strong epidemiologic evidence indicates that early-life lower respiratory tract infections caused by RSV lead to the development of recurrent wheezing and childhood asthma. While some progress has been made in the identification of reliable biomarkers for RSV bronchiolitis, a "one size fits all" biomarker capable of accurately and consistently predicting disease severity and post-acute outcomes has yet to be discovered. Therefore, it is of great importance on a global scale to identify useful biomarkers for this infection that will allow pediatricians to cost-effectively predict the clinical course of the disease, as well as monitor the efficacy of new therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Aim: Being overweight has been associated with the risk of developing childhood asthma, but studies have produced conflicting results, for example with regard to possible links to allergic diseases. This study aimed to explore the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and school-age asthma.Methods: Data were obtained from a prospective, longitudinal study of 5044 children born in western Sweden. The parents answered questionnaires at six months and one, four-and-a-half and eight years of age. The response rate to the final questionnaire at the age of eight was just over 80%. BMI was adjusted for age and gender, and a high BMI was defined as the 85th percentile and above.Results: A multivariate analysis showed an independently increased risk of doctor-diagnosed asthma among children with a persistently high BMI, both in infancy and at school age, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 2.9 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.3-6.4. In addition, persistently high BMI was associated with an increased risk of atopic asthma (aOR 4.7, 95% CI 2.0-11.0).Conclusion: A persistently high BMI during childhood increased the risk of doctor-diagnosed asthma at school age. The increased risk of atopic asthma suggests an effect mediated via the immune system.

AB  - Aim: The relationship between airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) and atopy has been previously investigated, but there are still some issues to be clarified. The aim of this study was to assess the link between AHR and mannitol and atopy in asthmatic children.Methods: We evaluated 44 children with asthma, aged 6-16 years of age, using skin prick tests (SPTs), serum total and specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels and the mannitol challenge test (MCT).Results: We found a good correlation between AHR to mannitol and specific IgE against Dermatophagoides pteronissinus (r = -0.66, p < 0.001) and a weak correlation with specific IgE against dog dander (r = -0.33, p = 0.01) and Aspergillus fumigatus (r = -0.23, p = 0.02). Furthermore, we found a weak correlation between AHR to mannitol and serum total IgE (r = -0.30; p = 0.03), the sum of specific IgE to aeroallergens (r = -0.37, p = 0.01) and the number of positive SPTs (r = -0.31, p = 0.02).Conclusion: Measuring AHR with MCT might provide an accurate evaluation of the degree of atopy in children. The patients with a higher degree of atopy were significantly more reactive to mannitol. In clinical practice, these results indicate that children with asthma who are more atopic may require more intensive treatment strategies to reduce AHR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the significant burden of childhood asthma, little is known about prevention-oriented management before and after hospitalizations for asthma exacerbation. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the proportion and characteristics of children admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for asthma exacerbation and the frequency of guideline-recommended outpatient management before and after the hospitalization. METHODS: A 14-center medical record review study of children aged 2 to 17 years hospitalized for asthma exacerbation during 2012-2013. Primary outcome was admission to the ICU; secondary outcomes were 2 preventive factors: inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use and evaluation by asthma specialists in the pre- and posthospitalization periods. RESULTS: Among 385 children hospitalized for asthma, 130 (34%) were admitted to the ICU. Risk factors for ICU admission were female sex, having public insurance, a marker of chronic asthma severity (ICS use), and no prior evaluation by an asthma specialist. Among children with ICU admission, guideline-recommended outpatient management was suboptimal (eg, 65% were taking ICSs at the time of index hospitalization, and 19% had evidence of a prior evaluation by specialist). At hospital discharge, among children with ICU admission who had not previously used controller medications, 85% were prescribed ICSs. Furthermore, 62% of all children with ICU admission were referred to an asthma specialist during the 3-month posthospitalization period. CONCLUSION: In this multicenter study of US children hospitalized with asthma exacerbation, one-third of children were admitted to the ICU. In this high-risk group, we observed suboptimal pre- and posthospitalization asthma care. These findings underscore the importance of continued efforts to improve prevention-oriented asthma care at all clinical encounters.

AB  - Findings from the Toronto Child Health Evaluation Questionnaire (TCHEQ) study indicate that early childhood exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) is related to the onset of atopic childhood asthma. To test this hypothesis further, we investigated whether spatial patterns in the birth neighbourhood of TCHEQ subjects with atopic asthma (136 of 909 schoolchildren in grades 1-2) could be explained by TRAP and other risk factors. If a causal relationship exists between early childhood residential exposure to TRAP and the development of atopic asthma, we hypothesise that (1) clusters of current asthma should exist around the place of residence at birth, and (2) accounting for residential concentrations of TRAP at birth should explain some of the autocorrelation. Several high asthma clusters were observed. Adjusting for TRAP completely explained one cluster; elsewhere, clusters were only partially explained by TRAP. Findings suggest that exposure during early childhood to TRAP in Toronto is an important contributor to the development of the atopic asthma phenotype and reveal the likely importance of other risk factors not measured in the fixed effects of the model.

AB  - There is a lack of asthma research in Belarus, with no investigation of temporal trends. The purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of asthma and related conditions comparing urban and rural children while investigating temporal changes in the region of Grodno, Belarus. A repeated cross-sectional survey design was used. Parents completed surveys on behalf of the child. Data collection was based on the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Children (ISAAC) survey and included 5020 urban and rural children aged 7–15 years in 2009–2010 and 4953 children in 2014 from the Grodno Region. Asthma prevalence in 2009 was 1.4% compared with 1.8% in 2014, whereas spastic bronchitis prevalence was higher (2009: 6.8%; 2014: 8.5%). After adjustment for confounders, rural dwelling showed a statistically significant inverse association with each of the allergic conditions or symptoms. However, asthma (odds ratio [OR] = 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.69–1.50) was not associated with rural dwelling. A diagnosis of asthma was more likely in 2014 compared with 2009 (OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.05–2.33), as was spastic bronchitis (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.06–1.51). Maternal smoking was associated with the presence of respiratory symptoms. The data showed that the prevalence of diagnosed asthma was comparable between urban and rural areas but lower than other regions, there was generally an increase in the prevalence of asthma and related conditions, and that temporal changes did not vary by urban-rural status. The prevalence of spastic bronchitis was over 3 times higher than that of asthma. These findings also suggest that the presence of undiagnosed asthma in children is occurring in the Grodno Region.

AB  - Background: Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are recommended for children with moderate or severe persistent asthma. The aims of this paper were to determine changes in childhood asthma management rates between 2004-14, and to examine current medication use and level of control in children attending general practice.Methods: National BEACH data were used to investigate childhood (<15 years) asthma management rate. Prevalence, medication use and asthma control (Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines) were recorded for a subset of children.Results: The management rate did not change over time. Prevalence was 13.7%. ICS were taken by 42.8% of children. Asthma was well controlled for 51.8%, partly controlled for 30.4% and uncontrolled for 17.9% of children. This study highlights the need to monitor appropriate medication use, particularly ICS/long-acting β-agonist use, for asthma control in children.

AB  - Most studies of childhood asthma management use data from a single family reporter and fail to capture the parent-child dyadic influences. In this descriptive exploratory study with 183 parent-child dyads, data were collected from both parents and children. Using structural equation modeling, the relationships of parents' and children's asthma knowledge, self-efficacy to manage asthma, and asthma management on the child's quality of life were examined. Direct significant relationships from knowledge to self-efficacy to asthma management were found for each member of the dyad. The associations between parents' and children's self-efficacy and asthma management were not statistically significant. Only the children's self-efficacy to manage asthma was significantly associated with children's asthma-related quality of life.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between race and Hispanic ethnicity, maternal and child nativity, country of origin and asthma among 2,558 non-Hispanic white and Hispanic children across 65 Los Angeles neighborhoods. A series of two-level multilevel models were estimated to examine the independent effects of race, ethnicity, and country of origin on childhood asthma. Lifetime asthma prevalence was reported among 9 % of children, with no significant differences between Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites overall. However, in fully adjusted models, Hispanic children of non-Mexican origin reported higher odds of asthma compared to non-Hispanic white children. A protective nativity effect was also observed among children of foreign born mothers compared to US born mothers. Our study provides evidence in support of the heterogeneity of childhood asthma by Hispanic ethnicity and maternal nativity. These findings suggest moving beyond solely considering racial/ethnic classifications which could mask subgroups at increased risk of childhood asthma.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Community pharmacies may be positioned for an increased role in population health. We sought to develop a population-level measure of asthma medication fills and assess its relationship to asthma-related utilization. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, ecological study (2010-2012). Medication data from a chain of pharmacies (n = 27) within 1 county were used to calculate a Pharmacy-level Asthma Medication Ratio (Ph-AMR), defined as controller fills divided by controller plus rescue fills. Higher values are superior because they indicate more controller compared with rescue fills. The outcome was the asthma-related utilization rate among children in the same census tract as the pharmacy, calculated by dividing all emergency visits and hospitalizations by the number of children in that tract. Covariates, including ecological measures of poverty and access to care, were used in multivariable linear regression. RESULTS: Overall, 35 467 medications were filled. The median Ph-AMR was 0.53 (range 0.38-0.66). The median utilization rate across included census tracts was 22.4 visits per 1000 child-years (range 1.3-60.9). Tracts with Ph-AMR <0.5 had significantly higher utilization rates than those with Ph-AMR ≥0.5 (26.1 vs 9.9; P = .001). For every 0.1 increase in Ph-AMR, utilization rates decreased by 9.5 (P = .03), after adjustment for underlying poverty and access. Seasonal variation in fills was evident, but pharmacies in high-utilizing tracts filled more rescue than controller medications at nearly every point during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Ph-AMR was independently associated with ecological childhood asthma morbidity. Pharmacies may be a community-based leverage point for improving population-level asthma control through targeted interventions.

AB  - Background: Current data concerning maternal paracetamol intake during pregnancy, or intake during infancy and risk of wheezing or asthma in childhood is inconclusive based on epidemiological studies. We have investigated whether there is a causal link between maternal paracetamol intake during pregnancy and lactation and the development of house dust mite (HDM) induced allergic airways disease (AAD) in offspring using a neonatal mouse model.Methods: Pregnant mice were administered paracetamol or saline by oral gavage from the day of mating throughout pregnancy and/or lactation. Subsequently, their pups were exposed to intranasal HDM or saline from day 3 of life for up to 6 weeks. Assessments of airway hyper-responsiveness, inflammation and remodelling were made at weaning (3 weeks) and 6 weeks of age.Results: Maternal paracetamol exposure either during pregnancy and/or lactation did not affect development of AAD in offspring at weaning or at 6 weeks. There were no effects of maternal paracetamol at any time point on airway remodelling or IgE levels.Conclusions: Maternal paracetamol did not enhance HDM induced AAD in offspring. Our mechanistic data do not support the hypothesis that prenatal paracetamol exposure increases the risk of childhood asthma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous studies suggest that psychosocial factors could contribute to pediatric asthma. OBJECTIVE: To examine the relation between single and cumulative adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), a measurement of household dysfunction, on parent report of lifetime asthma in children. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data from the 2011 to 2012 National Survey of Children's Health, a nationally representative sample of children 0 to 17 years old (n = 92,472). The main exposure was parent or guardian report of 6 ACE exposures (eg, witnessing domestic violence). The relation between ACE exposures and parent-reported diagnosis of childhood asthma was examined using multivariable logistic regression after controlling for demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral covariates. RESULTS: Overall asthma prevalence was 14.6%. Exposure prevalence to any ACE was 29.2%. Increased number of ACE exposures was associated with increased odds of asthma. In the adjusted model, the odds of reporting asthma were 1.28 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-1.43) for those reporting 1 ACE, 1.73 (95% CI 1.27-2.36) for those with 4 ACEs, and 1.61 (95% CI 1.15-2.26) for those with 5 or 6 ACEs compared with those with no ACE exposures. Effects were moderated by Hispanic ethnicity. Hispanic children exposed to 4 ACEs had a 4.46 times increase in lifetime asthma (95% CI 2.46-8.08); white children had a 1.19 times increase (95% CI 0.80-1.79) compared with those exposed to 0 ACE. CONCLUSION: This study supports the growing evidence for the biopsychosocial model of asthma onset. Future studies should examine the association between ACEs and specific asthma-related health outcomes.

AB  - Background Previous observational studies have claimed that birth weight and childhood wheezing disorders are associated although the results remained inconsistent. One systematic review and two systematic reviews that included meta-analyses reported inconsistent results. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate this. Methods An online search of published papers linking childhood asthma and wheezing disorders with birth weight up to February 2014 was carried out using EMBASE and Medline medical research databases. Summary ORs were estimated using random-effects models. Subgroup meta-analyses were performed to assess the robustness of risk associations and between-study heterogeneity. Results A total of 37 studies comprising 1 712 737 participants were included in our meta-analysis. The unadjusted summary ORs for risk of childhood wheezing disorders associated with low birth weight (<2.5 kg) were 1.60 (95% CI 1.39 to 1.85, p<0.001) and 1.37 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.79, p=0.02) when compared with >2.5 and 2.5-4.0 kg birthweight groups, respectively. The overall summary OR for high birth weight (>4 kg) as compared to the 2.5-4.0 kg birthweight group was 1.02 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.04, p=0.13). There was substantial heterogeneity in the unadjusted low birth weight risk estimates which was not accounted for by predefined study characteristics. There was no significant heterogeneity in the high birth weight risk estimates. There was some evidence of funnel plot asymmetry and small study effects in the low birth weight (2.5 vs >2.5 kg and <2.5 vs 2.5-4 kg) OR estimates. Conclusions Our results suggest that low birth (<2.5 kg) is an independent risk factor for wheezing disorders during childhood and adolescence although there was substantial heterogeneity among the risk estimates. However, we found no significant association of high birth weight with wheezing disorders.

AB  - Objective. To evaluate the evidence on the immunomodulatory effect of acupoint application for childhood asthma. Methods. Five electronic databases through October 2014 were searched. The risk of bias in eligible studies was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. Standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of random-effects model were calculated. And heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran Q statistic and quantified with the I2 index. Results. Six studies were included in our review. The aggregated results suggested that acupoint application showed the beneficial effect for childhood asthma in improving IgA (SMD, −0.83; 95% CI −1.14 to −0.52; P<0.00001), IgE (SMD, −0.52; 95% CI −0.76 to −0.29; P<0.001), IgG (SMD, −1.17; 95% CI −1.61 to −0.74; P<0.0001), IL-4 (SMD, −0.57; 95% CI −0.91 to −0.23; P=0.0009), and IFN-γ (SMD, −0.38; 95% CI −0.71 to −0.04; P=0.03) but not IgM (SMD, −0.40; 95% CI −0.98 to 0.18; P=0.18). And the effective dose of acupoint application may be 2–6 hours/time and a total of 3 times within 4 weeks. Conclusions. This review showed the positive evidence that acupoint application had the favorable immunomodulatory effect for childhood asthma. However, more studies with long follow-up are warrant to confirm the current findings.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: There has been recent interest in understanding the origins of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Epidemiological studies suggest that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease clearly has other causes apart from tobacco smoke.Recent Findings: Cross-sectional studies of adult cohorts with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease highlight that childhood asthma is a risk factor. A recent longitudinal childhood cohort study of children from childhood to the age of 50 years describes that children with severe asthma are at increased risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and that the deficit in lung function can be tracked back to early years.Summary: Children with severe asthma are at increased risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: Wheezing is a common symptom in early childhood but only some of these children will experience continued wheezing symptoms in later childhood making the diagnosis and treatment of these children challenging. This review covers recent findings regarding the epidemiology, diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of preschool-aged children with asthma.Recent Findings: Key characteristics that distinguish the childhood asthma-predictive phenotype include male sex, history of wheezing with lower respiratory tract infections, history of parental asthma, history of atopic dermatitis, eosinophilia, early sensitization to food or aeroallergens, or lower lung function in early life. The preschool-aged asthma population tends to be characterized as exacerbation prone with relatively limited impairment. The diagnosis of asthma in preschool-aged children is often based on symptom patterns, presence of risk factors, and therapeutic responses. Asthma management includes intermittent and daily inhaled corticosteroids, daily leukotriene-receptor antagonists, and, in rare cases, combination therapies.Summary: The diagnosis of asthma in preschool-aged children is based on symptom patterns and the presence of risk factors, and the goals of asthma management are achieved through a partnership between the family and the healthcare team using regular assessment of symptom control and response to daily controller therapy.

AB  - Background/objectives: Consumption of oily fish more than once per week has been shown to improve cognitive outcomes in children. However, it is unknown whether similar benefits can be achieved by long-term omega-3 fatty acid supplementation. The objective was to investigate the effect of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation during the first 5 years of life on subsequent academic performance in children by conducting a secondary analysis of the CAPS (Childhood Asthma Prevention Study).Subjects/methods: A total of 616 infants with a family history of asthma were randomised to receive tuna fish oil (high in long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, active) or Sunola oil (low in omega-3 fatty acids, control) from the time breastfeeding ceased or at the age of 6 months until the age of 5 years. Academic performance was measured by a nationally standardised assessment of literacy and numeracy (National Assessment Program Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN)) in school years 3, 5, 7 and 9. Plasma omega-3 fatty acid levels were measured at regular intervals until 8 years of age. Between-group differences in test scores, adjusted for maternal age, birth weight and maternal education, were estimated using mixed-model regression.Results: Among 239 children, there were no significant differences in NAPLAN scores between active and control groups. However, at 8 years, the proportion of omega-3 fatty acid in plasma was positively associated with the NAPLAN score (0.13 s.d. unit increase in score per 1% absolute increase in plasma omega-3 fatty acid (95% CI 0.03, 0.23)).Conclusions: Our findings do not support the practice of supplementing omega-3 fatty acids in the diet of young children to improve academic outcomes. Further exploration is needed to understand the association between plasma omega-3 fatty acid levels at 8 years and academic performance.

AB  - Introduction The prevalence of asthma has been rising, particularly in younger age groups. In the 12-month period from February 2012 there were 28 deaths due to asthma in children under 18 in the United Kingdom, the majority of which were preventable. The purpose of this audit was to determine how effective our Emergency Department is at managing children presenting with acute asthma. Method We undertook a retrospective audit of 50 consecutive presentations to Huddersfield Royal Infirmary Emergency Department between 1 August 2013 and 31 March 2014 that met the inclusion criteria. Whether each patient had initial vital signs, timely initial management, vital signs after initial management, and appropriate further management were audited. Results The majority of patients were male; mean age was 8.5 years. There were deficiencies in measurements for systolic blood pressure (14%), conscious level (30%), and peak flow (46%). Most patients received the correct dose of β 2 agonist (96%) and oral or IV steroid (82%). Approximately 50% had further vital signs recorded. Thirty-six per cent were discharged with the correct dose of prednisolone. Conclusion Certain aspects of the management of childhood asthma are being overlooked. We have suggested an improved integrated care pathway that we feel will improve the deficiencies highlighted.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: It has been suggested that maternal depression during pregnancy is associated with asthma in the offspring, but the role of medical treatment of depression is not known. Our goal was to examine whether prenatal antidepressant use increases the risk of asthma in the offspring. METHODS: A cohort study was performed among all live singletons born in Denmark between 1996 and 2007. Mothers who had a diagnosis of depressive disorder and/or who used antidepressants 1 year before or during the index pregnancy were identified. Using a Cox proportional hazards regression model, we estimated the hazard ratio (HR) for asthma in the offspring after antidepressant use during pregnancy. RESULTS: Of the 733 685 children identified, 84 683 had a diagnosis of asthma. A total of 21 371 children were exposed to prenatal maternal depression (ie, a diagnosis of depressive disorder or use of antidepressants 1 year before or during pregnancy). Prenatal maternal depression was associated with childhood asthma (HR: 1.25 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20-1.30]). Overall, 8895 children were exposed to antidepressants in utero. Compared with children born to mothers with prenatal depression and no antidepressant use during pregnancy, the HR for asthma after any antidepressant use during pregnancy was 1.00 (95% CI: 0.93-1.08). HRs after use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors only, newer antidepressants only, and older antidepressants only were 0.95 (95% CI: 0.88-1.03), 1.11 (95% CI: 0.89-1.39), and 1.26 (95% CI: 1.02-1.55), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Antidepressant use during pregnancy generally did not increase the risk of asthma. Only use of older antidepressants was associated with an increased risk of asthma.

AB  - RATIONALE: The early hygiene hypothesis explained the development of allergies by a lack of infections; nowadays, the aspect of excessive cleanliness in affluent populations seems to have replaced this concept. Yet, no investigation has shown that home or personal cleanliness relate to allergic diseases. OBJECTIVES: To relate personal and home cleanliness to risk of asthma and allergies. METHODS: Comprehensive questionnaire information on home or personal cleanliness and allergic health conditions at school age was collected in 399 participants of the urban Perinatale Asthma Umwelt Langzeit Allergie Studie (PAULA) birth cohort. Bacterial markers were assessed in floor and mattress dust and were related to cleanliness and allergic diseases. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Personal cleanliness was inversely related to bacterial compounds on floors and mattresses, whereas home cleanliness effectively reduced dust amount but not microbial markers. Exposure to muramic acid related to a lower prevalence of school-age asthma (adjusted odds ratio, 0.59 [95% confidence interval, 0.39; 0.90]). Mattress endotoxin in the first year of life was inversely associated with atopic sensitization (0.73 [0.56-0.96]) and asthma at school age (0.72 [0.55-0.95]). Despite the associations of dust parameters both with cleanliness and allergic health conditions, the development of allergies was not related to home and personal cleanliness. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial exposure in house dust determined childhood asthma and allergies. Personal cleanliness, such as washing hands, and home cleanliness were objectively reflected by dust parameters in homes. However, neither personal nor home cleanliness was associated with a risk for asthma and allergies. Other microbial components in house dust not affected by personal hygiene are likely to play a role.

AB  - Asthma prevalence is reportedly low for children of Mexican descent compared with other ethnic groups and Latino subgroups. The results of our exploratory ethnographic research among children of farmworkers in California dramatically suggest otherwise. Unstructured and semi-structured open-ended interviews and photovoice methods were combined to explore the lived experiences of members of a marginalized farmworker community. This research gives voice to a population of families living in the highly toxic, yet agriculturally wealthy environment of the San Joaquin Valley. Little work has been reported employing photovoice, a community-based participatory research method, to study childhood exposure to pesticides. A rich narrative about perceptions of pesticide exposure emerged from the ethnographic interviews. Thematic analysis yielded beliefs about the relationship between air quality and childhood asthma. The findings suggest that childhood asthma should be reviewed within the context of local levels of environmental exposure and the principles of environmental justice.

AB  - Childhood asthma is a common chronic condition. Approximately five percent of all children in western countries are prescribed treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to prevent asthma symptoms. Current guidelines advocate titrating ICS dose to symptoms but this approach is not without problem, e.g. how to discern asthmatic from non-asthmatic symptoms? And when to reduce ICS dose? This review describes the strengths and weaknesses of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) as an objective index for individualising asthma control in children. Epidemiological and mechanistic evidence suggest that FENO should be a promising biomarker for eosinophilic airway inflammation (a hall mark for asthma) but somewhat surprisingly, clinical trials in children have not consistently found benefit from adding FENO to a symptom-based approach to ICS treatment in children. There are a number of reasons why FENO has apparently failed to translate from promising biomarker to clinically useful tool, and one reason may be a lack of understanding of what merits a significant intrasubject change in FENO. This review describes the rise and apparent fall of FENO as biomarker for asthma and then focuses on more recent evidence which suggest that FENO may prove to have a role in the management of childhood asthma, and in particular preventing exacerbations.

AB  - Childhood asthma prevalence worldwide has been increasing markedly over several decades. Various theories have been proposed to account for this alarming trend. The disease has a broad spectrum of potential determinants ranging from genetics to lifestyle and environmental factors. Epidemiological observations have demonstrated that several important lifestyle and environmental factors including obesity, urban living, dietary patterns such as food low in antioxidants and fast food, non-breastfeeding, gut flora imbalance, cigarette smoking, air pollution, and viral infection are associated with asthma exacerbations in children. However, only environmental tobacco smoke has been associated with the development of asthma. Despite epidemiological studies indicating that many other factors are probably associated with the development of asthma, the relationships are not considered causal due to the inadequate evidence and inconsistent results from recent studies. This may highlight that sufficient data and exact mechanisms of causality are still in need of further study.

AB  - Background The debate about whether energy consumed in liquid form is more obesogenic than energy consumed in solid form remains equivocal. We aimed to evaluate the effects of liquid versus solid energy intake and different beverage types on changes in childhood adiposity. Methods Our analyses included 8-year-old Australian children ( n = 158) participating in the Childhood Asthma Prevention Study. Dietary information was collected using three 24-h recalls at age 9 years. Multivariate linear regression was used to evaluate the effects of liquid versus solid energy intake and different beverage types on changes in body mass index ( BMI) Z-score from ages 8 to 11.5 years (△ BMI z8-11.5y) and percentage body fat (%BF) at age 11.5 years (% BF11.5y). Substitution models were used to evaluate the effects of substituting other beverage types for sugar-sweetened beverages ( SSB). Results Liquid energy intake (1 MJ day-1) was more closely associated with both △ BMI z8-11.5y (β = 0.23, P = 0.02) and % BF11.5y (β = 2.31%, P = 0.01) than solid energy intake (△ BMI z8-11.5y: β = 0.12, P = 0.01 and % BF11.5y: β = 0.80%, P = 0.07). SSB consumption (100 g day-1) was directly associated with △ BMI z8-11.5y (β = 0.08, P = 0.02) and % BF11.5y (β = 0.92%, P = 0.004),whereas diet drinks (100 g day-1) were inversely associated with △ BMI z8-11.5y (β = 0.18, P = 0.02). Substitution of 100 g of SSB by 100 g of water or diet drink, but not other beverages, was inversely associated with both △ BMI z8-11.5y and % BF11.5y ( P < 0.01). Conclusions Our findings indicate that liquid energy is more obesogenic than solid energy. In particular, SSB, but not other beverage types, are a significant predictor of childhood adiposity and replacing SSB with water can have long-term beneficial effects on childhood adiposity.

AB  - Background: Little is known about the differential impact of combinations of parental smoking behavior (indoor or outdoor smoking, or not smoking) on preventing childhood asthma. Our objective was to examine the association between parental smoking behavior and children's asthma.Methods: A nationally representative population-based birth cohort of 40,580 babies, aged 0.5 years in 2001 (response rate, 87.8%), was studied to estimate adjusted odds ratios of combinations of maternal and paternal indoor or outdoor smoking at home for physician visits and hospitalization for childhood asthma up to 8-years-old, and population attributable fractions.Results: Odds of hospitalization for asthma among children whose father alone smokes indoors at home did not largely increase (up to 20%). However, if the mother also smokes indoors at home, the odds strongly increased. After adjusting for demographic, perinatal and socioeconomic factors, the increase in odds for children whose father and mother both smoke indoors compared to children with non-smoking parents was 54% (95% confidence interval: 21-96%), 43% (8-90%) and 72% (22-143%) for children aged 0.5<-2.5, 2.5<-4.5 and 4.5<-8 years-old, respectively. The odds ratios of smoking outdoors did not largely differ from those of smoking indoors. Our estimation of population attributable fractions revealed that if all parents in Japan quit smoking, hospitalization of children for asthma could be reduced by 8.3% (2.2-14.3%), 9.3% (0.9-17.6%) and 18.2% (7.7-28.8%), respectively.Conclusions: Parental indoor smoking at home increased and exacerbated children's asthma. Smoking at home, whether it is indoors or outdoors, may increase the risks for asthma attacks of their children.

AB  - Inhaled corticosteroids can prevent acute exacerbations and emergency visits when used as part of a chronic care plan for long-term control of asthma, but low patient adherence and inadequate provider prescribing (clinical inertia) can limit these benefits. State Medicaid programs are a major source of insurance coverage for low-income children, paying for medications and preventive care, as well as bearing the cost of adverse outcomes for common chronic conditions in childhood, such as asthma. This study measured the incidence and timing of emergency department (ED) visits in the first 90 days after an initial inhaled corticosteroid prescription (ICS-Rx) among 43,156 Medicaid-enrolled children with a diagnosis of asthma in 14 southern states in 2007. One in 5 children (19.6%) with asthma had at least 1 ED visit in the first 90 days after initial ICS-Rx; 10% of these visits occurred within the first 48 hours, and 25% occurred within the first week. Continued ICS-Rx use was associated with lower risk of an ED visit. There were no racial differences in the ED visit rates. Initial ICS-Rx for Medicaid-enrolled children is a warning flag for short-term risk of asthma-related ED visits, whereas continued ICS-Rx use is protective for at least 90 days. Primary care follow-up may be needed within the first 2 days after initial ICS-Rx to prevent adverse outcomes. Medicaid programs could use claims data for surveillance of adherence to guideline-concordant therapy and for sentinel events marking windows of a higher risk for ED visits.

AB  - A first step in primary disease prevention is identifying common, modifiable risk factors that contribute to a significant proportion of disease development. Infant respiratory viral infection and childhood asthma are the most common acute and chronic diseases of childhood, respectively. Common clinical features and links between these diseases have long been recognized, with early-life respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (RV) lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) being strongly associated with increased asthma risk. However, there has long been debate over the role of these respiratory viruses in asthma inception. In this article, we systematically review the evidence linking early-life RSV and RV LRTIs with asthma inception and whether they could therefore be targets for primary prevention efforts.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: While paracetamol exposure in pregnancy and early infancy has been associated with asthma, it remains unclear whether this is confounded by respiratory tract infections, which have been suggested as an alternative explanation. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies that reported the association between paracetamol exposure during pregnancy or infancy and the subsequent development of childhood asthma (>=5years). METHODS: Two independent researchers searched the databases EMBASE and PUBMED on 12 August 2013 for relevant articles using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Study quality was assessed and results were pooled using fixed effect models or random effect models when moderate between-study heterogeneity was observed. We explicitly assessed whether the observed associations are due to confounding by respiratory tract infections. RESULTS: Eleven observational cohort studies met the inclusion criteria. Any paracetamol use during the first trimester was related to increased risk of childhood asthma (5 studies, pooled OR=1.39, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.91) but there was marked between-study heterogeneity (I(2)=63%) and only one of these studies adjusted for maternal respiratory tract infections. Increasing frequency of use of paracetamol during infancy was associated with increased odds of childhood asthma (3 studies, pooled OR=1.15, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.31 per doubling of days exposure), but in these same three studies adjusting for respiratory tract infections reduced this association (OR=1.06, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.22). DISCUSSION: The association during early pregnancy exposure was highly variable between studies and exposure during infancy appears to be moderately confounded by respiratory tract infections. There is insufficient evidence to warrant changing guidelines on early life paracetamol exposure at this time.

AB  - Background: To evaluate the association between maternal socioeconomic status (SES) during pregnancy and asthma among offspring.Methods: A retrospective observational hospital-based birth cohort study in a university-based Obstetrics and Gynecology department in Finland. A total of 40 118 women with singleton live births between 1989 and 2007 were linked with data from the register for asthma medication for their offspring (n = 2518). Pregnancy and maternal SES factors were recorded during pregnancy and labor. SES was categorized thus: upper white-collar workers (highest SES), lower white-collar workers, blue-collar workers, others (lowest SES) and cases with missing information. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association between maternal SES and childhood asthma.Results: We found no convincing evidence of a direct association between maternal SES and childhood asthma. Parental smoking was the clearest factor affecting asthma among children of lower white-collar workers. Differences in pregnancy and delivery characteristics were observed between the SES groups.Conclusions: Maternal socioeconomic status had no significant direct impact on the prevalence of asthma in this Finnish birth cohort. Finnish public health services appeared to offer equal quality services independently of SES.Trial Registration: The study is registered in Kuopio University Hospital register (TUTKI): ID 5302448 .

AB  - Background: As part of an investigation into the respiratory health in children conducted in Torino, northwestern Italy, our aim was to assess development in lung function from childhood to adolescence, and to assess changes or persistence of asthma symptoms on the change of lung function parameters. Furthermore, the observed lung function data were compared with the Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI) reference values.Methods: We conducted a longitudinal study, which lasted 7 years, composed by first survey of 4-5 year-old children in 2003 and a follow-up in 2010. Both surveys consisted in collecting information on health by standardized SIDRIA questionnaire and spirometry testing with FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC% and FEF25-75 measurements.Results: 242 subjects successfully completed both surveys. In terms of asthma symptoms (AS = asthma attacks or wheezing in the previous 12 months), 191/242 were asymptomatic, 13 reported AS only in the first survey (early transient), 23 had AS only in the second survey (late onset), and 15 had AS in both surveys (persistent). Comparing the lung function parameters observed with the predicted by GLI only small differences were detected, except for FVC and FEF25-75, for which more than 5% of subjects had Z-score values beyond the Z-score normal limits. Furthermore, as well as did not significantly affect developmental changes in FVC and FEV1, the decrease in FEV1/FVC ratio was significantly higher in subjects with AS at the time of follow-up (late onset and persistent phenotypes) while the increase in FEF25-75 was significantly smaller in subjects with persistent AS (p < 0.05).Conclusions: The GLI equations are valid in evaluating lung function during development, at least in terms of lung volume measurements. Findings also suggest that the FEF25-75 may be a useful tool for clinical and epidemiological studies of childhood asthma.

AB  - Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract infection (LRI) during infancy has been consistently associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma. In addition, evidence supports that this relationship is causal. However, the mechanisms through which RSV contributes to asthma development are not understood. The INSPIRE (Infant Susceptibility to Pulmonary Infections and Asthma Following RSV Exposure) study objectives are to: 1) characterize the host phenotypic response to RSV infection in infancy and the risk of recurrent wheeze and asthma, 2) identify the immune response and lung injury patterns of RSV infection that are associated with the development of early childhood wheezing illness and asthma, and 3) determine the contribution of specific RSV strains to early childhood wheezing and asthma development. This article describes the INSPIRE study, including study aims, design, recruitment results, and enrolled population characteristics.Methods/design: The cohort is a population based longitudinal birth cohort of term healthy infants enrolled during the first months of life over a two year period. Respiratory infection surveillance was conducted from November to March of the first year of life, through surveys administered every two weeks. In-person illness visits were conducted if infants met pre-specified criteria for a respiratory illness visit. Infants will be followed annually to ages 3-4 years for assessment of the primary endpoint: wheezing illness. Nasal, urine, stool and blood samples were collected at various time points throughout the study for measurements of host and viral factors that predict wheezing illness. Nested case-control studies will additionally be used to address other primary and secondary hypotheses.Discussion: In the INSPIRE study, 1952 infants (48% female) were enrolled during the two enrollment years and follow-up will continue through 2016. The mean age of enrollment was 60 days. During winter viral season, more than 14,000 surveillance surveys were carried out resulting in 2,103 respiratory illness visits on 1189 infants. First year follow-up has been completed on over 95% percent of participants from the first year of enrollment. With ongoing follow-up for wheezing and childhood asthma outcomes, the INSPIRE study will advance our understanding of the complex causal relationship between RSV infection and early childhood wheezing and asthma.

AB  - Background: Childhood asthma morbidity has been associated with ambient ozone in case-crossover studies. Varying effects of ozone by child age and sex, however, have been less explored.Methods: This study evaluates associations between ozone exposure and asthma emergency department visits and hospitalizations among boys and girls aged 5-17 years in New York City for the 2005-2011 warm season period. Time-stratified case-crossover analysis was conducted and, for comparison, time-series analysis controlling for season, day-of-week, same-day and delayed effects of temperature and relative humidity were also performed.Results: We found associations between ambient ozone levels and childhood asthma emergency department visits and hospitalizations in New York City, although the relationships varied among boys and girls and by age group. For an increase of interquartile range (0.013 ppm) in ozone, there was a 2.9-8.4% increased risk for boys and 5.4-6.5% for girls in asthma emergency department visits; and 8.2% increased risk for girls in hospitalizations. Among girls, we observed stronger associations among older children (10-13 and 14-17 year age groups). We did not observe significant modification by age for boys. Boys exhibited a more prompt response (lag day 1) to ozone than did girls (lag day 3), but significant associations for girls were retained longer, through lag day 6.Conclusions: Our study indicates significant variance in associations between short-term ozone concentrations and asthma events by child sex and age. Differences in ozone response for boys and girls, before and after puberty, may point towards both social (gendered) and biological (sex-linked) sources of effect modification.

AB  - Objective. To evaluate the evidence on the immunomodulatory effect of acupoint application for childhood asthma. Methods. Five electronic databases through October 2014 were searched. The risk of bias in eligible studies was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. Standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of random-effects model were calculated. And heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran Q statistic and quantified with the I² index. Results. Six studies were included in our review. The aggregated results suggested that acupoint application showed the beneficial effect for childhood asthma in improving IgA (SMD, -0.83; 95% CI -1.14 to -0.52; P < 0.00001), IgE (SMD, -0.52; 95% CI -0.76 to -0.29; P < 0.001), IgG (SMD, -1.17; 95% CI -1.61 to -0.74; P < 0.0001), IL-4 (SMD, -0.57; 95% CI -0.91 to -0.23; P = 0.0009), and IFN-γ (SMD, -0.38; 95% CI -0.71 to -0.04; P = 0.03) but not IgM (SMD, -0.40; 95% CI -0.98 to 0.18; P = 0.18). And the effective dose of acupoint application may be 2-6 hours/time and a total of 3 times within 4 weeks. Conclusions. This review showed the positive evidence that acupoint application had the favorable immunomodulatory effect for childhood asthma. However, more studies with long follow-up are warrant to confirm the current findings.

AB  - Background: Airway remodeling is a proposed mechanism that underlies the persistent loss of lung function associated with childhood asthma. Previous studies have demonstrated that human lung fibroblasts (HLFs) co-cultured with primary human bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) from asthmatic children exhibit greater expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) components compared to co-culture with BECs derived from healthy children. Myofibroblasts represent a population of differentiated fibroblasts that have greater synthetic activity. We hypothesized co-culture with asthmatic BECs would lead to greater fibroblast to myofibroblast transition (FMT) compared to co-culture with healthy BECs.Methods: BECs were obtained from well-characterized asthmatic and healthy children and were proliferated and differentiated at an air-liquid interface (ALI). BEC-ALI cultures were co-cultured with HLFs for 96 hours. RT-PCR was performed in HLFs for alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and flow cytometry was used to assay for α-SMA antibody labeling of HLFs. RT-PCR was also preformed for the expression of tropomyosin-I as an additional marker of myofibroblast phenotype. In separate experiments, we investigated the role of TGFβ2 in BEC-HLF co-cultures using monoclonal antibody inhibition.Results: Expression of α-SMA by HLFs alone was greater than by HLFs co-cultured with healthy BECs, but not different than α-SMA expression by HLFs co-cultured with asthmatic BECs. Flow cytometry also revealed significantly less α-SMA expression by healthy co-co-cultures compared to asthmatic co-cultures or HLF alone. Monoclonal antibody inhibition of TGFβ2 led to similar expression of α-SMA between healthy and asthmatic BEC-HLF co-cultures. Expression of topomyosin-I was also significantly increased in HLF co-cultured with asthmatic BECs compared to healthy BEC-HLF co-cultures or HLF cultured alone.Conclusion: These findings suggest dysregulation of FMT in HLF co-cultured with asthmatic as compared to healthy BECs. Our results suggest TGFβ2 may be involved in the differential regulation of FMT by asthmatic BECs. These findings further illustrate the importance of BEC-HLF cross-talk in asthmatic airway remodeling.

AB  - Objective: Studies determining the relationship between serum vitamin D status and childhood asthma have yielded controversial results. Findings indicated that vitamin D deficiency is associated with asthma and airway hyper responsiveness. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between serum vitamin D status and childhood asthma. Methods: Data were obtained from 200 asthmatic children (age 3-12 years) and 200 healthy controls. Serum levels of 25(OH) vitamin D, total IgE, calcium, phosphorus, parathormone (PTH) and eosinophil count were measured in both asthmatic children and healthy controls. Also, the mean values of 25(OH) vitamin D were compared with asthma symptom severities. Findings: There was a significant decrease in the concentration of serum 25(OH) vitamin D in the asthmatic patients as compared with the controls (20.34±2.8 vs 25.39±4.1 ng/mL, 95%CI: 1.46-3.86, P=0.01). Out of total asthmatic subjects, 40 (20%) were vitamin D sufficient, 48 (24%) were insufficient, and 112 (56%) were deficient. Total IgE concentration was also significantly higher in asthmatic patients having vitamin D deficiency (132.4±20.1 IU/ml, 95%CI: 1.38-3.75, P=0.03). Comparing asthmatic patients with healthy controls, odds of having vitamin D level less than 20ng/mL was 2.47. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency may be positively related to the prevalence of asthma in children.

AB  - Rationale and Objectives: Asthma is associated with chronic airflow obstruction. Our goal was to assess the association of computed tomographic measures of airway wall volume and lumen volume with the FEV1 and chronic airflow obstruction in smokers with childhood-onset asthma.Methods: We analyzed clinical, lung function, and volumetric computed tomographic airway volume data from 7,266 smokers, including 590 with childhood-onset asthma. Small wall volume and small lumen volume of segmental airways were defined as measures 1 SD below the mean. We assessed the association between small wall volume, small lumen volume, FEV1, and chronic airflow obstruction (post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio < 0.7) using linear and logistic models.Measurements and Main Results: Compared with subjects without childhood-onset asthma, those with childhood-onset asthma had smaller wall volume and lumen volume (P < 0.0001) of segmental airways. Among subjects with childhood-onset asthma, those with the smallest wall volume and lumen volume had the lowest FEV1 and greatest odds of chronic airflow obstruction. A similar tendency was seen in those without childhood-onset asthma. When comparing these two groups, both small wall volume and small lumen volume were more strongly associated with FEV1 and chronic airflow obstruction among subjects with childhood-asthma in multivariate models.Conclusion: In smokers with childhood-onset asthma, smaller airways are associated with reduced lung function and chronic airflow obstruction. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00608764).

AB  - Childhood asthma and obesity have reached epidemic proportions worldwide, and the latter is also contributing to increasing rates of related metabolic disorders, such as diabetes. However, the relationship between asthma, obesity, and abnormal metabolism is not well understood nor has it been adequately explored in children. This article discusses the concept of metabolic asthma and the recent hypothesis that early derangement in lipid and glucose metabolism is independently associated with increased risk for asthma.

AB  - Background: Childhood asthma and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), both disorders of airway inflammation, were associated in recent observational studies. Although childhood OSA is effectively treated by adenotonsillectomy (AT), it remains unclear whether AT also improves childhood asthma. We hypothesized that AT, the first line of therapy for childhood OSA, would be associated with improved asthma outcomes and would reduce the usage of asthma therapies in children.Methods and Findings: Using the 2003-2010 MarketScan database, we identified 13,506 children with asthma in the United States who underwent AT. Asthma outcomes during 1 y preceding AT were compared to those during 1 y following AT. In addition, 27,012 age-, sex-, and geographically matched children with asthma without AT were included to examine asthma outcomes among children without known adenotonsillar tissue morbidity. Primary outcomes included the occurrence of a diagnostic code for acute asthma exacerbation (AAE) or acute status asthmaticus (ASA). Secondary outcomes included temporal changes in asthma medication prescriptions, the frequency of asthma-related emergency room visits (ARERs), and asthma-related hospitalizations (ARHs). Comparing the year following AT to the year prior, AT was associated with significant reductions in AAE (30.2%; 95% CI: 25.6%-34.3%; p<0.0001), ASA (37.9%; 95% CI: 29.2%-45.6%; p<0.0001), ARERs (25.6%; 95% CI: 16.9%-33.3%; p<0.0001), and ARHs (35.8%; 95% CI: 19.6%-48.7%; p = 0.02). Moreover, AT was associated with significant reductions in most asthma prescription refills, including bronchodilators (16.7%; 95% CI: 16.1%-17.3%; p<0.001), inhaled corticosteroids (21.5%; 95% CI: 20.7%-22.3%; p<0.001), leukotriene receptor antagonists (13.4%; 95% CI: 12.9%-14.0%; p<0.001), and systemic corticosteroids (23.7%; 95% CI: 20.9%-26.5%; p<0.001). In contrast, there were no significant reductions in these outcomes in children with asthma who did not undergo AT over an overlapping follow-up period. Limitations of the MarketScan database include lack of information on race and obesity status. Also, the MarketScan database does not include information on children with public health insurance (i.e., Medicaid) or uninsured children.Conclusions: In a very large sample of privately insured children, AT was associated with significant improvements in several asthma outcomes. Contingent on validation through prospectively designed clinical trials, this study supports the premise that detection and treatment of adenotonsillar tissue morbidity may serve as an important strategy for improving asthma control.

AB  - We sought to compare the accuracy of a newly developed childhood asthma score (CAS) with routine clinical assessment of respiratory status in children with acute asthma in predicting requirements for bronchodilator nebulization. METHODS: In this prospective observational study in children 2–18 y old with acute asthma, we evaluated the association between the CAS and routine clinical assessment as well as inter-rater agreement. RESULTS: The need for bronchodilator nebulization was assessed during 134 episodes of acute asthma in 47 children. Overall, bronchodilators were administered after routine clinical assessment in 74 episodes (55.2%). The median CAS was 2.5 (interquartile range of 2.0 –3.0) for subjects who did not receive nebulization and 6.0 (interquartile range of 4.0 –7.0) for subjects who did receive nebulization (P < .001). A CAS cutoff score of 4 yielded a sensitivity of 0.91 (95% CI 0.84–0.97) and a specificity of 0.77 (95% CI 0.66–0.87), with a positive predictive value of 0.83 (95% CI 0.75– 0.91) and a negative predictive value of 0.87 (95% CI 0.78–0.96). In 79 episodes, the CAS was assessed by 2 independent raters. With a weighted kappa of 0.77, a good inter-rater agreement was obtained. CONCLUSIONS: Using a cutoff value of 4, the newly developed CAS accurately predicts the requirement for bronchodilator nebulization in children with acute asthma without use of auscultative findings.

AB  - Adherence to inhaled steroids is suboptimal in many children with asthma and can lead to poor disease control. Many previous studies in paediatric populations have used subjective and inaccurate adherence measurements, reducing their validity. Adherence studies now often use objective electronic monitoring, which can give us an accurate indication of the extent of non-adherence in children with asthma. A review of the studies using electronic adherence monitoring shows that half of them report mean adherence rates of 50% or below, and the majority report rates below 75%. Reasons for non-adherence are both intentional and non-intentional, incorporating illness perceptions, medication beliefs and practical adherence barriers. Interventions to improve adherence in the paediatric population have had limited success, with the most effective containing both educational and behavioural aspects.

AB  - Non-response in cross-sectional data is not uncommon and requires careful handling during the analysis stage so as not to bias results. In this paper, we illustrate how subset correspondence analysis can be applied in order to manage the non-response while at the same time retaining all observed data. This variant of correspondence analysis was applied to a set of epidemiological data in which relationships between numerous environmental, genetic, behavioural and socio-economic factors and their association with asthma severity in children were explored. The application of subset correspondence analysis revealed interesting associations between the measured variables that otherwise may not have been exposed. Many of the associations found confirm established theories found in literature regarding factors that exacerbate childhood asthma. Moderate to severe asthma was found to be associated with needing neonatal care, male children, 8- to 9-year olds, exposure to tobacco smoke in vehicles and living in areas that suffer from extreme air pollution. Associations were found between mild persistent asthma and low birthweight, and being exposed to smoke in the home and living in a home with up to four people. The classification of probable asthma was associated with a group of variables that indicate low socio-economic status.

AB  - Rationale: Most genomic studies of lung function have used phenotypic data derived from a single time-point (e.g., presence/absence of disease) without considering the dynamic progression of a chronic disease.Objectives: To characterize lung function change over time in subjects with asthma and identify genetic contributors to a longitudinal phenotype.Methods: We present a method that models longitudinal FEV1 data, collected from 1,041 children with asthma who participated in the Childhood Asthma Management Program. This longitudinal progression model was built using population-based nonlinear mixed-effects modeling with an exponential structure and the determinants of age and height.Measurements and Main Results: We found ethnicity was a key covariate for FEV1 level. Budesonide-treated children with asthma had a slight but significant effect on FEV1 when compared with those treated with placebo or nedocromil (P < 0.001). A genome-wide association study identified seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms nominally associated with longitudinal lung function phenotypes in 581 white Childhood Asthma Management Program subjects (P < 10(-4) in the placebo ["discovery"] and P < 0.05 in the nedocromil treatment ["replication"] group). Using ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data, we found that some of the associated variants were in strong enhancer regions in human lung fibroblasts and may affect gene expression in human lung tissue. Genetic mapping restricted to genome-wide enhancer single-nucleotide polymorphisms in lung fibroblasts revealed a highly significant variant (rs6763931; P = 4 × 10(-6); false discovery rate < 0.05).Conclusions: This study offers a strategy to explore the genetic determinants of longitudinal phenotypes, provide a comprehensive picture of disease pathophysiology, and suggest potential treatment targets.

AB  - Background: The chitinase-like protein YKL-40 is thought to play a role in inflammation and tissue remodeling. In adults with severe asthma, YKL-40 is expressed in the airway and YKL-40 levels are elevated in the serum. Objective: To compare YKL-40 levels in children with severe persistent asthma with those in adults with severe persistent asthma and to determine whether YKL-40 levels correlate with increasing asthma severity in childhood asthma. Methods: In this prospective, cross-sectional study, 23 adults and 19 children with severe persistent asthma, 23 children with moderate persistent asthma, and 19 children with mild persistent asthma were enrolled. The following data were collected on each patient: spirometry, exhaled nitric oxide, percutaneous skin testing results to aeroallergens, peripheral eosinophils, serum IgE levels, and serum YKL-40 levels. Results: Compared with adults, children with severe persistent asthma had significantly lower YKL-40 levels, higher values for forced vital capacity and forced expiration volume in 1 second, higher serum IgE levels, and higher exhaled nitric oxide levels. YKL-40 levels did not correlate with increasing asthma severity in the pediatric cohort. Conclusion: Severe persistent asthma in childhood is not associated with elevated YKL-40 levels, unlike in adults with severe persistent asthma. YKL-40 is not a useful biomarker for asthma severity in childhood asthma.

AB  - Intravenous salbutamol is commonly used to treat children with severe asthma unresponsive to inhaled [beta]2-agonist therapy. However, in this setting, there is little clinical trial data demonstrating its effectiveness. Additionally, there are significant concerns that intravenous salbutamol-dosing recommendations for children with acute asthma are excessive, and unnecessarily raise the potential for adverse reactions, such as lactic acidosis and tachycardia which, by increasing respiratory workload, exacerbate respiratory failure. Here, we review salbutamol clinical pharmacology and toxicology, evidence relating to its use in acute asthma and highlight gaps in the evidence base.

AB  - Background and Objective: Bronchiolitis is the leading cause of hospitalization for US infants and is associated with increased risk of childhood asthma. Although studies have shown differences in the presentation and management of asthma across race/ethnicity, it is unclear if such differences are present for bronchiolitis. We examined if racial/ethnic differences exist in the presentation and management of severe bronchiolitis. Methods: We performed a 16-center, prospective cohort study from 2007 to 2010. Children <2 years old hospitalized with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis were included. A structured interview, chart review, and 1-week phone follow-up were completed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the independent association between race/ethnicity and diagnostic imaging, treatment (eg, albuterol, corticosteroids, and continuous positive airway pressure/intubation), management (eg, intensive care unit admission and length of stay), discharge on inhaled corticosteroids, and bronchiolitis relapse. Results: Among 2130 patients, 818 (38%) were non-Hispanic white (NHW), 511 (24%) were non-Hispanic black (NHB), and 801 (38%) were Hispanic. Compared with all groups, NHB children were most likely to receive albuterol before admission (odds ratio [OR]: 1.58; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20-2.07) and least likely to receive chest x-rays during hospitalization (OR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.49-0.90). Hispanic children were most likely to be discharged on inhaled corticosteroids (OR: 1.92; 95% CI: 1.19-3.10). Conclusion: We observed differences between NHW and minority children regarding preadmission albuterol use, inpatient diagnostic imaging, and prescription of inhaled corticosteroids at discharge, practices that deviate from the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines. The causes of these differences require further study, but they support implementation of care pathways for severe bronchiolitis.

AB  - Introduction: This study compared the frequency of antibiotic usage and the number of asthma episodes before and after the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric asthma patients who were followed up by specialists.Subjects and Methods: Included in this study were 334 patients (211 males and 123 females) of 2-16 years of age who were diagnosed with asthma and followed up for at least 1 year in our clinic. The frequency of antibiotic usage and the number of asthma episodes in the year prior to diagnosis and treatment were compared to these same variables after 1 year of follow-up by specialists.Results: The median age was 84 months (range: 24-192) and 212 (63%) children were at school or in day care centers. Atopy and a family history of asthma were present in 200 (60%) of the patients, and 137 (41%) reported that at least one member of their household smoked. Antibiotics were used a median number of 7 times [interquartile range (IQR) = 6] in the year before the asthma diagnosis, and 2 times (IQR = 3) during the year after treatment (p < 0.001). The mean number of asthma episodes before diagnosis, i.e. 4 (IQR = 8) was reduced to 0 (IQR = 2) in the year after treatment when the patients were followed up by specialists (p < 0.001).Conclusion: This study shows that appropriate diagnosis and treatment of childhood asthma significantly reduce the frequency of antibiotic usage and the number of asthmatic episodes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical implications of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) measurements in childhood asthma are unclear. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between the level of exhaled nitric oxide and pre-bronchodilator FEV1 and the change in FEV1 after bronchodilator in children with asthma. METHODS: This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study. We evaluated data from medical documentation of children with asthma with special attention to FENO results, asthma severity, FEV1 (% predicted), and bronchial reversibility test. RESULTS: Four hundred and five subjects (age 6-18 y) completed the study. Median levels of FENO increased linearly with subjects' age (P = .03). We found a nonlinear trend of pre-bronchodilator FEV1 across 4 quartiles of FENO in episodic and mild asthma; we observed lower pre-bronchodilator FEV1 in children with higher FENO, but only up to the FENO value of 35.4 ppb; in children with FENO value > 35.4 ppb, pre-bronchodilator FEV1 was increased. We found a linear increasing trend of change from baseline (after 400 μg of salbutamol) in FEV1 across FENO categories in children with moderate asthma. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a need to measure FENO before as well as after spirometry. Consequently, in children with asthma with bronchial obstruction, we suggest assessing FENO after short-acting β2 agonists as well.

AB  - Investigation of the human microbiome has become an important field of research facilitated by advances in sequencing technologies. The lung, which is one of the latest body sites being explored for the characterization of human-associated microbial communities, has a microbiome that is suspected to play a substantial role in health and disease. In this review, we provide an overview of the basics of microbiome studies. Challenges in the study of the lung microbiome are highlighted, and further attention is called to the optimization and standardization of methodologies to explore the role of the lung microbiome in health and disease. We also provide examples of lung microbial communities associated with disease or infection status and discuss the role of fungal species in the lung. Finally, we review studies demonstrating that the environmental microbiome can influence lung health and disease, such as the finding that the diversity of microbial exposure correlates inversely with the development of childhood asthma.

AB  - Rationale: Whether allergic airway inflammation mediates the association between overweight or obesity and childhood asthma is unknown.Objectives: To examine adiposity, asthma, and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) in U.S. children.Methods: Cross-sectional study of indicators of adiposity or obesity, FeNO (a biomarker of eosinophilic airway inflammation), and asthma in 2,681 children aged 6-17 years in the 2007-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Adiposity measures included body mass index (BMI), percent body fat (PBF), and waist circumference (WC).Measurements and Main Results: BMI, PBF, and WC were associated with asthma among children with low FeNO (odds ratio, 1.54-1.68; P < 0.01), but not among children with increased FeNO. Among children without asthma, BMI, PBF, and WC were associated with higher FEV1 and FVC, and lower FEV1/FVC. Among children with asthma and a high FeNO, all adiposity indicators were associated with decreased FEV1/FVC (β = -1.5% to -1.7% per z score) but not with FEV1 or FVC. Higher BMI or PBF was associated with worse asthma severity or control in children with asthma and increased FeNO, but not in children with asthma and low FeNO. Similar results were obtained in a secondary multivariate analysis of overweight or obesity (defined as BMI ≥85th percentile) and asthma or indicators of asthma severity or control, stratified by FeNO level.Conclusions: Adiposity indicators are associated with asthma in children with low FeNO. Among children with asthma, adiposity indicators are associated with worse asthma severity or control in those with high FeNO.

AB  - Rationale: Asthma prevalence, onset, remission and relapse, and healthcare use have been intensively studied. However, asthma symptom progression through childhood and adolescence has not been well studied, in part due to the challenges in obtaining consistent and robust long-term follow-up data on a large series of subjects with asthma.Objectives: To use the asthma diary symptom data of the Childhood Asthma Management Program placebo group (5 yr, 418 subjects, and total 564,518 records) to establish sex-specific high-resolution time courses of the natural progression of asthma symptoms through childhood and adolescence.Methods: We used the asthma diary symptom code as a measure of daily disease severity. Annual records of Tanner stage were used to determine the influence of puberty on severity. A data alignment technique was used to derive 13-year time courses of mean symptoms and mean Tanner stage.Measurements and Main Results: Data analyses showed three age- and sex-related phases of asthma symptom progression: Phase 1 (ages 5 and 6 yr)-greater severity in boys; Phase 2 (ages 7 to 9 yr)-no sex difference in severity; and Phase 3 (age 10-17 yr)-greater severity in girls. The continuous decline of symptoms in both sexes stops abruptly at the onset of puberty.Conclusions: The severity of asthma symptoms varies through childhood and adolescence, and patterns differ by sex. Puberty has a strong influence on symptom progression in both sexes. Progression of symptoms is a distinct aspect of asthma epidemiology.

AB  - Background: The presence of visible mold in households is associated with asthma. However, the role of "classroom fungus" in the development of childhood asthma, as well as the fungal species that may lead to asthma, remains controversial. This nationwide school survey was conducted to investigate the correlation between fungal spores in classrooms and asthma in schoolchildren.Methods: From April to May 2011, a cross-sectional survey was conducted to assess allergic/asthmatic conditions in schoolchildren aged 6 to 15 years old in 44 schools across Taiwan. Personal histories and current asthmatic conditions were collected using a modified International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire. Fungal spores in classroom were collected using a Burkard Personal Air Sampler and counted under light microscopy. Three-level hierarchical modeling was used to determine the complex correlation between fungal spores in classrooms and childhood asthma.Results: The survey was completed by 6,346 out of 7,154 parents (88.7%). The prevalences of physician-diagnosed asthma, current asthma, and asthma with symptoms reduced on holidays or weekends (ASROH) were 11.7%, 7.5%, and 3.1%, respectively. The geometric mean spore concentrations of total fungi, Aspergillus/Penicillium, and basidiospores were 2,181, 49, and 318 spores/m3. Aspergillus/Penicillium and basidiospores were significantly correlated with current asthma and ASROH after adjusting for personal and school factors. Of those with current asthma, 41% reported relief of symptoms during weekends.Conclusions: Classroom Aspergillus/Penicillium and basidiospores are significantly associated with childhood asthma and ASROH. Government health policy should explore environmental interventions for the elimination of fungal spores in classrooms to reduce the prevalence of childhood asthma.

AB  - Background We examined the feasibility of self-directed Triple P ' Positive Parenting Programme' for optimizing parents' management of childhood asthma and behaviour. Methods Eligible families were invited to access asthma-specific web-based Triple P as part of a preliminary randomized controlled study. Results Initial study information and introductory website pages received considerable interest but intervention uptake was poor with high rates of attrition. Conclusions Although parents of children with asthma show willingness to access web-based parenting support, further work is necessary to develop engaging websites and determine barriers to uptake, and adherence to online parenting interventions with this population.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare asthma control assessment using the Asthma APGAR system, a tool developed by primary care clinicians, in a multicenter primary care sample with the Asthma Control Test (ACT[TM])/Childhood Asthma Control Test (CACT[TM]), a tool developed by asthma specialists. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a substudy of a multicenter, randomized, controlled pragmatic trial that tests the effectiveness of the Asthma APGAR system in primary care practices. As part of the study, enrolled patients completed both the ACT[TM]/CACT[TM] and the Asthma APGAR system between March 1, 2011, and December 31, 2011. Kappa and McNemar statistics were used to compare the results of questionnaires. RESULTS: Of the 468 patients in our sample, 306 (65%) were classified as not controlled by the ACT[TM]/CACT[TM] or the Asthma APGAR system. The overall agreement was 84.4%, with a kappa value of .68 (substantial agreement) and a McNemar test P value of .35 (suggesting no significant difference in the direction of disagreement). Of those with poor control as defined by the Asthma APGAR system, 23.8% (73) had no controller medications and 76.5% (234) were seldom or sometimes able to avoid identified triggers for their asthma. Of those who stated that they had been prescribed controller medications, 116 of 332 (35%) stated that they did not use the controller medication on a daily basis. CONCLUSION: The Asthma APGAR system and the ACT[TM]/CACT[TM] similarly assess asthma control in a multicenter primary care-based sample. The Asthma APGAR system identified an 'actionable item' in more than 75% (234) of the individuals with poor asthma control, thus linking an assessment of poor asthma control with a management strategy.

AB  - Background: Observational studies have reported associations between body mass index (BMI) and asthma, but confounding and reverse causality remain plausible explanations. We aim to investigate evidence for a causal effect of BMI on asthma using a Mendelian randomization approach.Methods and Findings: We used Mendelian randomization to investigate causal effects of BMI, fat mass, and lean mass on current asthma at age 7½ y in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). A weighted allele score based on 32 independent BMI-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was derived from external data, and associations with BMI, fat mass, lean mass, and asthma were estimated. We derived instrumental variable (IV) estimates of causal risk ratios (RRs). 4,835 children had available data on BMI-associated SNPs, asthma, and BMI. The weighted allele score was strongly associated with BMI, fat mass, and lean mass (all p-values<0.001) and with childhood asthma (RR 2.56, 95% CI 1.38-4.76 per unit score, p = 0.003). The estimated causal RR for the effect of BMI on asthma was 1.55 (95% CI 1.16-2.07) per kg/m2, p = 0.003. This effect appeared stronger for non-atopic (1.90, 95% CI 1.19-3.03) than for atopic asthma (1.37, 95% CI 0.89-2.11) though there was little evidence of heterogeneity (p = 0.31). The estimated causal RRs for the effects of fat mass and lean mass on asthma were 1.41 (95% CI 1.11-1.79) per 0.5 kg and 2.25 (95% CI 1.23-4.11) per kg, respectively. The possibility of genetic pleiotropy could not be discounted completely; however, additional IV analyses using FTO variant rs1558902 and the other BMI-related SNPs separately provided similar causal effects with wider confidence intervals. Loss of follow-up was unlikely to bias the estimated effects.Conclusions: Higher BMI increases the risk of asthma in mid-childhood. Higher BMI may have contributed to the increase in asthma risk toward the end of the 20th century. Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary.

AB  - Rationale: Better characterization of childhood wheeze phenotypes using newer statistical methods provides a basis for addressing the heterogeneity of childhood asthma. Outcomes of these phenotypes beyond childhood are unknown. Objectives: To determine if adolescent respiratory symptoms, lung function, and changes in lung function over adolescence differ by childhood wheeze phenotypes defined through latent class analysis. Methods: A prospective birth cohort (Melbourne Atopy Cohort Study) followed 620 high allergy-risk children, recording respiratory symptoms and spirometry at 12 and 18 years. Regression analyses identified relationships between wheeze phenotypes (never/infrequent, early transient, early persistent, intermediate onset, and late onset) and lung function, change in lung function (12-18 yr), respiratory symptoms, and asthma. The baseline classification was never/infrequent wheeze. Measurements and Main Results: Deficits in expected growth of lung function, measured by change in prebronchodilator FEV1 between 12 and 18 years, were found for early persistent (reduced 290 ml; 95% confidence interval [CI], 82-498), intermediate-onset (reduced 210 ml; 95% CI, 62-359), and late-onset wheeze (reduced 255 ml; 95% CI, 69-442). Intermediate-onset wheezers had persistent FEV1 deficit after bronchodilator at 18 years (reduced 198 ml; 46,350). Current asthma risk was increased for all phenotypes except early transient, which was also not associated with lung function deficits at 12 or 18 years. Conclusions: Persistent wheeze phenotypes in childhood were associated with reduced growth in prebronchodilator FEV1 over adolescence. Intermediate-onset wheezers showed irreversible airflow limitation by 18 years. Conversely, early transient wheeze was a benign condition with no sequelae for respiratory health by age 18.

AB  - Background: Animal data suggest that tobacco smoke exposure of a mother when she is in utero influences DNA methylation patterns in her offspring and that there is an effect on the respiratory system, particularly airway responsiveness. The only study, to our knowledge, in humans suggests that there is a similar effect on asthma. The present study tests whether an association with respiratory problems can be confirmed in a large population study and aims to determine whether in utero exposure of the father has similar effects on his offspring.Methods: Information from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children was used to compare the offspring of women and of men who had themselves been exposed to cigarette smoke in utero; separate analyses were performed for children of women smokers and nonsmokers. The outcome measures were trajectories of history of early wheezing, doctor-diagnosed asthma by age 7 years, and results of lung function and methacholine challenge tests at 8 years. A variety of social and environmental factors were taken into account; offspring sexes were examined separately.Results: There was no association with any outcome in relation to maternal prenatal exposure. There was some evidence of an increase in asthma risk with paternal prenatal exposure when the study mother was a nonsmoker (adjusted OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.97-1.41). This was particularly strong for girls (adjusted OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.04-1.86).Conclusions: We did not find that maternal prenatal exposure to her mother's smoking had any effect on her children's respiratory outcomes. There was suggestive evidence of paternal prenatal exposure being associated with asthma and persistent wheezing in the granddaughters.

AB  - Background: Passive smoking, or environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), is a risk factor for lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, and childhood asthma, but a relationship with COPD has not been fully established. Our aim was to study ETS as a risk factor for COPD in never smokers.Methods: Data from three cross-sectional studies within the Obstructive Lung Disease in Northern Sweden (OLIN) database were pooled. Of the 2,182 lifelong never smokers, 2,118 completed structured interviews and spirometry of acceptable quality. COPD was defined according to the GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) criteria using postbronchodilator spirometry. The association of COPD with ETS in single and multiple settings was calculated by multivariate logistic regression adjusting for known risk factors for COPD.Results: COPD prevalence was associated with increased ETS exposure: 4.2% (no ETS), 8.0% (ETS ever at home), 8.3% (ETS at previous work), and 14.7% (ETS ever at home and at both previous and current work), test for trend P = .003. Exclusion of subjects aged ≥ 65 years and subjects reporting asthma yielded similar results. ETS in multiple settings, such as ever at home and at both previous and current work, was strongly associated to COPD (OR, 3.80; 95% CI, 1.29-11.2).Conclusions: In this population-based sample of never smokers, ETS was independently associated with COPD. The association was stronger for ETS in multiple settings. ETS in multiple settings was, after age, the strongest risk factor for COPD and comparable to personal smoking of up to 14 cigarettes/d in comparable materials. The findings strongly advocate measures against smoking in public places.

AB  - Rationale: Available prospective studies of obesity and asthma have used only body mass index (BMI) as an indicator for adiposity; studies using detailed obesity measures are lacking, and the role of physical fitness level and sedentary time remains unexplored in the link between obesity and asthma. Objectives: To compare various anthropometric measures of obesity in relation to childhood asthma, and to further characterize the interrelations among central obesity, physical fitness level, sedentary time, and asthma. Methods: The nationwide Taiwan Children Health Study followed 2,758 schoolchildren from fourth to sixth grade, annually collecting data regarding physical fitness, sedentary time, obesity measures (comprising body weight and height, abdominal and hip circumference, skin fold thickness, and body composition), asthma, and pulmonary function tests. The generalized estimating equation was used for 3 years of repeated measurements to analyze the interrelation among obesity, sedentary time, physical fitness level, and asthma; a structural equation model was used to explore the pathogenesis among these factors. Asthma incidence was analyzed during a 2-year follow-up among centrally obese and nonobese groups in baseline children without asthma. Measurements and Main Results: Central obesity most accurately predicts asthma. Low physical fitness levels and high screen time increase the risk of central obesity, which leads to asthma development. Obesity-related reduction in pulmonary function is a possible mechanism in the pathway from central obesity to asthma. Conclusions: Central obesity measures should be incorporated in childhood asthma risk predictions. Children are encouraged to increase their physical fitness levels and reduce their sedentary time to prevent central obesity-related asthma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Atopic conditions are prevalent in the Western world, with limited long-term data on atopic trends in patients with asthma. OBJECTIVE: To describe the trends in eczema, rhinitis, and allergic sensitization in a longitudinal childhood asthma cohort. METHODS: Four hundred eighty-four patients were recruited at 7 years of age and followed regularly to 50 years of age. Subjects completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire to define current eczema and rhinitis. Skin prick testing to rye grass also was performed. RESULTS: The participation rate over the past 4 decades has been maintained at 72% to 91%. There was a decrease in the prevalence of eczema in the past 12 months in groups with viral-associated wheeze (21% to 8%, P = .002), asthma (47% to 18%, P < .001), and severe asthma (69% to 28%, P < .001) from 14 to 21 years of age. Conversely, there was an increase in the prevalence of rhinitis in the previous 12 months in groups without asthma (1% to 6%, P = .04; 1% to 20%, P = .008), with viral-associated wheeze (16% to 28%, P = .006; 16% to 49%, P < .001), and with asthma (45% to 56%, P = .2; 45% to 73%, P = .014) from recruitment to 10 and 14 years of age, respectively. There were 2 peaks in prevalence in the sensitization to rye grass in this cohort from 7 to 10 years of age and from 14 to 21 years of age in all groups. CONCLUSION: The adolescence phase appears to be an important period in the body's response to allergens whereby eczema decreases in prevalence, whereas rhinitis and rye grass sensitization increase in prevalence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of asthma has increased alarmingly in the past 2 to 3 decades. Increased antibiotic use in infancy has been suggested to limit exposure to gastrointestinal microbes and to predispose to asthma in later life. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between antibiotic exposure during the first year of life and the development of asthma up to the age of 7 years. METHODS: A retrospective population-based study of a cohort of children enrolled in a nationwide employer-provided health insurance plan from January 1, 1999, through December 31, 2006, in the United States (n = 62,576). We evaluated the association between antibiotic exposure during the first year of life and subsequent development of 3 asthma phenotypes: transient wheezing (began and resolved before 3 years of age), late-onset asthma (began after 3 years of age), and persistent asthma (began before 3 years of age and persisted through 4-7 years of age). RESULTS: Antibiotic use in the first year of life was associated with the development of transient wheezing (odds ratio [OR], 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9-2.2; P < .001) and persistent asthma (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.5-1.7; P < .001). A dose-response effect was observed. When 5 or more antibiotic courses were received, the odds of persistent asthma doubled (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.5-2.6; P < .001). There is no association between antibiotic use and late-onset asthma. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic use in the first year life is associated with an increased risk of early-onset childhood asthma that began before 3 years of age. The apparent effect has a clear dose response. Heightened caution about avoiding unnecessary use of antibiotics in infants is warranted.

AB  - Asthma is a common disease with enormous public health costs, and its primary prevention is an ambitious and important goal. Understanding of how host and environmental factors interact to cause asthma is incomplete, but persistent questions about mechanisms should not stop clinical research efforts aimed at reducing the prevalence of childhood asthma. Achieving the goal of primary prevention of asthma will involve integrated and parallel sets of research activities in which mechanism-oriented studies of asthma inception proceed alongside clinical intervention studies to test biologically plausible prevention ideas. For example, continued research is needed, particularly in young children, to uncover biomarkers that identify asthma risk and provide potential targets of intervention, and to improve understanding of the role of microbial factors in asthma risk and disease initiation. In terms of clinical trials that could be initiated now or in the near future, we recommend three interventions for testing: (1) preventing asthma through prophylaxis against respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus infections of the airway; (2) immune modulation, using prebiotics, probiotics, and bacterial lysates; and (3) prevention of allergen sensitization and allergic inflammation, using anti-IgE. These interventions should be tested while other, more universal prevention measures that may promote lung health are also investigated. These potential universal lung health measures include prevention of preterm delivery; reduced exposure of the fetus and young infant to environmental pollutants, including tobacco smoke; prevention of maternal and child obesity; and management of psychosocial stress.

AB  - Background: Asthma is caused by the combination of different factors. Current concepts of asthma pathogenesis emphasize on gene-environment interactions. Mega-genome scanning projects revealed that different Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are related to asthma susceptibility. rs7216389-T is one of them that is related to childhood asthma and its effect on childhood asthma severity has been proved in different nations, however no study has been performed in Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East countries yet. Methods: To perform population genetic studies, a rapid and high-throughput screening method is necessary. High-resolution melting analysis is a rapid, powerful and accurate method, which is suitable for this type of studies. Therefore, it has been decided to develop a high-resolution melting method for rs7216389 locus genotyping in Iranian asthmatic children. In the current study, a high-resolution melting analysis method based on SYBR Green-I was developed to check the frequency of rs7216389-T mutation in Iranian asthmatic children for the first time. Results: Second and third classes of intercalating dyes are commonly used for high-resolution melting method. However, in this study, SYBR Green-I was used for rs7216389 locus genotyping for the first time. Our results for 60 samples showed that SYBR Green-I has good efficacy for rs7216389 locus genotyping through high-resolution melting method in comparison with PCR-RFLP and sequencing. Conclusion: Comparison of our results based on HRM analysis with PCR-RFLP showed that our developed method is rapid, accurate, high-throughput and economic to study the rs7216389 locus in asthmatic children and it is applicable for other similar population genetic studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Genetics may partially explain observed heterogeneity in associations between traffic-related air pollution and incident asthma. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to investigate the impact of gene variants associated with oxidative stress and inflammation on associations between air pollution and incident childhood asthma. METHODS: Traffic-related air pollution, asthma, wheeze, gene variant, and potential confounder data were pooled across six birth cohorts. Parents reported physician-diagnosed asthma and wheeze from birth to 7-8 years of age (confirmed by pediatric allergist in two cohorts). Individual estimates of annual average air pollution [nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5), PM2.5 absorbance, ozone] were assigned to each child's birth address using land use regression, atmospheric modeling, and ambient monitoring data. Effect modification by variants in GSTP1 (rs1138272/Ala114Val and rs1695/IIe105Val) and TNF (rs1800629/G-308A) was investigated. RESULTS: Data on asthma, wheeze, potential confounders, at least one SNP of interest, and NO2 were available for 5,115 children. GSTP1 rs1138272 and TNF rs1800629 SNPs were associated with asthma and wheeze, respectively. In relation to air pollution exposure, children with one or more GSTP1 rs1138272 minor allele were at increased risk of current asthma [odds ratio (OR) = 2.59; 95% CI: 1.43, 4.68 per 10 μg/m3 NO2] and ever asthma (OR = 1.64; 95% CI: 1.06, 2.53) compared with homozygous major allele carriers (OR = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.68, 1.32 for current and OR = 1.20; 95% CI: 0.98, 1.48 for ever asthma; Bonferroni-corrected interaction p = 0.04 and 0.01, respectively). Similarly, for GSTP1 rs1695, associations between NO2 and current and ever asthma had ORs of 1.43 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.98) and 1.36 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.70), respectively, for minor allele carriers compared with ORs of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.52, 1.32) and 1.12 (95% CI: 0.84, 1.49) for homozygous major allele carriers (Bonferroni-corrected interaction p-values 0.48 and 0.09). There were no clear differences by TNF genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Children carrying GSTP1 rs1138272 or rs1695 minor alleles may constitute a susceptible population at increased risk of asthma associated with air pollution.

AB  - Asthma is an important public health problem in urban Latin America. This study aimed to analyze the role of socioeconomic and environmental factors as potential determinants of asthma symptoms prevalence in children from Latin American (LA) urban centers. We selected 31 LA urban centers with complete data, and an ecological analysis was performed. According to our theoretical framework, the explanatory variables were classified in three levels: distal, intermediate, and proximate. The association between variables in the three levels and prevalence of asthma symptoms was examined by bivariate and multivariate linear regression analysis weighed by sample size. In a second stage, we fitted several linear regression models introducing sequentially the variables according to the predefined hierarchy. In the final hierarchical model Gini Index, crowding, sanitation, variation in infant mortality rates and homicide rates, explained great part of the variance in asthma prevalence between centers (R = 75.0 %). We found a strong association between socioeconomic and environmental variables and prevalence of asthma symptoms in LA urban children, and according to our hierarchical framework and the results found we suggest that social inequalities (measured by the Gini Index) is a central determinant to explain high prevalence of asthma in LA.

AB  - Purpose: To assess psychometric properties of the Pelican instrument, an online Dutch self-administered Quality of Life instrument for childhood asthma for scientific and clinical use.Methods: A cohort study was done in two asthma populations and healthy children. One asthma population had assessment at start, 4 and 8 weeks. The other asthma population and healthy children had one assessment. All children were aged 6-12 years. Children completed the Pelican instrument, Paediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, feeling thermometer and Childhood Asthma Control Test. Lung function and fraction exhaled nitric oxide were measured. Parents completed Functional Status II, Asthma Control Questionnaire, Childhood Asthma Control Test questionnaires and symptom diaries. We assessed interpretability, structural validity, internal consistency, reliability, construct and discriminative validity of the Pelican instrument.Results: Eighty-five asthmatic (mean age 8.5 years) and 49 healthy children (mean age 8.4 years) participated. The Pelican instrument has 5 domains with 21 items after factor analysis. Internal consistency was 0.89 (CI 0.85-0.92), domain reliability showed Cronbach's α's from 0.64 to 0.76 and item-to-scale correlations from 0.61 to 0.81. Test-retest reliability was confirmed ICC = 0.88 (CI 0.79-0.93). Construct validity was demonstrated by significant moderate correlations with other relevant asthma outcomes like PAQLQ (r = -0.59, p < 0.01). Discriminative capacity between controlled or uncontrolled asthma (t = 3.20, p < 0.01, Δ = 0.64) and asthma versus healthy subjects (t = 6.31, p < 0.01, Δ = 0.94) was found.Conclusions: The psychometric properties of the Pelican instrument were acceptable in Dutch paediatric asthma patients between 6 and 12 years old.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the association between gestational age at birth and the risk of subsequent development of asthma.Study Design: We conducted a retrospective observational hospital-based birth case-control study in a university-based obstetrics and gynecology department in Finland. A total of 44,173 women delivering between 1989 and 2008 were linked with the social insurance register to identify asthma reimbursements for their offspring (n = 2661). Pregnancy factors were recorded during pregnancy. Infants were categorized as moderately preterm (≤ 32 weeks), late preterm (33-36 weeks), early term (37-38 weeks), term (39-40 weeks), or late term and postterm (≥ 41 weeks). The main outcome measure was asthma among the infants.Results: Children born moderately preterm (≤ 32 weeks gestation) had a significantly increased risk of asthma (aOR, 3.9; 95% CI, 3.2-4.8). The risk of asthma was also increased in those born late preterm (aOR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.4-2.0) and early term (aOR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-1.4). In contrast, delivery at 41 weeks or later seemed to decrease the risk of asthma (aOR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.8-1.0). The burden of asthma associated with preterm birth was associated mainly with early term infants, in whom 108 extra cases of asthma were observed.Conclusion: Even though the individual risk of asthma was inversely correlated with gestational age at birth, the overall burden brought about by delivery before term was associated with late preterm and early term deliveries. Furthermore, delivery after term was protective against asthma.

AB  - Objective: To assess the timing of pediatric asthma rehospitalization, variation in rate of rehospitalization across hospitals, and factors associated with rehospitalization at different intervals.Study Design: Retrospective cohort analysis of 44,204 hospitalizations for children with asthma within 42 children's hospitals between July 2008 and June 2011. The main outcome measures were rehospitalization for asthma within 7, 15, 30, 60, 180, and 365 days of an index asthma admission.Results: The rate of asthma rehospitalization ranged from 0.5% (n = 208) at 7 days to 17.2% (n = 7603) at 365 days. Black patients and patients with public insurance had higher odds of rehospitalization at 60 days and beyond (P ≤ .01 for both). Adolescents (12- to 18-year-old), patients with a diagnosis of a complex chronic condition, and patients with a prior year asthma admission had higher odds of rehospitalization at every time interval (P ≤ .001 for all). Significant hospital variation in case-mix adjusted rates of rehospitalization existed at each time interval (P ≤ .01 for all). Rates at 365 days were ≤ 10.9% for the top 10% of hospitals; if all hospitals achieved this rate, 36.6% of rehospitalizations might have been avoided.Conclusions: Significant variation in asthma rehospitalization rates exists across children's hospitals from 7 to 365 days after an index admission. Racial/ethnic and economic disparities emerge at 60 days. By 1 year, rehospitalizations account for 1 in 6 hospitalizations. Assessing asthma rehospitalizations at longer intervals may augment our current understanding of and approach to post-hospitalization care improvement.

AB  - Introduction: The prevalence of childhood asthma in the United States increased from 8.7% in 2001 to 9.5% in 2011. This increased prevalence adds to the costs incurred by state Medicaid programs. We provide state-based cost estimates of pediatric asthma emergency department (ED) visits and highlight an opportunity for states to reduce these costs through a recently changed Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) regulation.Methods: We used a cross-sectional design across multiple data sets to produce state-based cost estimates for asthma-related ED visits among children younger than 18, where Medicaid/CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program) was the primary payer.Results: There were approximately 629,000 ED visits for pediatric asthma for Medicaid/CHIP enrollees, which cost $272 million in 2010. The average cost per visit was $433. Costs ranged from $282,000 in Alaska to more than $25 million in California.Conclusions: Costs to states for pediatric asthma ED visits vary widely. Effective January 1, 2014, the CMS rule expanded which type of providers can be reimbursed for providing preventive services to Medicaid/CHIP beneficiaries. This rule change, in combination with existing flexibility for states to define practice setting, allows state Medicaid programs to reimburse for asthma interventions that use nontraditional providers (such as community health workers or certified asthma educators) in a nonclinical setting, as long as the service was initially recommended by a physician or other licensed practitioner. The rule change may help states reduce Medicaid costs of asthma treatment and the severity of pediatric asthma.

AB  - Rationale: Clinical and epidemiologic approaches have identified two distinct sets of classifications for asthma and wheeze phenotypes. Objectives: To compare epidemiologic phenotype definitions identified by latent class analysis (LCA) with clinical phenotypes based on patient histories, diagnostic work-up, and treatment responses. To relate phenotypes to genetic and environmental determinants as well as diagnostic and treatment-related parameters. Methods: LCA was performed in an international multicenter birth cohort based on yearly questions about current wheeze until age 6 years. Associations of wheeze classes and clinical phenotypes with asthma-related characteristics such as atopy, lung function, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide, and medication use were calculated using regression models. Measurements and Main Results: LCA identified five classes, which verified the clinically defined wheeze phenotypes with high sensitivity and specificity; the respective receiver operating characteristics curves displayed an area under the curve ranging from 84% (frequent wheeze) to 85% (asthma diagnosis) and 87% (unremitting wheeze) to 97% (recurrent unremitting wheeze). Recurrent unremitting wheeze was the most specific and unremitting wheeze at least once the most sensitive definition. The latter identified a subgroup of children with decreased lung function, increased genetic risk, and in utero smoke exposure (odds ratio, 2.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-3.68; P = 0.0191), but without established asthma diagnosis and treatment. Conclusions: Clinical phenotypes were well supported by LCA analysis. The hypothesis-free LCA phenotypes were a useful reference for comparing clinical phenotypes. Thereby, we identified children with clinically conspicuous but undiagnosed disease. Because of their high area under the curve values, clinical phenotypes such as (recurrent) unremitting wheeze emerged as promising alternative asthma definitions for epidemiologic studies.

AB  - Genetic variations in the 17q21 locus are strongly associated with childhood nonallergic asthma. Expression of the 17q21 genes, orosomucoid like 3 (ORMDL3) and gasdermin B (GSMDB), is affected by these disease-associated variants. However, until recently, no functional connection of the protein products coded by these genes with asthma was known. Lately, it has been identified that ORMDL3 function has been related to various cellular processes that could be relevant for the pathogenesis of asthma. This includes dysregulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) associated with airway remodeling and also an effect of ORMDL3-dysregulated sphingolipid synthesis on bronchial hyperreactivity. These findings are crucial for a better understanding of the mechanism of childhood asthma and may lead to asthma therapeutics that target pathways previously not thought to be related to this common pediatric respiratory disease. Furthermore, this may validate the unbiased genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach for complex diseases such as asthma, to better define pathomechanisms and drug targets.

AB  - Objectives. We assessed the benefits of adding weatherization-plus-health interventions to an in-home, community health worker (CHW) education program on asthma control. Methods. Weused a quasi-experimental design to compare study group homes (n = 34) receiving CHW education and weatherization-plus-health structural interventions with historical comparison group homes (n = 68) receiving only education. Data were collected in King County, Washington, from October 2009 to September 2010. Results. Over the 1-year study period, the percentage of study group children with not-well-controlled or very poorly controlled asthma decreased more than the comparison group percentage (100% to 28.8% vs 100% to 51.6%; P = .04). Study group caregiver quality-of-life improvements exceeded comparison group improvements (P = .002) by 0.7 units, a clinically important difference. The decrease in study home asthma triggers (evidence of mold, water damage, pests, smoking) was marginally greater than the comparison group decrease (P = .089). Except for mouse allergen, the percentage of study group allergen floor dust samples at or above the detection limit decreased, although most reductions were not statistically significant. Conclusions. Combining weatherization and healthy home interventions (e.g., improved ventilation, moisture and mold reduction, carpet replacement, and plumbing repairs) with CHW asthma education significantly improves childhood asthma control.

AB  - Rationale: Asthma is a variable condition with an apparent tendency for a natural decline in asthma symptoms and health care use occurring as children age. As a result, asthma interventions using a pre-post design may overestimate the intervention effect when no proper control group is available.Objectives: Investigate patterns of natural decline over time with increasing age in asthma symptoms and health care use of children. Develop a statistical procedure that enables adjustment that accounts for expected declines in these outcomes and is useable when intervention evaluations must rely solely on pre-post data.Methods: Mixed-effects models with mixture distributions were used to describe the pattern of symptoms and health care use in 3,021 children aged 2 to 15 years in a combined sample from three controlled trials. An adaptive least squares estimation was used to account for overestimation of intervention effects and make adjustments for pre-post only data. Termed "Adjustment for Natural Declines in Asthma Outcomes (ANDAO)," the adjustment method uses bootstrap sampling to create control cohorts comparable to subjects in the intervention study from existing control subjects. ANDAO accounts for expected declines in outcomes and is beneficial when intervention evaluations must rely solely on pre-post data.Measurements and Main Results: Children under 10 years of age experienced 18% (95% confidence interval, 15-21%) fewer symptom days and 28% (95% confidence interval, 24-32%) fewer symptom nights with each additional year of age. The decline was less than 10% after age 10 years, depending on baseline asthma severity. Emergency department visits declined regardless of baseline symptom frequency (P = 0.02). The adjustment method corrected estimates to within 2.4% of true effects through simulations using control cohorts.Conclusions: Because of the declines in symptoms and health care use expected with increasing age of children with asthma, pre-post comparisons will greatly overestimate intervention effects. The ANDAO provides means to adequately estimate treatment effects when a control group design is not possible.

AB  - Background: Multiple imputation is a reliable tool to deal with missing data and is becoming increasingly popular in biostatistics. However, building a model with interactions that are not specified a priori, in the presence of missing data, presents a challenge. On the one hand, the interactions are needed to impute the data, while on the other hand, the data is needed to identify the interactions. The objective of this study was to present a way in which this challenge can be addressed.Methods: This paper investigates two strategies in which model development with interactions is achieved using a single data set generated from the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. Imputation using both the fully conditional specification approach and the multivariate normal approach is carried out and results are compared. The strategies are illustrated with data from a study of ambient pollution and childhood asthma in Durban, South Africa.Results: The different approaches to model building and imputation yielded similar results despite the data being mainly categorical. Both strategies investigated for building the model using the multivariate normal imputed data resulted in the identical set of variables and interactions being identified; while models built using data imputed by fully conditional specification were marginally different for the two strategies. It was found that, for both imputation approaches, model building with backward elimination applied to the initial EM data set was easier to implement, and produced good results, compared to those from a complete case analysis.Conclusions: Developing a predictive model including interactions with data that suffers from missingness is easily done by identifying significant interactions and then applying backward elimination to a single data set imputed from the EM algorithm. It is hoped that this idea can be further developed and, by addressing this practical dilemma, there will be increased adoption of multiple imputation in medical research when data suffers from missingness.

AB  - Background: Low birth weight is strongly correlated with an increased risk of adult diseases. Additionally, low birth weight might be a risk factor for asthma later in life.Methods: A systematic literature search of the PubMed database from 1966 to November 2013 was conducted. The criteria for inclusion of papers were as follows: case-control or cohort studies; the odds ratio (OR) or risk ratio (RR) estimates with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were presented, or there were sufficient data for calculation; and studies were published in English up to October 2013. Random-effect and fixed-effect meta-analyses, meta-regression, and cumulative meta-analysis were conducted.Results: Thirteen cohort studies and 1,105,703 subjects were included. The overall pooled RRs (95% CIs) of asthma risk for low birth weight were 1.162 (fixed-effects model, 95% CI, 1.128-1.197) and 1.152 (random-effects model, 95% CI, 1.082-1.222). In stratified analyses, the effect of low birth weight on childhood asthma was strong, particularly in studies conducted in Europe, those with a small sample size, and those published recently. A meta-regression analysis did not find significant determinants.Conclusions: This meta-analysis shows that low birth weight significantly increases the risk of childhood asthma.

AB  - Background: Recent investigations suggested that the trend of childhood asthma has been stabilizing or even reversing in some countries. The observation provides contrast to our experience. Thus, the study aimed to investigate the prevalence and clinical features of asthma in children aged 0-14 years in Qingdao China, determine the changes of childhood asthma in China, and discover evidence that can allow better diagnosis and treatment of childhood asthma.Methods: A cluster sampling method was used. We randomly extracted the investigation clusters from schools, kindergartens, and communities in Qingdao. Subsequently, we interviewed the members of the clusters using a questionnaire from the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) to find children with asthmatic symptoms. After determination by the doctors, more details on the asthmatic children were obtained by asking questions from the National Epidemiology Study of Asthma and Allergies in China questionnaire to obtain more details. We intended to survey 10,800 children. However, the actual number of children was 10,082.Results: The prevalence of asthma in Qingdao children aged 0-14 years was 3.69%. The prevalence among male children was higher than in female (χ2 = 24.53,P < 0.01). Among the asthmatic children, 68.0% had their first attack when they were less than three years old. Moreover, 71.2% once suffered respiratory tract infections. For 95.7% of asthmatic children, the asthma attack was first manifested as cough. Asthmatic children who used inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) only accounted for 46%.Conclusions: The prevalence of asthma in children aged 0-14 years in Qingdao China increased significantly based on data obtained ten years ago (2000). Respiratory tract infections were the most important precursors of asthma attack. The attack was most commonly manifested as cough. The treatment, especially the use of ICS, was more rational. However, a certain difference was found, which has yet to be contrasted with the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) project.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to provide an update on childhood asthma specifically related to the underlying genetic background and pathophysiology of asthma and their interaction with environmental stimuli. We will also discuss emerging data in the field of disease phenotyping. RECENT FINDINGS: The field of genetics is continuously evolving to expand our knowledge on the cause of disease. Childhood onset asthma has been related to atopy and exposure to early-life infections. More recently, phenotypes have been used to classify asthma as transient and persistent, but the association of each phenotype with the genetic origin of asthma is not clearly understood. SUMMARY: This review covers the topics of genetics, epigenetics, pathophysiology, phenotypes and treatment as they relate to childhood asthma. Overall, it provides a basis for the future of asthma treatment through description of the current research.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Antibiotic exposure in children is a possible contributor to the increasing asthma prevalence in several countries. The present study aimed to investigate the association between antibiotic exposure and the risk of developing childhood asthma at 2-8 years of age. METHODS: A case-control study was undertaken among children aged 2-8 years old between March and September 2010 in the Urmia district in the northwest of Iran. The cases were doctor-diagnosed asthmatic children based on Global Initiative for Asthma criteria (n=207), and the controls were children without respiratory symptoms (n=400) selected by frequency matching by age and gender. Clinical data including antibiotic exposure was collected by a validated and reliable questionnaire, which was completed by interviewing parents/guardians. RESULTS: Antibiotic consumption during the first year of life increased the odds ratio [OR] of asthma symptoms at 2-8 years of age (crude OR, 2.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.53-3.35; p<0.01), and the strength of association was similar after adjusting for a family history of asthma or atopic disorder, preterm delivery, birth order, and delivery method (adjusted OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.27-2.88; p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that antibiotic consumption in children was associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma, and an additional confirmative study is needed.

AB  - Background Epidemiological studies on the effect of urban air pollution on childhood asthma have shown conflicting results and so far no consistent association has emerged. However, a common limitation in previous studies has been exposure misclassification leading to uncertainties in risk estimates.The aim of this study was to analyse the effects of long-term exposure to particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on the prevalence of asthma and wheeze within a populationbased birth cohort-the Manchester Asthma and Allergy Study (MAAS). Methods The prevalence of asthma and current wheeze within the cohort (N=1185) was determined through parental questionnaires at ages 3, 5, 8 and 11 years. The typical monthly PM10 and NO2 exposure of each child was estimated through a novel microenvironmental exposure model from birth to age 11. The association between exposure and asthma or wheeze was analysed using generalised estimating equations and multiple logistic regression. Results The range of asthma prevalence was 15.2- 23.3%, with the lowest prevalence at age 3 and the highest at age 5. The prevalence of current wheeze decreased from ages 3 to 8 (23.7-18%). The mean NO2 exposure decreased from the 1st year of life (21.7 μg/m3) to the 11th year of life (16.0 μg/m3). The mean PM10 exposure showed a smaller decrease (12.8 -10.7 μg/m3). The statistical analysis showed no significant association between the exposures and either outcome. Conclusions No evidence of a significant association between long-term exposure to PM10 and NO2 and the prevalence of either asthma or wheeze was found.

AB  - Background: Adolescence is a period of change, which coincides with disease remission in a significant proportion of subjects with childhood asthma. There is incomplete understanding of the changing characteristics underlying different adolescent asthma transitions. We undertook pathophysiological characterization of transitional adolescent asthma phenotypes in a longitudinal birth cohort. Methods: The Isle of Wight Birth Cohort (N = 1456) was reviewed at 1, 2, 4, 10 and 18-years. Characterization included questionnaires, skin tests, spirometry, exhaled nitric oxide, bronchial challenge and (in a subset of 100 at 18-years) induced sputum. Asthma groups were "never asthma" (no asthma since birth), "persistent asthma" (asthma at age 10 and 18), "remission asthma" (asthma at age 10 but not at 18) and "adolescent-onset asthma" (asthma at age 18 but not at age 10). Results: Participants whose asthma remitted during adolescence had lower bronchial reactivity (odds ratio (OR) 0.30; CI 0.10 -0.90; p = 0.03) at age 10 plus greater improvement in lung function (forced expiratory flow 25-75% gain: 1.7 L; 1.0-2.9; p = 0.04) compared to persistent asthma by age 18. Male sex (0.3; 0.1-0.7; p < 0.01) and lower acetaminophen use (0.4; 0.2-0.8; p < 0.01) independently favoured asthma remission, when compared to persistent asthma. Asthma remission had a lower total sputum cell count compared to never asthma (31.5 [25-75 centiles] 12.9-40.4) vs. 47.0 (19.5-181.3); p = 0.03). Sputum examination in adolescent-onset asthma showed eosinophilic airway inflammation (3.0%, 0.7-6.6), not seen in persistent asthma (1.0%, 0-3.9), while remission group had the lowest sputum eosinophil count (0.3%, 0-1.4) and lowest eosinophils/neutrophils ratio of 0.0 (Interquartile range: 0.1). Conclusion: Asthma remission during adolescence is associated with lower initial BHR and greater gain in small airways function, while adolescent-onset asthma is primarily eosinophilic.

AB  - Purpose: This study examined the hypothesis that emotion and conduct problems (ECPs) may modify the relationships between ambient air pollutants and childhood asthma and eczema.Methods: In the cross-sectional study, 4209 French schoolchildren (aged 10e12 years) were investigated between March 1999 and October 2000. Ambient air pollutants exposures were estimated with dispersion modeling. Health outcomes and ECPs were evaluated by validated questionnaires, completed by the parents. Marginal models were used to analyze the relationships of exposures to ambient air pollutants and/or ECPs to asthma phenotypes and current eczema, adjusting for potential confounders.Results: In our population, interactions were found between ECPs and exposures to ambient air pollutants (benzene, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter below 10 mm, volatile organic compounds) (P < .20). In addition, ECPs were related to current wheezing (adjusted prevalence odds ratio [aOR], 2.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.59e3.47), current doctor-diagnosed asthma (aOR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.25e2.66), and current eczema (aOR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.61e3.02). Children with ECPs had 1.17e1.51 times higher aORs for the associations between ambient air pollutants and asthma phenotypes and current eczema than those without ECPs.Conclusions: ECPs may modify the relationships between ambient air pollutants and childhood asthma and eczema.

AB  - ABSTRACT BACKGROUND Schools are an ideal setting for implementation of asthma interventions for children; however, sustaining school-based programs can be challenging. This study illustrates policy and practice changes brought about through the Childhood Asthma Linkages in Missouri ( CALM) program to sustain such programs. METHODS Researchers analyzed caregiver-reported quantitative data regarding asthma-related outcomes in preintervention and postintervention surveys and qualitative data regarding sustainability efforts in schools reported by CALM grantees. A grounded theory approach was used to identify key concepts and themes that emerged. RESULTS In 330 children, significant improvements were seen in asthma symptoms, rescue inhaler use, health care utilization, school absenteeism, and activity limitations. Overall, 27 school-based policy and practice changes supporting program sustainability were reported, with policy changes most often concerning the assessment and/or monitoring of children with asthma in the school setting, and practice changes most often regarding institution of regular asthma education programs for students and school personnel. CONCLUSIONS Sustaining school-based asthma programs is challenging, but can be realized through the participation of diverse partners in enacting policy and practice changes that support the institutionalization of programs into the day-to-day processes of the schools.

AB  - ABSTRACT BACKGROUND Childhood asthma is a serious and common chronic disease that requires the attention of nurses and other school personnel. Schools are often the first setting that children take the lead in managing their asthma. Often, children are ill prepared for this role. Our study evaluated a school-based, multifaceted asthma program that targeted students with asthma and the broader school community. METHODS A randomized trial involving 130 schools with grades 1-5 and 1316 children with asthma and their families was conducted. Outcomes of interest for the child, at 1 year, were urgent care use and school absenteeism for asthma, inhaler technique, and quality of life, and for the school, at 14 months, were indicators of a supportive school environment. RESULTS Improvements were observed at the child and school level for the intervention group. Fewer children in the intervention group had a school absence (50% vs 60%; p < .01), required urgent care for asthma (41% vs 51%; p < .0001), or reported a day of interrupted activity (51% vs 63%; p < .01), and had improved quality of life (5.8 ± 1.2 vs 5.4 ± 1.4; p < .0001). Schools in the intervention group were more likely to have practices supporting an asthma-friendly environment. CONCLUSIONS Implementation of a multifaceted school-based asthma program can lead to asthma-friendly schools that support children with asthma to be successful managers of their asthma and experience improved quality of life and decreased disease associated burden.

AB  - ABSTRACT BACKGROUND In Ohio, 14.5% of 5- to 9-year-olds and 17.3% of 10- to 17-year-olds have asthma. Moreover, there is concern that these numbers may underestimate the true disease burden. We sought to evaluate variability in asthma rates and respiratory symptoms among central Ohio fourth graders as a means to assess potential undiagnosed and undertreated asthma and its determinants. METHODS We recruited 13 central Ohio elementary schools representing a broad range of nonurban settings and surveyed fourth graders to estimate school-level physician-diagnosed asthma ( PDA), respiratory morbidity, and home exposures to smoking and pets. We used generalized linear mixed models with random intercept for school to examine relationships among exposures, respiratory symptoms, and PDA. RESULTS Across the 13 schools, 94% of students participated in the survey, and the estimated asthma prevalence rate was 10.2% (N = 101 of 987). An additional 41% reported not having PDA but then went on to report symptoms consistent with asthma potentially suggestive of undiagnosed asthma. Of students with PDA, 21% reported symptoms suggestive of poorly controlled asthma. High levels of secondhand smoke ( SHS) exposure were associated both with PDA (p = .05) and with respiratory symptoms (p < .0001). Students who owned a cat or a bird were more likely to report respiratory symptoms (p = .02 and p = .04, respectively). CONCLUSIONS We provide evidence that the already high childhood asthma public health burden in central Ohio may be underreported. Schools may be an ideal location to conduct screenings and implement environmental interventions oriented toward SHS and household pets that will yield respiratory morbidity benefits.

AB  - This study estimates the effect of maternal infections during pregnancy on childhood asthma. One-thousand four-hundred and twenty-eight pregnant women were prospectively followed using structured interviews and chart review until their child’s 6th year of life. Infections were identified from outpatient and hospital visits. Childhood asthma was defined as physician diagnosis with symptoms at age six. Adjusted odds ratios were calculated from multivariable logistic regression models. Six-hundred and thirty-five women experienced an infection during pregnancy. Among antepartum infections, maternal urinary tract infections were significantly associated with childhood asthma (aOR 1.60, 95 % CI 1.12–2.29). Chorioamnionitis and maternal group beta streptococcus colonization were not significantly associated with an increased risk in childhood asthma. This study found an increased risk of asthma in children of women diagnosed with urinary tract infections during pregnancy, while other maternal infections did not increase the risk.

AB  - Rationale: The burden of asthma is highest among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations; however, its impact is differentially distributed among racial and ethnic groups.Objectives: To assess the collective effect of maternal educational attainment, annual household income, and insurance type on childhood asthma among minority, urban youth.Methods: We included Mexican American (n = 485), other Latino (n = 217), and African American (n = 1,141) children (aged 8-21 yr) with and without asthma from the San Francisco Bay Area. An index was derived from maternal educational attainment, annual household income, and insurance type to assess the collective effect of socioeconomic status on predicting asthma. Logistic regression stratified by racial and ethnic group was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). We further examined whether acculturation explained the socioeconomic-asthma association in our Latino population.Measurements and Main Results: In the adjusted analyses, African American children had 23% greater odds of asthma with each decrease in the socioeconomic index (aOR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.09-1.38). Conversely, Mexican American children have 17% reduced odds of asthma with each decrease in the socioeconomic index (aOR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72-0.96) and this relationship was not fully explained by acculturation. This association was not observed in the other Latino group.Conclusions: Socioeconomic status plays an important role in predicting asthma, but has different effects depending on race and ethnicity. Further steps are necessary to better understand the risk factors through which socioeconomic status could operate in these populations to prevent asthma.

AB  - Background: Childhood asthma has become a critical public health problem because of its high morbidity and increasing prevalence. The impact of nutrition and other exposures during pregnancy on long-term health and development of children has been of increasing interest. Objective: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the association of folate and folic acid intake during pregnancy and risk of asthma and other allergic outcomes in children. Design: We performed a systematic search of 8 electronic databases for articles that examined the association between prenatal folate or folic acid exposure and risk of asthma and other allergic outcomes (eg, allergy, eczema, and atopic dermatitis) in childhood. We performed a meta-analysis by using a random-effects model to derive a summary risk estimate of studies with similar exposure timing, exposure assessment, and outcomes. Results: Our meta-analysis provided no evidence of an association between maternal folic acid supplement use (compared with no use) in the prepregnancy period through the first trimester and asthma in childhood (summary risk estimate: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.30). Because of substantial heterogeneity in exposures and outcomes, it was not possible to generate summary measures for other folate indicators (eg, blood folate concentrations) and asthma or allergy-related outcomes; however, the preponderance of primary risk estimates was not elevated. Conclusions: Our findings do not support an association between periconceptional folic acid supplementation and increased risk of asthma in children. However, because of the limited number and types of studies in the literature, additional research is needed.

AB  - Background: Recent studies have reported an association between maternal use of gastric acid-suppressive drugs during pregnancy and asthma in the offspring, but the association could have been confounded by unmeasured risk factors.Objective: We assessed the association between the use of acid-suppressive drugs during pregnancy and the risk of developing childhood asthma using a bidirectional crossover design.Methods: Mother-infant matched sets in the UK General Practitioners Research Database were used to identify children with a drug-treated asthma diagnosis during the years 2006-2010 who were matched to a sibling without asthma as controls. Primary exposure was use of any anti-suppressive drug during pregnancy, and subgroup analyses were conducted according to drug class (e.g. proton pump inhibitors or histamine 2 receptor antagonists) and trimester. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) with their corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CIs).Results: A total of 1,874 children with asthma and 1,874 control siblings were included in the analysis. The exposure rate among case and control pregnancies was 22 and 20 %, respectively. After adjustments for gender, birth order, mother's age and general practice visits, the exposure to any gastric-acid suppressive drug during pregnancy slightly increased the risk for developing asthma (OR 1.23, 95 % CI 1.01-1.51; p = 0.042). A trend towards increased risks was observed for those who used proton pump inhibitors and/or histamine 2 receptor antagonists (adjusted OR 1.72, 95 % CI 1.00-2.98; p = 0.048).Conclusions: These findings lend support to the emerging evidence that exposure to acid-suppressive drugs during pregnancy is associated with childhood asthma. More basic research is now warranted to investigate the mechanisms.

AB  - Objective: Increasing childhood asthma rates may be due to changing dietary lifestyle. We investigated the association of dietary intake of antioxidant vitamins and fatty acids with asthma in Japanese pre-school children.Design: Cross-sectional study.Setting: School-based survey on lifestyle/diet and health status in children in Japan.Subjects: Parents of 452 children aged 3-6 years completed a questionnaire on the children's and parents’ lifestyle and demographics. Children were classified into asthma cases and non-asthma cases in accordance with the ATS-DLD(American Thoracic Society and Division of Lung Diseases of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute) questionnaire. Children's diet was assessed using a 3 d dietary record completed by parents. Children's age, sex, BMI, history of food allergy, maternal age, parental history of allergy, maternal education,family size and second-hand smoking were included as covariates. Logistic regression models were used to examine the association between children's diet and asthma.Results: Compared with children with the lowest intake tertile for vitamin C and vitamin E, those in the highest were significantly inversely associated with asthma; adjusted OR (95% CI) were 0?35 (0?14, 0?88) and 0?32 (0?12, 0?85),respectively. A statistically significant trend was also observed. Fruit intake showed an inverse but insignificant association with asthma. There were no associations of any type of fatty acids with asthma.Conclusions: These data suggest that children with high intakes of vitamins C and E may be associated with a reduced prevalence of asthma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is a risk factor for asthma. Importantly, cigarette smoke can decrease the adherence of epithelial cells and increase detachment. The adhesion molecule E-cadherin (CDH1) has an essential role in the formation of epithelial junction. Turnover of the extracellular matrix, which is characterized by airway remodeling, depends on the imbalance between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMPs). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of ETS exposure and CDH1, MMP-3, and TIMP-1 genetic polymorphisms on childhood asthma. METHODS: The CDH1 C-160A, MMP-3 -1171, and TIMP-1 T372C genotypes were identified by polymerase chain reaction in 299 asthmatic children and 383 healthy controls. RESULTS: More ETS exposure (>5 vs 0 cigarettes/day; odds ratio [OR], 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-2.01) and the presence of CDH1 AA/CA genotypes (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.08-2.17) were associated with childhood asthma. Compared with children with less ETS exposure (0-5 cigarettes/day) and the CDH1 CC genotype, those with less ETS exposure and the CDH1 AA/CA genotypes and those with more ETS exposure and the CDH1 CC genotype had a moderate risk of asthma. The greatest risk for asthma was in children with more ETS exposure and the CDH1 AA/CA genotypes (OR, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.81-5.06), and this interaction between CDH1 polymorphism and ETS exposure was significant. In addition, asthma cases with more ETS exposure or the CDH1 AA/CA genotypes had obviously increased eosinophil counts. CONCLUSION: Susceptible CDH1 genotypes might modulate the development of asthma, especially for children exposed to ETS.

AB  - Objective: To examine temporal trends in the US incidence of childhood asthma hospitalizations, in-hospital mortality, mechanical ventilation use, and hospital charges between 2000 and 2009.Study Design: This was a serial, cross-sectional analysis of a nationally representative sample of children hospitalized with acute asthma. The Kids Inpatient Database was used to identify children aged <18 years with asthma by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code 493.xx. Outcome measures were asthma hospitalization incidence, in-hospital mortality, mechanical ventilation use, and hospital charges. We examined temporal trends of each outcome, accounting for sampling weights. Hospital charges were adjusted for inflation to 2009 US dollars.Results: The 4 separate years (2000, 2003, 2006, and 2009) of national discharge data included a total of 592805 weighted discharges with asthma. Between 2000 and 2009, the rate of asthma hospitalization in US children decreased from 21.1 to 18.4 per 10000 person-years (13% decrease; Ptrend < .001). Mortality declined significantly after adjusting for confounders (OR for comparison of 2009 with 2000, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.17-0.79). In contrast, there was an increase in the use of mechanical ventilation (from 0.8% to 1.0%, a 28% increase; Ptrend < .001). Nationwide hospital charges also increased from $1.27 billion to $1.59 billion (26% increase; Ptrend < .001); this increase was driven by a rise in the geometric mean of hospital charges per discharge, from $5940 to $8410 (42% increase; Ptrend < .001).Conclusion: Between 2000 and 2009, we found significant declines in asthma hospitalization and in-hospital mortality among US children. In contrast, mechanical ventilation use and hospital charges for asthma increased significantly over this same period.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the effect of extreme temperatures on emergency department admissions (EDAs) for childhood asthma. METHODS: An ecological design was used in this study. A Poisson linear regression model combined with a distributed lag non-linear model was used to quantify the effect of temperature on EDAs for asthma among children aged 0-14 years in Brisbane, Australia, during January 2003-December 2009, while controlling for air pollution, relative humidity, day of the week, season and long-term trends. The model residuals were checked to identify whether there was an added effect due to heat waves or cold spells. RESULTS: There were 13 324 EDAs for childhood asthma during the study period. Both hot and cold temperatures were associated with increases in EDAs for childhood asthma, and their effects both appeared to be acute. An added effect of heat waves on EDAs for childhood asthma was observed, but no added effect of cold spells was found. Male children and children aged 0-4 years were most vulnerable to heat effects, while children aged 10-14 years were most vulnerable to cold effects. CONCLUSIONS: Both hot and cold temperatures seemed to affect EDAs for childhood asthma. As climate change continues, children aged 0-4 years are at particular risk for asthma.

AB  - Rationale: Air pollution is a known asthma trigger and has been associated with short-term asthma symptoms, airway inflammation, decreased lung function, and reduced response to asthma rescue medications.Objectives: To assess a causal relationship between air pollution and childhood asthma using data that address temporality by estimating air pollution exposures before the development of asthma and to establish the generalizability of the association by studying diverse racial/ethnic populations in different geographic regions.Methods: This study included Latino (n = 3,343) and African American (n = 977) participants with and without asthma from five urban regions in the mainland United States and Puerto Rico. Residential history and data from local ambient air monitoring stations were used to estimate average annual exposure to five air pollutants: ozone, nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), sulfur dioxide, particulate matter not greater than 10 μm in diameter, and particulate matter not greater than 2.5 μm in diameter. Within each region, we performed logistic regression to determine the relationship between early-life exposure to air pollutants and subsequent asthma diagnosis. A random-effects model was used to combine the region-specific effects and generate summary odds ratios for each pollutant.Measurements and Main Results: After adjustment for confounders, a 5-ppb increase in average NO₂ during the first year of life was associated with an odds ratio of 1.17 for physician-diagnosed asthma (95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.31).Conclusions: Early-life NO₂ exposure is associated with childhood asthma in Latinos and African Americans. These results add to a growing body of evidence that traffic-related pollutants may be causally related to childhood asthma.

AB  - Pediatric asthma is a disease that is managed across outpatient physicians, hospitalists, critical care physicians, and emergency department (ED) physicians. Scoring systems may facilitate a rapid assessment of the child with asthma in the ED. Short-acting beta agonists are still the mainstay of therapy for acute exacerbations along with corticosteroids and ipratropium bromide. ED providers must also know the indications for noninvasive ventilation and intubation. Most patients can be treated and discharged from the ED after acute exacerbation, and should be given a plan for going home that provides educational material and emergency scenarios to help prevent future acute incidents.

AB  - To assess the impact of parental asthma on risk of pre-term birth (PTB) and intrauterine growth restriction, and their subsequent association with childhood asthma. Three sequential cross-sectional surveys were conducted in 1993 (3,746), 1998 (1,964) and 2006 (1,074) in the same 15 schools among 5-11 year old children in Merseyside using the same respiratory health questionnaire completed by parents (sample size in brackets). Between 1993 and 2006, prevalence of PTB varied between 12.4 and 15.2 %, and of small for gestational age (SGA or growth restricted) babies between 2.1 and 4.6 %, and maternal asthma prevalence between 8.1 and 13.4 %. For the combined surveys mothers with asthma were more likely to have a PTB than non-asthmatic mothers (OR 1.39, 95 % CI 1.10-1.95, p < 0.001), and in the 2006 survey were more likely to have an SGA baby. 40.9 % of PTBs of asthmatic mothers developed doctor diagnosed asthma compared to 34.3 % for term babies (adjusted OR 1.65, 1.34-2.04, p < 0.001). The corresponding estimates for the symptom triad of cough, wheeze and breathlessness were 19.4 and 17.6 % (adjusted OR 1.78, 0.79-3.98). Conversely SGA babies were less likely to develop doctor diagnosed asthma (adjusted OR 0.49, 0.27-0.90, p < 0.021), or the symptom triad of cough, wheeze and breathlessness (adjusted OR 0.22, 0.05-0.97, p < 0.043), whether or not the mother was asthmatic. Maternal asthma is an independent risk factor for PTB which predisposes to childhood asthma. Intrauterine growth restriction was protective against childhood asthma.

AB  - Background: Hypoxia (Hx) is an important disease mechanism in prematurity, childhood asthma, and obesity. In children, Hx results in chronic inflammation.Methods: We investigated the effects of Hx (12% O2) during postnatal days 2-20 in rats. Control groups were normoxic control (Nc), and normoxic growth restricted (Gr) (14-pup litters).Results: The Hx-exposed and Gr rats had similar decreases in growth. Hx increased plasma tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels and decreased insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. Hx resulted in hypertrophy of the right ventricle (RV) but disproportionate decrements in limb skeletal muscle (SM) growth. miR-206 was depressed in the hypertrophied RV of Hx rats but was increased in growth-retarded SM. Hx resulted in decreased RV messenger RNA (mRNA) level for myostatin but had no effect on SM myostatin. The mRNA for Hx-sensitive factors such as hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) was depressed in the RV of Hx rats, suggesting negative feedback.Conclusion: The results indicate that Hx induces a proinflammatory state that depresses growth-regulating mechanisms and that tissues critical for survival, such as the heart, can escape from this general regulatory program to sustain life. This study identifies accessible biomarkers for evaluating the impact of interventions designed to mitigate the long-term deleterious consequences of Hx that all too often occur in babies born prematurely.

AB  - Rationale: Innate immune responses marked by increases in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α have been associated with asthma but whether such alterations are evident before symptoms is not yet clear.Objectives: To determine if prevalence of childhood asthma or asthma-related traits is predicted by perinatal innate immune status and if maternal factors related to pregnancy influence asthma prevalence and innate immune status.Methods: In the Tucson Infant Immune Study (a nonselected birth cohort), presence of eczema and wheezing in the child's first year and physician-diagnosed asthma through age 9 and asthma in the parents was obtained from parent-completed questionnaires. TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-12 were measured in supernatants of LPS-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells at birth and 3 months as was TNF-α in plasma. TNF-α single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped by Sequenom. Percent predicted FEV1/FVC was measured at age 9. Maternal weight gain during pregnancy and prepregnancy weight were ascertained from medical records.Measurements and Main Results: Infants with persistently elevated LPS-induced TNF-α at birth and 3 months were at increased risk for childhood asthma (odds ratio [OR], 4.1; confidence interval [CI], 1.9-8.8; n = 233; P = 0.0003) and had decreased FEV1/FVC ratios at age 9. Children with mothers in the top tertile for pregnancy weight gain had increased risk for asthma (OR, 3.4; CI, 1.7-6.9; n = 225; P = 0.001) and persistently elevated TNF-α in early life (OR, 2.9; CI, 1.4-8.2; n = 195; P = 0.013). These relations were independent of maternal asthma and rhinitis.Conclusions: Persistently elevated LPS-induced TNF-α production early in life acts as a predictive biomarker for childhood asthma, and excess pregnancy weight gain in the mother seems to contribute to both.

AB  - Background: Puerto Ricans share a disproportionate burden of childhood asthma in the United States. Little is known about the impact of low parental numeracy (a health literacy skill) on asthma morbidity in Puerto Rican children. Our objective was to examine whether low parental numeracy is associated with increased asthma morbidity in Puerto Rican children.Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 351 children with asthma, aged 6 to 14 years, living in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Parents of study participants completed a modified version of the Asthma Numeracy Questionnaire. Multivariate linear or logistic regression was used to examine the relation between low parental numeracy (defined as no correct answers in the modified Asthma Numeracy Questionnaire) and indicators of asthma morbidity (severe asthma exacerbations, core measures of asthma exacerbations, and lung function measures). All multivariate models were adjusted for age, sex, household income, reported use of inhaled corticosteroids in the previous 6 months, and exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke.Results: Low parental numeracy was associated with increased odds of visits to the ED or urgent care for asthma (adjusted OR [aOR]=1.7, 95% CI=1.03-2.7, P=.04). The association between low parental numeracy and hospitalizations for asthma was significant only among children not using inhaled corticosteroids (aOR=2.8, 95% CI=1.4-5.6, P=.004). There was no association between low parental numeracy and use of systemic steroids or lung function measures.Conclusions: Low parental numeracy is associated with increased asthma morbidity in Puerto Rican children.

AB  - The prevalence of childhood asthma has increased recently. The aim of this study was to assess the epidemiology of asthma and risk factors for hospital admission among children attending the outpatient and emergency clinic in a university hospital in Sohag, Egypt. The prevalence of asthma over a 6-month period among children aged 3-12 years at this hospital was 1.4% (178/12 612). All the asthmatic children were enrolled in an observational, prospective questionnaire study. More of the asthmatics were males, living in rural areas, with recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, passive exposure to tobacco smoke and suffering attacks at night time; 38 children (21.3%) needed hospital admission for asthma. In multivariate regression analysis, significant risk factors for hospital admission were: both cough and dyspnoea as presenting symptoms; using prophylactic therapy; and complaining of continuous symptoms (during both day and night). Proper use of prophylactic therapies is recommended for better outcomes in our asthmatic children.

AB  - Aim: The rising prevalence of bronchial asthma has led to world-wide efforts to understand and stem this development. Cross-sectional studies appear to show that early childhood use of antibiotics may be an important contributory factor, with paracetamol as an additional suspected cause. However, mounting evidence, which is reviewed here, points to various confounding factors as the major reasons for these reported associations. Methods: PubMed and EMBASE were systematically searched for studies on associations between antibiotics and/or paracetamol with asthma and/or wheezing, published up to November 2012. A total of 64 pertinent studies were identified, 35 focusing on antibiotics, 19 on paracetamol, and ten addressing both antibiotics and paracetamol, bringing the number of relevant datasets to 74. Results: Numerous studies were cross-sectional and made no adjustment for the indication of antibiotics or paracetamol; consequently, they were unable to dismiss possible confounding by indication. Where such adjustments could be performed (mostly in longitudinal studies), they substantially weakened or entirely eliminated the association with asthma or asthma surrogates present in the unadjusted data. Conclusion: The weight of evidence of the collected studies in our review strongly suggests that the association of antibiotics with childhood asthma reflects various forms of bias, the most prominent of which is confounding by indication. Recent studies and meta-analyses support the same conclusion for paracetamol. Truly indicated antibiotics should not be withheld from infants or young children for fears they might develop asthma. Likewise, there is no sound reason to replace paracetamol as the preferred pain relief and fever medication in this age group.

AB  - An asthma exacerbation can be a life-threatening experience. This project tested the effectiveness of using a prompting form to improve childhood asthma care. Thirty randomly selected charts without a prompt form in a pediatric practice were compared for differences with thirty randomly selected charts with a completed prompting form. The number of medications reviewed (p =.001) and the frequency of refills written (p =.024) were significantly higher in the prompt group. Education was higher (p =.000) and triggers were more frequently discussed in the prompt group. The use of a prompting form facilitates discussion and improves preventive asthma care.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Remodeling and inflammation together with airway hyperresponsiveness are essential components of asthma but their role in development of the disease is still obscure. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent data imply that remodeling can occur early in childhood, not necessarily subsequent to but rather, in parallel with inflammation. The assumption of thickening of the reticular basement membrane being a prerequirement for chronic asthma is questioned but development of airway responsiveness is a significant factor. Airway responsiveness is at least partially linked to bronchial inflammation but there are several other genes and pathways regulating airway responsiveness. Increased airway smooth muscle in early childhood is associated with later development of asthma and may be one link between inflammation and airway responsiveness. Novel findings on genetic variation in genes regulating lung growth and remodeling in early childhood shed light on the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to chronic asthma. SUMMARY: Even young children with chronic asthma have detectable elements of airway remodeling, inflammation and increased airway responsiveness, which all contribute to impaired lung function.

AB  - Background: Urban landscape elements, particularly trees, have the potential to affect airflow, air quality, and production of aeroallergens. Several large-scale urban tree planting projects have sought to promote respiratory health, yet evidence linking tree cover to human health is limited. Objectives: We sought to investigate the association of tree canopy cover with subsequent development of childhood asthma, wheeze, rhinitis, and allergic sensitization. Methods: Birth cohort study data were linked to detailed geographic information systems data characterizing 2001 tree canopy coverage based on LiDAR (light detection and ranging) and multispectral imagery within 0.25 km of the prenatal address. A total of 549 Dominican or African-American children born in 1998-2006 had outcome data assessed by validated questionnaire or based on IgE antibody response to specific allergens, including a tree pollen mix. Results: Tree canopy coverage did not significantly predict outcomes at 5 years of age, but was positively associated with asthma and allergic sensitization at 7 years. Adjusted risk ratios (RRs) per standard deviation of tree canopy coverage were 1.17 for asthma (95% CI: 1.02, 1.33), 1.20 for any specific allergic sensitization (95% CI: 1.05, 1.37), and 1.43 for tree pollen allergic sensitization (95% CI: 1.19, 1.72). Conclusions: Results did not support the hypothesized protective association of urban tree canopy coverage with asthma or allergy-related outcomes. Tree canopy cover near the prenatal address was associated with higher prevalence of allergic sensitization to tree pollen. Information was not available on sensitization to specific tree species or individual pollen exposures, and results may not be generalizable to other populations or geographic area

AB  - Background: Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) are ubiquitous pollutants. Experimental data suggest that they may be associated with adverse health outcomes, including asthma. However, there is little supporting epidemiological evidence. Methods: A total of 231 asthmatic children and 225 nonasthmatic controls, all from northern Taiwan, were recruited in the Genetic and Biomarkers study for Childhood Asthma. Structure questionnaires were administered by face-to-face interview. Serum concentrations of 11 PFCs and levels of immunological markers were also measured. Associations of PFC quartiles with concentrations of immunological markers and asthma outcomes were estimated using multivariable regression models. Results: Nine PFCs were detectable in most children (≥ 84.4%), of which perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the most abundant (median serum concentrations of 33.9 ng/mL in asthmatics and 28.9 ng/mL in controls). Adjusted odds ratios for asthma among those with the highest versus lowest quartile of PFC exposure ranged from 1.81 (95% CI: 1.02, 3.23) for the perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA) to 4.05 (95% CI: 2.21, 7.42) for perfluorooctanic acid (PFOA). PFOS, PFOA, and subsets of the other PFCs were positively associated with serum IgE concentrations, absolute eosinophil counts (AEC), eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) concentrations, and asthma severity scores among asthmatics. Conclusions: This study suggests an association between PFC exposure and juvenile asthma. Because of widespread exposure to these chemicals, these findings may be of potential public health concern.

AB  - Background: Obesity and asthma have increased in westernised countries. Maternal obesity may increase childhood asthma risk. If this relation is causal, it may be mediated through factors associated with maternal adiposity, such as fetal development, pregnancy complications or infant adiposity. We investigated the relationships of maternal body mass index (BMI) and fat mass with childhood wheeze, and examined the influences of infant weight gain and childhood obesity.Methods: Maternal prepregnancy BMI and estimated fat mass (from skinfold thicknesses) were related to asthma, wheeze and atopy in 940 children. Transient or persistent/late wheeze was classified using questionnaire data collected at ages 6, 12, 24 and 36 months and 6 years. At 6 years, skin-prick testing was conducted and exhaled nitric oxide and spirometry measured. Infant adiposity gain was calculated from skinfold thickness at birth and 6 months.Results: Greater maternal BMI and fat mass were associated with increased childhood wheeze (relative risk (RR) 1.08 per 5 kg/m(2), p=0.006; RR 1.09 per 10 kg, p=0.003); these reflected associations with transient wheeze (RR 1.11, p=0.003; RR 1.13, p=0.002, respectively), but not with persistent wheeze or asthma. Infant adiposity gain was associated with persistent wheeze, but not significantly. Adjusting for infant adiposity gain or BMI at 3 or 6 years did not reduce the association between maternal adiposity and transient wheeze. Maternal adiposity was not associated with offspring atopy, exhaled nitric oxide, or spirometry.Discussion: Greater maternal adiposity is associated with transient wheeze but not asthma or atopy, suggesting effects upon airway structure/function but not allergic predisposition.

AB  - Rationale: Epigenetic and/or genetic variation in the gene encoding the receptor for adenylate-cyclase activating polypeptide 1 (ADCYAP1R1) has been linked to post-traumatic stress disorder in adults and anxiety in children. Psychosocial stress has been linked to asthma morbidity in Puerto Rican children.Objectives: To examine whether epigenetic or genetic variation in ADCYAP1R1 is associated with childhood asthma in Puerto Ricans.Methods: We conducted a case-control study of 516 children ages 6-14 years living in San Juan, Puerto Rico. We assessed methylation at a CpG site in the promoter of ADCYAP1R1 (cg11218385) using a pyrosequencing assay in DNA from white blood cells. We tested whether cg11218385 methylation (range, 0.4-6.1%) is associated with asthma using logistic regression. We also examined whether exposure to violence (assessed by the Exposure to Violence [ETV] Scale in children 9 yr and older) is associated with cg11218385 methylation (using linear regression) or asthma (using logistic regression). Logistic regression was used to test for association between a single nucleotide polymorphism in ADCYAP1R1 (rs2267735) and asthma under an additive model. All multivariate models were adjusted for age, sex, household income, and principal components.Measurements and Main Results: EACH 1% increment in cg11218385 methylation was associated with increased odds of asthma (adjusted odds ratio, 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.6; P = 0.03). Among children 9 years and older, exposure to violence was associated with cg11218385 methylation. The C allele of single nucleotide polymorphism rs2267735 was significantly associated with increased odds of asthma (adjusted odds ratio, 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.67; P = 0.03).Conclusions: Epigenetic and genetic variants in ADCYAP1R1 are associated with asthma in Puerto Rican children.

AB  - Rationale: Bacterial colonization of neonatal airways with the pathogenic bacterial species, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, is associated with later development of childhood asthma. Objectives: To study a possible association between colonization with pathogenic bacterial strains and the immune signature of the upper airways in healthy neonates. Methods: A total of 20 cytokines and chemokines were quantified in vivo in the airway mucosal lining fluid of 662 neonates from the Copenhagen Prospective Study of Asthma in Childhood 2010 birth cohort. Colonization of the hypopharynx with M. catarrhalis, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus was assessed simultaneously. The association between immune signatures and bacterial colonization or noncolonized controls was analyzed using conventional statistical methods supplemented by a multivariate approach for pattern identification. Measurements and Main Results: Colonization with M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae induced a mixed T helper cell (Th) type 1/Th2/Th17 response with high levels of IL-1[beta] (M. catarrhalis, P = 2.2 x 10(-12); H. influenzae, P = 7.1 x 10(-10)), TNF-[alpha] (M. catarrhalis, P = 1.5 x 10(-9); H. influenzae, P = 5.9 x 10(-7)), and macrophage inflammatory protein-1[beta] (M. catarrhalis, P = 1.6 x 10(-11); H. influenzae, P = 2.7 x 10(-7)). S. aureus colonization demonstrated a Th17-promoting profile with elevated IL-17 levels (P = 1.6 x 10(-24)). S. pneumoniae colonization was not significantly associated with any of the mediators. Conclusions: M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae colonization of the airways of asymptomatic neonates is associated with an inflammatory immune response of the airway mucosa, which may result in chronic inflammation.

AB  - In recent decades there have been marked increases in asthma prevalence in Western countries. More recently, asthma prevalence has peaked, or even begun to decline, in Western countries, but many low and middle income countries are now beginning to experience increases in prevalence (although there is no evidence of increases in prevalence in India to date). "Established" risk factors for asthma cannot account for the global prevalence increases, or the international patterns that have been observed, or the recent declines in prevalence in some Western countries. It seems that as a result of the "package" of changes in the intrauterine and infant environment that are occurring with "Westernization", we are seeing an increased susceptibility to the development of asthma and/or allergy. There are a number of elements of this "package" including changes in maternal diet, increased fetal growth, smaller family size, reduced infant infections and increased use of antibiotics and paracetamol, and immunization, all of which have been (inconsistently) associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma, but none of which can alone explain the increases in prevalence. It is likely that the "package" is more than the sum of its parts, and that these social and environmental changes are all pushing the infants' immune systems towards an increased risk of asthma.

AB  - Objective: To identify the predictive factors of early childhood wheezing in children of low socioeconomic status.Study Design: The Childhood Asthma Prevention Study enrolled 177 low-income children (9-24 months old) with frequent wheezing. At age 7 years, presence of asthma was assessed through caregiver reports of physician diagnosis of asthma (CRPDA) and corroborated by assessment of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR). Lung function, inflammatory markers, and asthma symptom severity were compared for children with ±CRPDA, ±BHR, and asthma. Baseline predictors for CRPDA, BHR, and asthma at 7 years of age were examined.Results: Maternal symptom report strongly differentiated children with +CRPDA (49%) despite comparable airflow measurements (P < .0001), and spirometric lung function measurements were different for +BHR (65%) versus -BHR (P < .005). Univariate analyses revealed different baseline predictors of +CRPDA and +BHR for children at age 7 years. Higher levels of maternal psychological resources were associated with +CRPDA, but not +BHR. Only 39% of children with a history of frequent wheezing met the conservative definition of asthma at age 7 years, with the following significant predictors found: low birth weight, baseline symptom severity, and maternal psychological resources.Conclusions: This low-income, multi-ethnic group of wheezing infants represents a unique population of children with distinct characteristics and risks for persistent asthma. Determination of asthma status at 7 years of age required objective measurement of BHR in addition to CRPDA. The association of maternal psychological resources with +CRPDA may represent a previously unrecognized factor in the determination of asthma status among low-income groups.

AB  - Using data from a large cohort of urban children, this study identified multilevel correlates of asthma to determine whether neighborhood attributes remain associated with asthma after adjustment for individual level and immediate housing characteristics. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from the Fragile Families and Child Well-being Study and its substudy, the In-Home Longitudinal Study of Pre-Schooled Age Children (n = 1,784). The primary outcome was asthma diagnosis by age 5. Sociodemographic measures were assessed via telephone survey, housing and block conditions recorded via direct observation, and neighborhood characteristics came from geocoded census tract data. After multivariable adjustment, non-Hispanic Black, Puerto Rican, or other Hispanic race, child's lack of insurance coverage, male gender, presence of allergies, the exterior condition of a child's home, mother's educational attainment, and the percent of the neighborhood population with a bachelor's degree remained significantly associated with having received an asthma diagnosis by age 5. The authors identified sociodemographic and economic factors at the individual, household, and neighborhood level which are correlates of childhood asthma in urban areas. After adjustment for more proximal characteristics, the effects of all neighborhood markers were minimal, with the exception of neighborhood education.

AB  - Background: Bronchial asthma is one of the most prevalent diseases in Arab children. Environmental pollution has been suggested to be considered causative of asthma, nasal symptoms and bronchitis in both children and adult. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the association between serum polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) levels, asthma and allergic outcomes among Saudi children aged up to 15 yrs. We hypothesized that increased serum PAHs are associated with allergy, asthma, or respiratory symptoms. Methods: A total of 195 Saudi children (98 asthma pediatric patients and 97 healthy controls) were randomly selected from the Riyadh Cohort Study for inclusion. The diagnosis of Asthma was based on established pediatric diagnosis and medications taken. Results: Asthma related markers showed highly significant differences between children with and without asthma. Thus IgE, resistin and IL-4 were significantly increased (p 0.004, 0.001 and 0.003, respectively) in children with asthma compared with non-asthma control subjects. GMCSF, IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-8 and IL-10, on the other hand, were significantly decreased in children with asthma (p 0.003, 0.03, 0.001, 0.004 and 0.03, respectively). Strong associations between serum PAHs levels and biomarkers of childhood asthma were detected in Arabic children. Data confirmed the role of naphthalene, 4H-cyclobenta[def]phenanthrene, 1,2-benzanthracene, chrysene and benzo(e)acephenanthrylene in childhood asthma; levels of these PAHs were correlated with asthma related biomarkers including IgE, resistin, GMCSF and IFN-γ as well as IL-4, IL-5, IL-8 and IL-10 cytokines. Conclusions: This data highlight the pivotal role of specific PAHs in childhood asthma.

AB  - Objective. Childhood asthma is a frequent cause of absenteeism that affects school performance. We aimed to investigate the impact of asthma on absenteeism and school performance level of elementary and high school students. Methods. Data about sociodemographics, absenteeism, and academic achievement were obtained from 1539 students attending 98 schools in Greece. School performance was assessed for the last two years of school attendance using parents' and teachers' reports and grade point average promotion. Results. The mean of the days of absence of students with asthma was higher compared to the healthy students (6.2 ± 11.7 versus 0.3 ± 3.1, resp., P < 0.001). Students with reduced healthcare use presented less absenteeism than those with increased healthcare use for asthma (4.3 ± 8.6 versus 12.4 ± 17.0 days, resp., P < 0.001). Asthma and healthcare use for asthma accounted for an overall estimated variability in absence days of 13.8% and 9%, respectively. Absenteeism was associated with poor school performance for the last two years of school (P = 0.002) and with lower grade point promotion in elementary school students (P = 0.001) but not in high school students (P = 0.316). Higher level of parental education was associated with better school performance (P < 0.001). Asthma was associated with a decreased possibility for excellent performance (OR = 0.64, P = 0.049, 95%CI = 0.41-1.00) in elementary students. Students with asthma using inhalers were four times more likely to perform excellently in elementary school (OR = 4.3, P = 0.028, 95%CI = 1.17-15.95) than their asthmatic peers with alternative asthma treatments. Conclusions. Asthma and increased healthcare use enhance school absenteeism. Inhaled steroid use and the higher parental education level were the most important predicting factors for good school performance in elementary school asthmatic children.

AB  - Background: Asthma is the most common chronic childhood illness, with rapidly increasing prevalence in low-income countries. Among young children, asthma is often under-diagnosed.We investigated the factors associated with asthma among under-fives presenting with acute respiratory symptoms at Mulago hospital, Uganda. Methods: A hospital-based cross sectional study of 614 children with cough and/or difficult breathing, and fast breathing, was conducted between August 2011 and June 2012. A questionnaire focusing on clinical history of the child was administered to the caretakers. A physical examination and, laboratory and radiological investigations were done. Asthma was defined according to GINA (Global Initiative for Asthma) guidelines which were modified by excluding the symptom of "chest tightness", spirometry/peak expiratory flow measurements and by adding chest x-ray findings to distinguish asthma from pneumonia. A panel of three paediatricians reviewed the participants' case reports and, guided by the study definitions, made a diagnosis of asthma or other. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was done to determine factors independently associated with asthma. Results: Of the 614 children, 128 (20.8%) had asthma, 125 (20.4%) bronchiolitis, 167 (27.2%) bacterial pneumonia only, 163 (26.5%) viral pneumonia while 31 (5.1%) had other diagnoses including pulmonary tuberculosis. The majority (71.1%) of children with asthma were aged ≥ 12 months. Factors associated with asthma included maternal asthma (AOR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2, 4.6), a history of allergy in the patient (AOR 2.6, 95% CI 1.2, 5.4,), use of gas for cooking (AOR 3.8, 95% CI 1.2, 13.3), prematurity (AOR 9.3, 95% CI 1.2, 83.3) and high level of education of caretaker (AOR 9.1, 95% CI 1.1, 72.8). Conclusion: Maternal asthma, a history of allergy in the patient, use of gas for cooking, prematurity and high level of education of caretaker were significantly associated with asthma. There is need for studies to explore the role of the above factors in development and exacerbation of childhood asthma to provide information that can be used to design strategies for asthma prevention and control.

AB  - Background: Asthma is a worldwide problem. It cannot be prevented or cured, but it is possible, at least in principle, to control asthma with modern management. Control usually is assessed by history of symptoms, physical examination, and measurement of lung function. A practical problem is that these measures of control may not be in agreement. The aim of this study was to describe agreement among different measures of asthma control in children.Methods: A prospective sequential sample of children aged 4 to 11 years with atopic asthma attending a routine follow-up evaluation were studied. Patients were assessed with the following four steps: (1) fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), (2) spirometry, (3) Childhood Asthma Control Test (cACT), and (4) conventional clinical assessment by a pediatrician. The outcome for each test was coded as controlled or uncontrolled asthma. Agreement among measures was examined by cross-tabulation and κ statistics.Results: Eighty children were enrolled, and nine were excluded. Mean FENO in pediatrician-judged uncontrolled asthma was double that of controlled asthma (37 parts per billion vs 15 parts per billion, P < .005). There was disagreement among measures of control. Spirometric indices revealed some correlation, but of the unrelated comparisons, those that agreed with each other most often (69%) were clinical assessment by the pediatrician and the cACT. Worst agreement was noted for FENO and cACT (49.3%).Conclusion: Overall, different measures to assess control of asthma showed a lack of agreement for all comparisons in this study.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is common in children with asthma and may be present with or without symptoms. Clinicians, influenced by position statements in national guidelines, have routinely treated children with poorly controlled asthma with various anti-GERD medications. This practice is based on the pervasive but unproven belief that GERD is an important determinant of poor asthma control. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical studies show that GERD is highly prevalent in children with asthma, with estimates as high as 80%, but nearly half of the children are asymptomatic. However, there is no conclusive evidence per se that asymptomatic GERD informs asthma control, and treatment of GERD in the few controlled trials available for review does not substantively improve asthma outcomes. In a recent large controlled clinical trial, treatment with a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) was not only ineffective, but adverse effects were common, including an increased prevalence of symptomatic respiratory infections. SUMMARY: Current evidence does not support the routine use of anti-GERD medications in the treatment of poorly controlled asthma of childhood. However large controlled trials of children symptomatic of both GERD and asthma have not been conducted, and in this case the benefits of treatment, although unproven, might outweigh the risks.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Asthma morbidity in children remains high despite comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for evaluation and treatment. The objective of this review is to examine the evidence that obstructive sleep-disordered breathing often co-exists with asthma and is associated with asthma severity, and to discuss the clinical implications of this relationship, focusing particularly on studies published within the past year. RECENT FINDINGS: Obstructive sleep-disordered breathing is highly prevalent in children with severe or poorly controlled asthma. Data from an observational study suggest that adenotonsillectomy markedly improves asthma outcomes in children with poorly controlled asthma and comorbid obstructive sleep apnea. SUMMARY: Clinicians should consider evaluating and treating obstructive sleep-disordered breathing in children with severe or difficult-to-control asthma. Further controlled studies are needed to confirm that treatment of obstructive sleep apnea improves pediatric asthma outcomes, and to extend our understanding of how asthma and sleep-disordered breathing interact.

AB  - Background Epidemiological studies show that vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are common worldwide and associated with many diseases including asthma. Our aim was to evaluate vitamin D insufficiency and its clinical consequences. Methods This cross-sectional study was carried out on 170 children consisted of 85 who were asthmatic and 85 who were not, aged 2 to 14 years in Tekirdag, Turkey, from September 2009 to May 2010. Children's basal serum D vitamin levels were determined, and their eating habits, vitamin D intake, exposure to sunlight and use of health services during the previous year were investigated. The severity of asthma and levels of asthma control were assessed according to the Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines. Results The difference between mean vitamin D levels in the asthmatic group (mean +/− SD) 16.6 +/− 8.5 ng/mL and the healthy control group (mean +/− SD) 28.2 +/− 19.5 ng/mL was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.001). Children in the asthma group had less exposure to sunlight and ate a diet less rich in vitamin D (p < 0.001). A significant difference was observed between the groups regarding the frequency of respiratory tract infections leading to emergency unit admissions and number of hospitalizations (p < 0.001). It was also shown that a decrease in vitamin D level increased the severity of asthma (p < 0.001) and decreased the frequency of controlled asthma (p = 0.010). Conclusion This study has demonstrated the correlation between plasma 25 (OH) D levels and childhood asthma. Evidently, this relationship being influenced by multiple factors other than vitamin D, further studies should be conducted to explore the interrelation between all such factors.

AB  - The epidemic of childhood allergic disorders has been associated to the decline of infectious disease. However, exposure to many triggers (airborne viruses, tobacco smoke, pollution, indoor allergens, etc.) contribute to the disease. Breast feeding practices, nutrition, dietary and obesity also play a multifaceted role in shaping the observed worldwide trends of childhood allergies. Guidelines for treatment are available, but their implementation is suboptimal. Then developed countries are slowing learning integrating the development of suitable guidelines with implementation plans. Awareness, psychosocial and family factors strongly influence asthma and food allergy control. Moreover, monitoring tools are necessary to facilitate self-management. By taking into consideration these and many other pragmatic aspects, national public health programs to control the allergic epidemic have been successful in reducing its impact and trace the need for future research in the area.

AB  - Abstract: There are marked ethnic and socioeconomic differences in birthweight and childhood asthma, conditions which may be linked causally or via a third variable. Cultural resources are often credited with diminished health disparities in infancy and childhood among subsets of poor and minority populations; yet direct empirical tests of this hypothesis are needed. In this study, ethnicity, lifespan family socioeconomic position (FSEP), and the cultural resource of familism were compared as predictors of birthweight and expression of asthma symptoms (AE) by age three. Familism and lifespan FSEP were assessed in 4633 socioeconomically disadvantaged African Americans, White Americans, and Latinas upon giving birth, as was offspring birthweight. AE was assessed in offspring through age three. Asthma diagnosis by age three was likelier in very low (≤1500 g) and low (≤2500 g) birthweight infants compared to infants born at average (2501–3999 g) or larger (≥4000 g) birthweights. Asthma risk associated with lower birthweight was higher for Latinos (17–35%) and African Americans (19–23%) than for White Americans (13–14%). As predicted, maternal familism was higher among White Americans than among African Americans and Latinas, an effect that was largely driven by ethnic disparities in lifespan FSEP. Familism predicted continuous birthweight (p = .003) and AE (p = .001) by age three independently of ethnicity and lifespan FSEP accounting for appropriate control variables, including maternal biomedical risk, maternal acculturation, parental marital status, and infant sex. There was a 71-g gain in birthweight for every one-unit increase in familism. The protective effect of familism on AE by age three was strongest for participants of lower lifespan FSEP. Maternal familism is one cultural resource that may reduce reproductive and intergenerational health disparities in both U.S.- and foreign-born Americans. Consistent with our previous work, familism and other nonmaterial resources covary with material resources. Nevertheless, culture is distinguishable from lifespan FSEP and ethnicity, and has health implications beyond associations to ethnicity, lifespan FSEP, and related biomedical and sociodemographic factors.

AB  - Background: Within the UK, during September, there is a pronounced increase in the number of unscheduled medical contacts by school-aged children (4-16 years) with asthma. It is thought that that this might be caused by the return back to school after the summer holidays, suddenly mixing with other children again and picking up viruses which could affect their asthma. There is also a drop in the number of prescriptions administered in August. It is possible therefore that children might not be taking their medication as they should during the summer contributing to them becoming ill when they return to school.It is hoped that a simple intervention from the GP to parents of children with asthma at the start of the summer holiday period, highlighting the importance of maintaining asthma medication can help prevent increased asthma exacerbation, and unscheduled NHS appointments, following return to school in September. Methods/design: PLEASANT is a cluster randomised trial. A total of 140 General Practices (GPs) will be recruited into the trial; 70 GPs randomised to the intervention and 70 control practices of "usual care". An average practice is expected to have approximately 100 children (aged 4-16 with a diagnosis of asthma) hence observational data will be collected on around 14000 children over a 24-month period. The Clinical Practice Research Datalink will collect all data required for the study which includes diagnostic, prescription and referral data. Discussion: The trial will assess whether the intervention can reduce exacerbation of asthma and unscheduled medical contacts in school-aged children associated with the return to school after the summer holidays. It has the potential to benefit the health and quality of life of children with asthma while also improving the effectiveness of NHS services by reducing NHS use in one of the busiest months of the year.An exploratory health economic analysis will gauge any cost saving associated with the intervention and subsequent impacts on quality of life. If results for the intervention are positive it is hoped that this could be adopted as part of routine care management of childhood asthma in general practice.

AB  - When I first began creating worksheets to organize my mother's chemotherapy treatment, people would ask me how I found time to focus on all the details of her care. The question surprised me because the answer was simple-how could I not? I am my mother's daughter. An RN for about four decades, my mom set an example of what it meant to put others first. Whether she was treating patients in a hospital or teaching them about chronic conditions in a classroom, she didn't give up. I watched firsthand as a child how she transformed from mom to an RN at a moment's notice. She took classes with me for childhood asthma, gave cardiopulmonary resuscitation to my little sister, Carmelle, after a seizure, and she would stop by the side of the road if there had been an accident. Still, I was too young to develop a true appreciation for what she did day in and day out. To me, she was simply "mom." She knew what to do and when to do it. Whether I needed a bandage or a hand to squeeze before a flu shot, she's the one I trusted. My mom had an exceptional ability to make things better, and that is exactly what she did. When she became a caregiver to my grandparents and several beloved family members later in life, I finally began to see how much she gave of herself to others. So, in 2006, when she told my sister and I that she had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, we instinctively followed in her footsteps. My sister and I became caregivers for the most important person in our lives, our mom. She would come first, and all the lessons she'd taught us about integrity, dedication, and unconditional love would come to fruition.

AB  - The causes of adult-onset asthma are poorly established, and the asthmogenic role of air pollution has been investigated primarily in children. This review assesses the current evidence of the association between air pollution and asthma incidence among subjects free of asthma at least until late childhood. Seven publications from five study populations fulfilled the inclusion criteria (one case-control and six cohort studies). All but one used markers of local traffic-related air pollution to characterize long-term exposure. Those studies reported similar associations with traffic-related air pollution. However, protocols, definitions of asthma, and exposure assignment were rather heterogeneous, and three publications relied on the same study; thus we abstain from meta-analytic summaries. Reported patterns of effect modification (e.g., by sex, atopy, or smoking) were inconsistent. Overall, the role of traffic-related air pollution in adult-onset asthma is less conclusive than in childhood asthma. Larger studies with more consistent definitions of phenotypes and exposure assessment for local traffic-related pollutants (e.g., ultrafine particles) are needed. Pooling existing cohorts such as in the ongoing European ESCAPE and TRANSPHORM consortia are promising steps. There is, however, a need for large-scale megacohorts to investigate these effects in standardized ways and to identify the most susceptible populations.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The prevalence of allergic diseases has reached a high prevalence in affluent countries. Yet, there are areas and living conditions associated with very low rates which are attributable to environmental exposures. One example is the low prevalence of childhood asthma and allergies amongst children raised on farms, particularly those exposed to farm animals and unprocessed cow's milk very early in life which are being reviewed in this article. RECENT FINDINGS: Several studies have shown that maternal exposure to various farm animals in pregnancy is related to a reduced risk of atopic dermatitis in the child and immune responses which have generally been regarded as protecting from the development of asthma and allergies. In addition, maternal and infant consumption of unprocessed cow's milk has repeatedly been associated with protection from childhood asthma and allergies. The precise nature of the protective factors remains to be elucidated. Maternal exposures to farm animals result in increased microbial exposures, the diversity of which has been associated with protection from childhood asthma. The beneficial milk constituents may, however, not be contained in the microbial contamination of milk samples but rather in the whey fraction of unprocessed cow's milk. SUMMARY: Better understanding of these protective exposures might in the future enable the development of new prevention strategies.

AB  - Background: In the city of New Orleans, Louisiana, and surrounding parishes (NOLA), children with asthma were perilously impacted by Hurricane Katrina as a result of disrupted health care, high home mold and allergen levels, and high stress. Objectives: The Head-off Environmental Asthma in Louisiana (HEAL) study was conducted to examine relationships between the post-Katrina environment and childhood asthma in NOLA and assess a novel asthma counselor intervention that provided case management and guidance for reducing home mold and allergen levels. Methods: Children (4-12 years old) with moderate-to-severe asthma were recruited from NOLA schools. Over 1 year, they received two clinical evaluations, three home environmental evaluations, and the asthma intervention. Quarterly end points included symptom days, medication use, and unscheduled emergency department or clinic visits. A community advisory group was assembled and informed HEAL at all phases. Results: Of the children (n = 182) enrolled in HEAL, 67% were African American, and 25% came from households with annual incomes < $15,000. HEAL children were symptomatic, averaging 6.6 symptom days in the 2 weeks before baseline, and had frequent unscheduled visits to clinics or emergency departments (76% had at least one unscheduled visit in the preceding 3 months). In this report, we describe study design and baseline characteristics of HEAL children. Conclusions: Despite numerous challenges faced by investigators, study staff, and participants, including destroyed infrastructure, disrupted lives, and lost jobs, HEAL was successful in terms of recruitment and retention, the high quality of data collected that will provide insight into asthma-allergen relationships, and the asthma intervention. This success was attributable to using an adaptive approach and refining processes as needed.

AB  - Background: Childhood asthma morbidity and mortality in New Orleans, Louisiana, is among the highest in the nation. In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina created an environmental disaster that led to high levels of mold and other allergens and disrupted health care for children with asthma. Objectives: We implemented a unique hybrid asthma counselor and environmental intervention based on successful National Institutes of Health asthma interventions from the National Cooperative Inner City Asthma (NCICAS) and Inner-City Asthma (ICAS) Studies with the goal of reducing asthma symptoms in New Orleans children after Hurricane Katrina. Methods: Children (4-12 years old) with moderate-to-severe asthma (n = 182) received asthma counseling and environmental intervention for approximately 1 year. HEAL was evaluated employing several analytical approaches including a pre-post evaluation of symptom changes over the entire year, an analysis of symptoms according to the timing of asthma counselor contact, and a comparison to previous evidence-based interventions. Results: Asthma symptoms during the previous 2 weeks decreased from 6.5 days at enrollment to 3.6 days at the 12-month symptom assessment (a 45% reduction, p < 0.001), consistent with changes observed after NCICAS and ICAS interventions (35% and 62% reductions in symptom days, respectively). Children whose families had contact with a HEAL asthma counselor by 6 months showed a 4.09-day decrease [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.25 to 4.94-day decrease] in symptom days, compared with a 1.79-day decrease (95% CI: 0.90, 2.67) among those who had not yet seen an asthma counselor (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The novel combination of evidence-based asthma interventions was associated with improved asthma symptoms among children in post-Katrina New Orleans. Post-intervention changes in symptoms were consistent with previous randomized trials of NCICAS and ICAS interventions.

AB  - Background: The emerging consensus that exposure to near-roadway traffic-related pollution causes asthma has implications for compact urban development policies designed to reduce driving and greenhouse gases. Objectives: We estimated the current burden of childhood asthma-related disease attributable to near-roadway and regional air pollution in Los Angeles County (LAC) and the potential health impact of regional pollution reduction associated with changes in population along major traffic corridors. Methods: The burden of asthma attributable to the dual effects of near-roadway and regional air pollution was estimated, using nitrogen dioxide and ozone as markers of urban combustion-related and secondary oxidant pollution, respectively. We also estimated the impact of alternative scenarios that assumed a 20% reduction in regional pollution in combination with a 3.6% reduction or 3.6% increase in the proportion of the total population living near major roads, a proxy for near-roadway exposure. Results: We estimated that 27,100 cases of childhood asthma (8% of total) in LAC were at least partly attributable to pollution associated with residential location within 75 m of a major road. As a result, a substantial proportion of asthma-related morbidity is a consequence of near-roadway pollution, even if symptoms are triggered by other factors. Benefits resulting from a 20% regional pollution reduction varied markedly depending on the associated change in near-roadway proximity. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that there are large and previously unappreciated public health consequences of air pollution in LAC and probably in other metropolitan areas with dense traffic corridors. To maximize health benefits, compact urban development strategies should be coupled with policies to reduce near-roadway pollution exposure.

AB  - Background: The authors assessed whether socioeconomic inequalities in asthma symptoms were already present in preschool children and to what extent prenatal, perinatal and postnatal risk factors for asthma symptoms mediate the effect of socioeconomic status (SES). Methods: The study included 3136 Dutch children participating in the Generation R Study, a prospective cohort study. Adjusted ORs of asthma symptoms for low and middle SES (household income and maternal education) compared to high SES were calculated after adjustment for potential confounders and also adjusted for prenatal, perinatal and postnatal mediators at preschool age. Results: At age 1 year, low-SES children had a 40% lower risk of asthma symptoms compared to high-SES children (p<0.01). However, the risk of asthma symptoms in 3- and 4-year-old low-SES children was 1.5 times higher compared to their high-SES age mates (p<0.05). The positive associations at age 1 year were particularly modified by postnatal factors (up to 38%). In toddlers, prenatal factors explained up to 58% of the negative associations between SES and asthma symptoms. Conclusions: SES indirectly affects asthma symptoms at preschool age. The inverse association between SES and asthma symptoms emerges at age 3 years. This is particularly due to a high level of adverse prenatal circumstances in low-SES toddlers. Future research should evaluate public health programs (during pregnancy) to reduce socioeconomic inequalities in childhood asthma.

AB  - Background: The risk of developing childhood asthma has been linked to the severity and etiology of viral respiratory illnesses in early childhood. Since inner-city infants have unique environmental exposures, we hypothesized that patterns of respiratory viral infections would also be distinct.Methods: We compared the viral etiology of respiratory illnesses in 2 groups: a cohort of 515 infants from 4 inner-city areas and a cohort of 285 infants from mainly suburban Madison, Wisconsin. Nasal secretions were sampled during periods of respiratory illness and at 1 year of age and were analyzed for viral pathogens by multiplex polymerase chain reaction.Results: Overall, inner-city infants had lower rates of viral detection. Considering specific viruses, sick urban infants had lower rates of detectable rhinovirus or respiratory syncytial virus infection and higher rates of adenovirus infection. Every urban site had a higher proportion of adenovirus-positive samples associated with illnesses (10%-21%), compared with Madison (6%).Conclusions: These findings provide evidence that inner-city babies have different patterns of viral respiratory illnesses than babies who grow up in a more suburban location. These findings raise important questions about the etiology of virus-negative illnesses in urban infants and the possibility of long-term consequences of early life infections with adenovirus in this population.

AB  - Background: Studies exploring the relationship between prenatal vitamin D exposure and childhood asthma have yielded conflicting results. Higher vitamin D intake during pregnancy has been shown to lower the risk of childhood wheeze, yet a study of maternal late-pregnancy serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D suggested higher serum concentrations may be associated with increased childhood asthma.Objective: To assess the relationship between mothers' serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D status and asthma and wheeze phenotypes in their children at age 6 years. Also to explore the relationship between maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D status and objective measures of childhood atopy and lung function.Methods: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was measured at 34 weeks' gestation in the mothers of 860 children born at term. Wheeze was classified as either transient or persistent/late using questionnaire data collated from 6, 12, 24 and 36 months and 6 years. At 6 years spirometry was performed and atopic status was determined by skin prick testing, exhaled nitric oxide was measured in 451 children and bronchial hyperresponsiveness in 216 children.Results: There were no significant associations between maternal late-pregnancy 25-hydroxyvitamin D status and either asthma or wheeze at age 6 years. Maternal vitamin D status was not associated with transient or persistent/late wheeze; no significant association was found between persistent/late wheeze when subdivided according to atopic status. No associations were found with skin sensitisation or lung function.Conclusions: This study provides no evidence that exposure to higher concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in maternal serum during late pregnancy increases the risk of childhood asthma, wheeze or atopy.

AB  - Studies of asthma admissions in the St. Louis metropolitan area have disclosed substantial numbers of children with readmissions. To determine the magnitude of readmissions and attributes of children with readmissions, a retrospective analysis of 8,761 children with 14,905 asthma hospitalizations for January 1, 1990 through December 31, 1999 at the two university affiliated children's hospitals in St. Louis was undertaken. Patient attributes of age, sex, race/ethnicity, residence, payor status, length of stay, and month of admission were compared between patients admitted once during that period and patients admitted multiple times. Main outcome measures were the total number of admissions and time to readmission during the study interval. A Lin, Wei, Yang, and Ying model of time to readmission showed that African-American children with Medicaid or no insurance are at higher risk of readmission (risk ratio 1.28) than are African-American patients with commercial insurance or white/other race/ethnicity patients regardless of insurance. Probability of readmission increased from 30% after a first admission, 46% after a second, and 59% after a third. Prior admission was a more specific indicator of readmission with greater positive predictive value than ethnicity or insurance status or their combination.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The recommended duration of specific immunotherapy (SIT) treatment relies on empiric data and is not well documented. OBJECTIVE: To detect possible differences in the long-term effectiveness between 3 and 5 years of house dust mite (HDM) SIT in asthmatic children. METHODS: We performed a 3-year natural history study of 90 asthmatic children who were sensitive only to HDM. Three groups were recruited: 30 who had completed 3 years of HDM SIT (SIT3), 30 who had completed 5 years of HDM SIT (SIT5), and 30 who had an indication for HDM SIT but whose parents refused HDM SIT. Patients attended an enrollment visit in 2007, after SIT discontinuation, and 3 annual follow-up visits at the clinic. The long-term effectiveness of HDM SIT was primarily assessed via analysis of the reduction in required inhaled corticosteroid dose, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and asthma remission. RESULTS: A total of 84 children completed the study. Both SIT durations produced excellent results; asthma remission in both SIT3 (50%) and SIT5 (54%) groups was significantly higher when compared with control (3.3%). The minimal controlling inhaled corticosteroid dose reduction in SIT5 group (median, 75%) was significantly higher compared with the SIT3 group (median, 50%) after immunotherapy discontinuation; after 3 years without SIT, no differences were found between the SIT5 and SIT3 groups (median, 100% and 94%, respectively). We observed a slightly higher increase in forced expiratory volume in 1 second in the SIT5 group compared with the SIT3 group. CONCLUSION: Three years of SIT is an adequate duration for the treatment of childhood asthma associated with HDM allergy because 2 further years of SIT added no clinical benefit.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the proportion of anti- Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cp) IgM positivity in patients with uncontrolled asthma and partly controlled childhood asthma and their clinical correlates.Methods: This was a hospital based cross sectional study. Children aged 1 to 12 y suffering from asthma were included after written informed parental consent. For diagnosis and classification of uncontrolled and partly controlled asthma, GINA guidelines 2009 were used. Anti-Cp IgM was tested by using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and value of antibody index ≥ 0.90 was considered positive. Data was collected on demographic, clinical and investigative variables including chest radiograph posterior-anterior view.Results: From August 2010 through August 2011 44 patients hospitalized with uncontrolled asthma in exacerbation and 45 patients with partly controlled asthma from ambulatory care settings were included. Anti-Cp IgM was positive in 25 % (n = 11/44) and 6.7 % (n = 3/45) patients with uncontrolled and partly controlled asthma, respectively (Odds ratio = 4.67, χ (2) = 5.64, 95 % CI 1.20-18.10, p 0.0 17). Among the patients of uncontrolled asthma, duration of hospital stay was longer in anti-Cp IgM positive patients (9 ± 2.19 vs. 7.19 ± 2.10 d, p 0.02).Conclusions: Since anti-Cp IgM positivity was associated with age >5 y and radiological consolidation in uncontrolled asthma in exacerbation, specific treatment of Chlamydia pneumoniae must be actively considered.

AB  - For each issue of Journal of Consumer Health on the Internet, the editor selects three to five health care sites containing high quality health care information on a given subject. The topic for each issue is very much dependent on the whim of the editor and the consumer questions that have crossed her desk. Sites used within the column are chosen based on the editor's personal experience and usage of the Internet. Each select site has been subjected to rigorous evaluation criteria. Evaluation criteria include: reputation of the producer/publisher of the site; bias; content and scope of information provided (including types of information provided—general overviews or specific conditions, treatments, etc.); intended audience (professionals, adults, teens, or children); currency of site updates; and viability of links. Dead links and changing URLs are a problematic reality of Internet usage. The selected sites have exhibited stability in providing long-term access to quality information. Columns begin with a brief discussion of the topic. In addition to the selected sites, other resource sites and URLs may be included in the discussion. Following the discussion, the main page of each select site will be reproduced, including site title and URL for bookmark purposes. The second page will summarize producer information, content, search options, audience, and noteworthy items. JCHI Editor's Select Sites are printed on two facing pages so they can be used as guides beside computer terminals. Web site and topic suggestions for the JCHI Editor's Select Sites column are welcome. Send suggestions to: Nancy R. Glassman, D.

Treatment with inhaled corticosteroids improves airway responsiveness and asthma control.Objectives: To assess the effect of vitamin D levels on prebronchodilator FEV(1), bronchodilator response, and responsiveness to methacholine (PC(20), provocative concentration of methacholine producing a 20% decline in FEV(1)) in patients with asthma treated with inhaled corticosteroids.Methods: We measured 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in the serum of children with persistent asthma at the time of enrollment in the Childhood Asthma Management Program. We divided subjects into the vitamin D sufficiency (>30 ng/ml), insufficiency (20-30 ng/ml), and deficiency (<20 ng/ml) groups. Covariates included age, treatment, sex, body mass index, race, history of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and season that vitamin D specimen was drawn. Our main outcome measures were change in prebronchodilator FEV(1), bronchodilator response, and PC(20) from enrollment to 8-12 months.Measurements and Main Results: Of the 1,024 subjects, 663 (65%) were vitamin D sufficient, 260 (25%) were insufficient, and 101 (10%) were deficient. Vitamin D-deficient subjects were more likely to be older, African American, and have a higher body mass index compared with the vitamin D-sufficient and insufficient subjects. In the inhaled corticosteroid treatment group, prebronchodilator FEV(1) increased from randomization to 12 months by 140 ml in the vitamin D-deficient group and prebronchodilator FEV(1) increased by 330 ml in the vitamin D insufficiency group and by 290 ml in the vitamin D sufficiency group (P = 0.0072), in adjusted models.Conclusions: In children with asthma treated with inhaled corticosteroids, vitamin D deficiency is associated with poorer lung function than in children with vitamin D insufficiency or sufficiency.

AB  - Background: The use of inhaled glucocorticoids for persistent asthma causes a temporary reduction in growth velocity in prepubertal children. The resulting decrease in attained height 1 to 4 years after the initiation of inhaled glucocorticoids is thought not to decrease attained adult height.Methods: We measured adult height in 943 of 1041 participants (90.6%) in the Childhood Asthma Management Program; adult height was determined at a mean (±SD) age of 24.9±2.7 years. Starting at the age of 5 to 13 years, the participants had been randomly assigned to receive 400 μg of budesonide, 16 mg of nedocromil, or placebo daily for 4 to 6 years. We calculated differences in adult height for each active treatment group, as compared with placebo, using multiple linear regression with adjustment for demographic characteristics, asthma features, and height at trial entry.Results: Mean adult height was 1.2 cm lower (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.9 to -0.5) in the budesonide group than in the placebo group (P=0.001) and was 0.2 cm lower (95% CI, -0.9 to 0.5) in the nedocromil group than in the placebo group (P=0.61). A larger daily dose of inhaled glucocorticoid in the first 2 years was associated with a lower adult height (-0.1 cm for each microgram per kilogram of body weight) (P=0.007). The reduction in adult height in the budesonide group as compared with the placebo group was similar to that seen after 2 years of treatment (-1.3 cm; 95% CI, -1.7 to -0.9). During the first 2 years, decreased growth velocity in the budesonide group occurred primarily in prepubertal participants.Conclusions: The initial decrease in attained height associated with the use of inhaled glucocorticoids in prepubertal children persisted as a reduction in adult height, although the decrease was not progressive or cumulative.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthma is the most common chronic respiratory disease seriously endangering the health of children. But disease awareness and self-management skills are relatively poor in children; parents play an important role in the control of childhood asthma. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the status of asthma control and severity of asthma in children and to identify impact factors. METHODS: We studied 1 tertiary hospital in each of the 29 provinces. A total of 2,960 parents with children with asthma who visited those hospitals were selected for the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) questionnaire survey, and separated into the controlled asthma group and uncontrolled asthma group according to children's asthma conditions in the past 12 months. Multivariate analysis was carried out based on the answers to 28 tested factors. RESULTS: In the past 12 months, 66.0% of children with asthma had asthma attacks, 26.8% visited an emergency room, and 16.2% were hospitalized. The total cost for asthma was significantly higher in the uncontrolled group than controlled group ([chi](2) = 23.14, P < .01). Twelve protective factors of asthma control were founded, such as older age of children, long disease course, high KAP scores of parents, compliance with using nasal steroids, and knowledge of '3 or more times recurrent wheezing suggesting asthma.' The risk factors were eczema and family history of asthma. CONCLUSION: Children's asthma is poorly controlled. The cost of asthma is significantly higher in uncontrolled asthma than in controlled. The age of children, course of asthma, personal history of allergy, family history of asthma, parents' education level, and parents' KAP are factors that affect asthma control.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Genetic association studies have demonstrated that over 100 variants in target genes (including ADAM33) are associated with airway remodeling and hyper-responsiveness in different ethnic groups; however, this has never been evaluated in Arabic populations. The objective of this study was to determine whether ADAM33 polymorphisms that are associated with asthma in a population of asthmatic children from Saudi Arabia.Design and Setting: A cross-sectional pilot study comparing the polymorphisms of normal subjects and asthmatic patients from Saudi Arabia over a period of 1 year.Patients and Methods: One hundred and seven Saudi asthmatic children and 87 healthy Saudi children of 3-12 years old were assessed for allelic association of ADAM33 T1 (rs2280091), T2 (rs2280090), ST+4 (rs44707) and S1 (rs3918396) SNPs to asthma. Genotyping was done by real-time PCR, multiplex ARMS and PCR-RFLP.Results: T1 and T2 SNP genotype frequencies in asthmatic children were significantly different compared to controls (P < .05), indicating allelic association with asthma. The T1 A/G and G/G and the T2 A/G and A/A genotypes (P=.0013 and P=.008, respectively) but not S1 and ST+4, increased the risk of asthma when using the best fit dominant model. Strong linkage disequilibrium between T1 (rs2280091) and T2 (rs2280090) was observed (r2=0.83; D'=0.95; P < .001). The haplotype G-A-A-C was significantly more frequent in asthmatics, thus supporting the association of T1 G-allele and T2 A-allele with increased predisposition to asthma (P=.007).Conclusions: T1 A/G and T2 G/A ADAM33 polymorphisms, but not S1 or ST+4, were significantly associated with asthma development in Saudi children, like those reported for white and Hispanic populations in the United States.

AB  - Objective: RANTES is considered to play an important role in various allergic disorders since it is a potent chemoattractant for inflammatory cells such as eosinophils, memory T cells and monocytes. The aim of this study is to determine serum RANTES levels and to assess whether or not it varies in acute attack in the children with asthma. Materials and Methods: Serum RANTES levels were measured in 16 asthmatic children (2 to 14 years of age, median 4.5 years) longitudinally during asthma attacks and two weeks later by ELISA technique. Ten healthy age-matched children without any atopic and infectious disease served as controls. Results: There was no significant difference in serum levels of RANTES between asthmatic patients with acute attacks and controls. Two weeks following the acute attack, the serum RANTES levels were higher than the controls, however the difference was insignificant. When we compared the serum RANTES levels of asthmatic patients during acute attack and two weeks following the acute attack, the serum RANTES levels were elevated in 11 asthmatic patients, decreased in four, and remained unchanged in one. This variation occurring among asthmatic acute attack versus stable asthmatic children was statistically significant (p< 0.05). Conclusion: The up-regulation in the production of RANTES detected in stable asthmatic children two weeks after the acute attack suggests that RANTES is a mediator in the pathogenesis of childhood asthma.

AB  - Diagnosis and management of severe asthma implies the definition of different entities, that is, difficult asthma and refractory severe asthma, but also the different phenotypes included in the term refractory severe asthma. A complete evaluation by a physician expert in asthma is necessary, adapted for each child. Identification of mechanisms involved in different phenotypes in refractory severe asthma may improve the therapeutic approach. The quality of care and monitoring of children with severe asthma is as important as the prescription drug, and is also crucial for differentiating between severe asthma and difficult asthma, whereby expertise is required.

AB  - Background: The effect of ambient air pollution on global variations and trends in asthma prevalence is unclear. Objectives: Our goal was to investigate community-level associations between asthma prevalence data from the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) and satellite-based estimates of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 μm (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and modelled estimates of ozone. Methods: We assigned satellite-based estimates of PM2.5 and NO2 at a spatial resolution of 0.1Â° x 0.1Â° and modeled estimates of ozone at a resolution of 1Â° x 1Â° to 183 ISAAC centers. We used center-level prevalence of severe asthma as the outcome and multilevel models to adjust for gross national income (GNI) and center- and country-level sex, climate, and population density. We examined associations (adjusting for GNI) between air pollution and asthma prevalence over time in centers with data from ISAAC Phase One (mid-1900s) and Phase Three (2001-2003). Results: For the 13- to 14-year age group (128 centers in 28 countries), the estimated average within-country change in center-level asthma prevalence per 100 children per 10% increase in center-level PM2.5 and NO2 was -0.043 [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.139, 0.053] and 0.017 (95% CI: -0.030, 0.064) respectively. For ozone the estimated change in prevalence per parts per billion by volume was -0.116 (95% CI: -0.234, 0.001). Equivalent results for the 6- to 7-year age group (83 centers in 20 countries), though slightly different, were not significantly positive. For the 13- to 14-year age group, change in center-level asthma prevalence over time per 100 children per 10% increase in PM2.5 from Phase One to Phase Three was -0.139 (95% CI: -0.347, 0.068). The corresponding association with ozone (per ppbV) was -0.171 (95% CI: -0.275, -0.067). Conclusion: In contrast to reports from within-community studies of individuals exposed to traffic pollution, we did not find evidence of a positive association between ambient air pollution and asthma prevalence as measured at the community level.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the impact of environmental interventions and lifestyle management on respiratory symptoms, concurrent changes in asthma management and whether any observed health benefit could be attributed to these interventions.Methods: A longitudinal single cohort pre-post study was conducted on children between 5–14 y with moderate to severe asthma in an outpatient clinic at Jamshedpur over 2 y. History was noted using the pre-intervention questionnaire covering a period of 3 mo prior to enrolment. Participants were followed for 6 mo post- intervention. A childhood asthma severity (CHAS) scale was made and statistical analysis such as Wilcoxon rank sum tests and Mcnemar’s test performed to validate the outcomes. Principal component analysis was performed to classify the participants having no, mild and severe symptoms.Results: There was significant reduction in symptoms and need for medical care post-intervention. Mean of the respiratory symptom score decreased from 7.4 to 2.4 (p < 0.0001) and mean of the health care utilization score decreased from 4.1 to 1.7 (p < 0.0004) in the wilcoxon rank sum tests. Mcnemar’s test was used for the analysis of individual item of the asthma symptoms. A significant reduction in wheeze and cough (p < 0.001), slowing down physical activity (p < 0.001), diurnal symptoms (p < 0.000), school absence (p < 0.000), rescue therapy requirement (p < 0.1) and hospitalization (p < 0.000) was seen. PCA was used successfully to classify the participants on the basis of their severity of asthma.Conclusions: Respiratory symptoms decreased significantly among asthmatic children following environmental interventions.

AB  - Background: The Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT) and the Asthma Control Test (ACT) are validated measures of asthma control in which a score of 19 is defined as uncontrolled according to published reports. However, different cut points may exist in different ethnic populations.Objective: To determine the cut point for uncontrolled asthma in a Mexican descent population from Orange Country, California, compared with an age- and asthma severity-matched non-Hispanic cohort.Methods: The C-ACT (in children 6-11 years old) and ACT (in children 12-17 years old) scores were collected from 151 children of Mexican descent and 48 non-Hispanic controls with mild-to-moderate asthma who lived in Orange County. Physicians were masked to C-ACT and ACT scores while assessing control based on National Asthma Education and Prevention program guidelines. The receiver operating characteristic method was used to examine the screening accuracy of the tests to detect uncontrolled asthma. The optimal cut points were selected by maximizing the total sensitivity and specificity.Results: Cronbach α values for the C-ACT (0.76) and the ACT (0.80) confirmed that both tests were reliable in our study population. The C-ACT and ACT scores were statistically higher in children of Mexican descent than non-Hispanic children (P = .008). A cut point of 22 was optimal to detect uncontrolled asthma in children of Mexican descent 6 to 11 years old (group 1: sensitivity, 0.74; specificity, 0.86; area under the curve [AUC], 0.83) and children 12 to 17 years old (group 3: sensitivity, 0.78; specificity, 0.68; AUC, 0.79). For non-Hispanic controls, a cut point of 20 were optimal to detect uncontrolled asthma in children 6 to 11 years old (group 2: sensitivity, 0.70; specificity, 0.91; AUC, 0.86) and children 12 to 17 years old (group 4: sensitivity, 0.83; specificity, 0.87; AUC, 0.91).Conclusion: In this cross-ethnic validation study, children of Mexican descent in Orange County seem to underreport asthma symptoms compared with a non-Hispanic population and may require higher C-ACT and ACT cut points to detect uncontrolled asthma.

AB  - Background: There are limited data assessing relationships between biomarkers of inflammation and lung function after hospitalization for asthma exacerbations in children.Objective: To assess the associations in asthmatic children among changes in lung function, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), and cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) after hospitalization for acute asthma.Methods: Spirometry and FENO were measured and EBC collected for CysLT measurement from 40 children during and 1, 2, and 4 weeks after hospitalization for an asthma exacerbation and during a single-study visit for 40 healthy children.Results: Enrollment FENO and EBC CysLT concentrations were higher in the children with asthma than in healthy individuals (mean FENO, 31.6 vs 7 ppb; P < .0001; mean EBC CysLT, 7.9 vs 4.9 ppb; P = .03). Among children with asthma, improvement in lung function reached a plateau within 2 weeks after hospital discharge. The EBC CysLT concentrations were not associated with changes in lung function, use of albuterol, or use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs). Among asthmatic children enrollment FENO was not associated with changes in lung function during follow-up. However, among children who had an elevated enrollment FENO (≥25 ppb), patients who did not use ICSs after hospital discharge had lower end-of-study lung function than those who used ICSs. At 2 and 4 weeks after hospital discharge, FENO was higher among patients who reported albuterol use more than twice weekly and among patients who reported no ICS use.Conclusion: FENO measured at hospital discharge among children hospitalized with acute asthma may be useful in identifying patients who will respond to ICS therapy.

AB  - Background: Maternal factors are implicated in the onset of childhood asthma. Differentiation of naÃ¯ve CD4+ T lymphocytes into pro-allergic T-helper 2 cells induces interleukin (IL)4 expression and inhibits interferon (IFN)γ expression accompanied by concordant methylation changes in the promoters of these genes. However, it has yet to be established whether maternal exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can alter these gene promoters epigenetically during fetal development. Objectives: In this study we sought to elucidate the relationship between maternal PAH exposure and promoter methylation status of IFNγ and IL4. Methods: We assessed the effects of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), a representative airborne PAH, on the methylation status of the IFNγ and IL4 promoters in Jurkat cells and two lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, and on gene expression. In addition, we evaluated methylation status of the IFNγ promoter in cord white blood cells from 53 participants in the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health cohort. Maternal PAH exposure was estimated by personal air monitoring during pregnancy. Results: In vitro exposure of the cell models to low, noncytotoxic doses (0.1 and 1 nM) of BaP elicited increased promoter hypermethylation and reduced expression of IFNγ, but not IL4. IFNγ promoter methylation in cord white blood cells was associated with maternal PAH exposure in the cohort study subsample. Conclusion: Consistent with the results for the cell lines, maternal exposure to PAHs was associated with hypermethylation of IFNγ in cord blood DNA from cohort children. These findings support a potential role of epigenetics in fetal reprogramming by PAH-induced environmental diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: International guidelines highlight the importance of assessing asthma control status in children with asthma, and research on practical and objective instruments for assessing asthma control is ongoing. OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of the Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT) and fractional concentration of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) in identifying children with not well-controlled asthma. METHODS: Children 6 to 11 years of age with asthma were enrolled in the study. They completed C-ACT and underwent FeNO and spirometric measurements during the monthly clinic visits. An asthma specialist assessed asthma control according to the gold standard Global Initiative for Asthma guideline and decided the treatment of the patients. RESULTS: Seventy-six children with a mean (SD) age of 8.7 (1.4) years were evaluated in the first visit, whereas 64 and 51 children were admitted for second and third visits, respectively. A C-ACT score of 22 or less had 69% sensitivity and 77% specificity in determining not well-controlled asthma, whereas an FeNO value of 19 ppb or higher had 61% sensitivity and 59% specificity in patients who completed 3 visits. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that the C-ACT was better than FeNO for identifying patients with not well-controlled asthma (area under the curve, 0.79; P < .001 [C-ACT] vs .58, P = .10 [FeNO]) Results of multivariate generalized estimating equation analysis revealed that a C-ACT score of 22 or less (odds ratio, 8.75; 95% confidence interval, 4.35-17.59; P < .001) and an FeNO of 19 ppb or greater (odds ratio, 2.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-6.29; P = .03) were significant indicators for the presence of not well-controlled asthma. CONCLUSION: The C-ACT is superior to FeNO in determining the control status of children with asthma and may be used as a complementary tool in clinical practice to detect children with not well-controlled asthma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment guidelines recommend using an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) plus a long-acting [beta](2)-agonist (LABA) for childhood asthma when the symptoms are not controlled by ICS alone, but the appropriate use of LABAs in children continues to be debated. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of an inhaled salmeterol and fluticasone propionate combination, 50/100 [mu]g twice daily, with fluticasone propionate, 100 [mu]g twice daily, or salmeterol, 50 [mu]g twice daily, in children with multiple-trigger wheeze. METHODS: A total of 105 children 4 to 7 years of age with multiple-trigger wheezing based on respiratory symptoms and bronchodilator responsiveness and/or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction without a viral cold were randomized to salmeterol-fluticasone, fluticasone propionate alone, or salmeterol alone via a metered-dose inhaler and a spacer device for 8 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome was exhaled nitric oxide level. Secondary outcomes were lung function measurements via impulse oscillometry, respiratory symptoms, and rescue medication use. RESULTS: The exhaled nitric oxide levels decreased after all treatments, significantly more so after salmeterol-fluticasone and fluticasone than with salmeterol (adjusted geometric means at 8 weeks: salmeterol-fluticasone, 9.4 ppb; fluticasone, 9.3 ppb; salmeterol, 13.9 ppb; salmeterol-fluticasone vs salmeterol, P = .02; fluticasone vs salmeterol, P = .01). No treatment differences were found with respect to respiratory symptoms or median rescue use. Salmeterol-fluticasone resulted in a small but statistically significant improvement in baseline lung function compared with fluticasone. All treatments were equally well tolerated. CONCLUSION: The effects of salmeterol-fluticasone and fluticasone were comparable, although lung function improvement was better with salmeterol-fluticasone than with fluticasone alone. There is no obvious benefit in initiation therapy with salmeterol-fluticasone rather than fluticasone alone in the treatment of steroid-naive children with multiple-trigger wheeze.

AB  - Objective: To report the oral corticosteroid-sparing effect of omalizumab in children with severe asthma.Design: 16-week therapeutic trial.Setting: Tertiary paediatric asthma clinic.Patients: 34 children with severe asthma maintained on oral prednisolone (median age 12 years; 15 children <12 years and 19 children ≥12 years).Interventions: Fortnightly or monthly subcutaneous injections of omalizumab; the dose was calculated as per manufacturer's instructions based on body weight and serum immunoglobulin E concentration.Main Outcome Measures: Reduction in prednisolone dose; mini-Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ); Childhood Asthma Control Test (ACT); forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)).Results: Median daily prednisolone dose reduced from 20 mg to 5 mg (n=34, p<0.0001), including seven children who stopped prednisolone completely. Mini-AQLQ score increased from 3.5 to 5.9 (n=24, p<0.0001). Childhood ACT score increased from 12 to 20 (n=23, p=0.0001). FEV(1) increased from 2.10 to 2.25 litres (n=31, non-significant). The reduction in prednisolone dose and improvements in mini-AQLQ and childhood ACT were significant in children both under and over 12 years of age, with no differences in outcome detected between these two groups.Conclusions: A 16-week therapeutic trial of omalizumab allowed a significant reduction in daily prednisolone dose and was associated with improvements in asthma control and quality of life in 34 children with severe asthma. Similar benefits were seen in children both above and below 12 years of age. These uncontrolled data are very encouraging. There is an urgent requirement for a multicentre randomised placebo-controlled trial of omalizumab in children with severe asthma, with reduction in oral corticosteroid dose as the primary outcome measure.

AB  - Adherence of participants in a long-term clinical trial is necessary to assure validity of findings. This article examines adherence differences between single-parent and two-parent families in the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP). Adherence was defined as the percentage of completed daily diary cards and scheduled study visits during the course of the trial. Logistic regression and ordinal logistic regression analyses were used. Children from single-parent families had a lower percentage of completed diary cards (72% vs. 84%) than two-parent families. Single-parent families were also more likely to reschedule visits (62% vs. 45%) and miss more clinic visits (23% vs. 17%) than two-parent families. Suggestions are given for study coordinators to assist participants in completing a long-term clinical trial. Many suggestions may be adapted for nurses in inpatient or outpatient settings for assisting parents of patients with chronic diseases.

AB  - The medical records of 3922 school children residing in the Greater Haifa Metropolitan Area in Northern Israel were analyzed. Individual exposure to ambient air pollution (SO2 and PM10) for each child was estimated using Geographic Information Systems tools. Factors affecting childhood asthma risk were then investigated using logistic regression and the more recently developed Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) tools. The analysis reveals that childhood asthma in the study area appears to be significantly associated with particulate matter of less than 10 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.11; P < 0.001). However, no significant association with asthma prevalence was found for SO2 (P > 0.2), when PM10 and SO2 were introduced into the models simultaneously. When considering a change in PM10 between the least and the most polluted parts of the study area (9.4 μg/m3), the corresponding OR, calculated using the BMA analysis, is 2.58 (with 95% posterior probability limits of OR ranging from 1.52 to 4.41), controlled for gender, age, proximity to main roads, the town of a child's residence, and family's socio-economic status. Thus, it is concluded that exposure to airborne particular matter, even at relatively low concentrations (40–50 μg/m3), generally below international air pollution standards (55–70 μg/m3), appears to be a considerable risk factor for childhood asthma in urban areas. This should be a cause of concern for public health authorities and environmental decision-makers.

AB  - Introduction: The reliability and validity of Turkish version of Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT).Purpose: The management of asthma is an important as well as difficult issue of physician's daily practice particularly in busy clinical settings. C-ACT was created to identify asthma control levels in children aged 4-11 years. Our aim was to evaluate the reliability, validity and responsiveness of C-ACT in a Turkish sample of children with asthma.Method: In this multicenter study, 368 children were enrolled. C-ACT was completed every month by parents and patients who were evaluated in 3 visits within 2 month intervals. At each visit, physicians interpret the control level and decided for the treatment step as established in GINA guidelines.Results: The internal consistency reliability of the Turkish version of C-ACT (C-ACT1 to C-ACT5) was found to be 0.82, 0.83, 0.82, 0.82 and 0.80, respectively (reliability statistics, Cronbach's alpha). Test-retest reliability was 0.71. There was significant correlation between C-ACT and physician's assessment of asthma control at visit 1 (r = 0.65, P < 0.001).Conclusions: Turkish version of C-ACT is an accurate and reliable tool to evaluate asthma control in children aged 4-11 years. Its widespread use may facilitate appropriate assessment of asthma control and may lead to decrease the number of uncontrolled patients.

AB  - The prevalence and burden of childhood asthma remain high and are increasing. Asthma hot spot neighborhoods around the country face particular challenges in controlling the effects of the condition. Increasing attention is being paid to developing interventions that recognize the child and family as the primary managers of disease and to introducing assistance that reaches beyond the clinical care setting into the places where families live and work. A range of types of community-focused interventions has been assessed in the past decade in schools, homes, and community health clinics, and programs using electronic media and phone links have been evaluated. Stronger evidence for all these approaches is needed. However, school-based programs and community coalitions designed to bring about policy and systems changes show particular promise for achieving sustainable improvements in asthma control. Research is needed that emphasizes comparisons among proven asthma control interventions, translation of effective approaches to new settings and communities, and institutionalization of effective strategies.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the role of gene-environment interaction between interleukin (IL)-4 promoter and mold exposure on the development of asthma. METHODS: We conducted a cohort-based, incident, case-control study. The case group consisted of 188 children with new asthma and the control group (n = 376) was matched for age and gender. The outcome of interest was the development of asthma over the 6-year study period. The studied determinants were three polymorphisms of IL-4 promoter (TT, CT, and CC) and three indicators of exposure including histories of water damage, presence of visible molds, and perceived mold odor in the home. RESULTS: Apparent joint effects between IL-4 promoter and mold exposure were observed on both additive and multiplicative scales. Specially, the risk of asthma was significantly associated with children carrying the CT genotype and visible mold exposure comparing with those carrying the TT genotype without any exposure indicator (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-4.34; modified Rothman synergy index for directly use of odds and OR [s] = 1.41; P for interaction = .03). A similar tendency was found (s = 1.30; P for interaction = .04) for children who were exposed to mold odor and carried CT genotype (adjusted OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.03-4.41). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that gene-environment interactions between the IL-4 promoter and an indoor mold problem may play an important role in childhood asthma.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: Asthma in Latin America is a growing public health problem and seems to be most prevalent and cause most morbidity among poor urban populations. This article will review the findings of recent human studies of the associations of asthma prevalence in Latin America with factors associated with poverty and inequality including childhood infections, stress, environment, nutrition and diet.Recent Findings: Most asthma in childhood in Latin America is nonatopic and has been associated with exposures related to environmental dirt, diet and psychosocial distress. These factors are strongly linked to poverty and inequality. Interestingly, infections with bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens in childhood appear to attenuate atopy in childhood but have no effect on asthma symptoms. There are biologically plausible mechanisms by which dirt exposures (e.g. endotoxin and other microbial products and nonmicrobial irritants), diet and obesity and psychosocial stress may cause airways inflammation.Summary: Most childhood asthma in Latin America is nonatopic for which important risk factors are those of poverty including poor hygiene (i.e. dirt), poor diet and obesity and psychosocial stress. There is evidence that exposures to infections in early childhood reduce atopy but not asthma. Research is needed to identify causes of nonatopic asthma that may be suitable for primary prevention or other public health intervention strategies for asthma in Latin America.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: Over the past 2 years, the number of studies relating vitamin D deficiency and asthma and allergies has increased significantly. The purpose of this review is to update the last review in this journal and examine the evidence of the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and childhood asthma and allergies.Recent Findings: In the past 2 years since the last review, there have been many studies, both cross-sectional and prospective, that have investigated the effects of vitamin D on the inception and severity of asthma and allergies. Most, but not all, studies have shown that low vitamin D levels increase the risk for asthma and allergies, but a few suggest an increased risk with high levels. Results from small trials of short duration suggest that vitamin D supplementation decreases severity of eczema and decreases the risk for asthma exacerbations.Summary: Data that vitamin D deficiency results in increased risks for asthma and allergies continues to accumulate. However, the optimal level of vitamin D that decreases both the risk for development and severity of these disorders remains elusive. Results of ongoing clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation will be needed before recommendations can be firmly established.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Obesity is a chronic condition affecting children worldwide. However, the prevalence is higher in asthmatic children. Obese children most likely become obese adults. Understanding the clinical presentation of this subgroup is essential to their clinical management, now and in the future. This review highlights the most recent findings over the past 18 months in understanding the presentation and potential mechanisms of obesity in childhood asthma. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent research suggests that inhaled corticosteroid efficacy is reduced in obese asthmatic children whereas ventilatory function and bronchoreactivity appear to be marginally affected. A paucity of studies describing airway inflammation and lung volume measurements in this subgroup limits their clinical characterization. Recent studies indicate metabolic abnormalities that typically manifest with excess adiposity may be associated with asthma, providing an interesting factor in the asthma-obesity link. The inception, persistence and composition of obesity prove important considerations for future studies. SUMMARY: Highlighted is the need for more descriptive airway inflammation studies, lung volume assessments and longitudinal studies to better characterize the obese asthma phenotype in children and understand the pathogenesis from childhood to adulthood. Understanding the manifestations and mechanisms of obese asthma in childhood will help direct clinical management and targeted therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models were developed and applied in order to predict the total weekly number of Childhood Asthma Admission (CAA) at the greater Athens area (GAA) in Greece. Hourly meteorological data from the National Observatory of Athens and ambient air pollution data from seven different areas within the GAA for the period 2001–2004 were used. Asthma admissions for the same period were obtained from hospital registries of the three main Children's Hospitals of Athens. Three different ANN models were developed and trained in order to forecast the CAA for the subgroups of 0–4, 5–14-year olds, and for the whole study population. The results of this work have shown that ANNs could give an adequate forecast of the total weekly number of CAA in relation to the bioclimatic and air pollution conditions. The forecasted numbers are in very good agreement with the observed real total weekly numbers of CAA.

AB  - Childhood asthma has rapidly increased over the past few decades, possibly due to changes in lifestyle and dietary patterns. We aimed to determine associations between dietary patterns and asthma in schoolchildren in Taiwan. The Nutrition and Health survey in Taiwan Elementary School Children was carried out by using a multi-staged complex sampling design. A total of 2,082 elementary school children with complete data on dietary, lifestyle, demographics and asthma were included in the analysis. We used a Chinese version of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire to generate an asthma symptom score and to define asthma outcomes. Dietary intake was assessed by a food frequency questionnaire. Reduced rank regression (RRR) was used to identify the dietary pattern associated with the asthma symptoms score. Asthma outcomes included; current asthma, current severe asthma, nocturnal cough, exercise-induced wheeze and asthma ever. The RRR-derived dietary pattern was characterized by high consumption of fast foods, high-fat snacks, candy, and cheese; and low consumption of fruit, vegetables and rice. The RRR-derived dietary pattern was associated with an increased risk of current asthma (OR [95% CI]) (2.42 [1.19-4.93] for Q4/Q1, p-for-trend=0.01), current severe asthma (3.21 [1.11-9.25] for Q3/Q1, 4.45 [1.59-12.5] for Q4/Q1; p-for-trend=0.003), and nocturnal cough (1.79 [1.06-3.05] for Q2/Q1, 1.74 [1.02-2.97] for Q3/Q1, 1.82 [1.07-3.11] for Q4/Q1; p-for-trend=0.049). Our results suggest that a diet with a high intake of fat and simple sugars and low intake of fruit, vegetables and rice is associated with an increased risk of asthma in Taiwanese children.

AB  - Objectives: Exposure to traffic-related air pollutants plays a role in several health outcomes. A large body of evidence tends to link asthma in children with traffic exposure. Increasing asthma prevalence and incidence in children in Canadian cities has been of concern for public health authorities. The following study focuses on estimating the risk of asthma prevalence attributable to residing in proximity to major roads on the Island of Montreal, Canada.Methods: Risk functions pertaining to asthma in children and residential proximity to major roads were selected from the literature and applied to Montreal. Asthma prevalence was taken from population-based studies. Population data were retrieved from Canadian census. Exposure was estimated using the proximity to major road and highway category of the Desktop Mapping Technologies Inc. database (DMTI Spatial Inc.).Results: Based on different studies, the percentage of prevalent asthma cases attributable to residing within 50 metres of a major road or highway for children aged 2, 4 and 6 years varied between 2.4% (0-4.3), 5.6% (0.1-8.6) and 5.9% (0.1-9.0). For the 5-7 year age group residing within 75 m of a major road or highway, the percent of cases was 6.4% (2.6-9.3). For children aged 8 to 10 residing within 75 m of a highway only, the percent of cases was 0.7% (0.2-0.9).Conclusion: These numbers represent the best crude estimates and are an indication of a possible range of cases linked to residential proximity to major roads. As there are uncertainties linked to the application of exposure-response functions, these estimates will be reassessed as new evidence is gathered through further research.

AB  - Objective: To test the hypotheses that reported asthma prevalence is higher among insured than uninsured children and that insurance-based differences in asthma diagnosis, treatment, and health care utilization are associated with disease severity.Data Sources: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2003-2008.Study Design: We used multivariate logistic regression to examine the relationship between insurance and asthma symptom severity with asthma diagnosis, treatment, and acute care utilization.Principal Findings: In multivariate analysis, insured children had greater odds of reporting a current diagnosis of asthma than uninsured children (odds ratio [OR] = 2.08, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.47-2.94). When interactions between insurance and asthma impairment were included, insurance was associated with greater odds of diagnosis among children with intermittent (OR = 4.08, 95% CI: 1.57-10.61), but not persistent, symptoms. Among children with intermittent symptoms, insurance was associated with inhaled corticosteroid use (OR = 4.51, 95% CI: 1.18-17.24) and asthma-related acute care utilization (OR = 5.21, 95% CI: 1.21-23.53); these associations were nonsignificant among children with persistent symptoms.Conclusion: Being insured increases only the likelihood that a child with intermittent, not persistent, asthma symptoms will receive an asthma diagnosis and control medication, and it may not reduce acute care utilization. Although universal insurance may increase detection and management of undiagnosed childhood asthma, theorized cost savings from reduced acute care utilization might not materialize.

AB  - The role of vitamin D in maintaining a healthy pregnancy has seen emerging interest among clinicians and researchers in recent years. The functions of this hormone are widespread and complex, and during pregnancy and breastfeeding it facilitates crucial transfer of calcium from mother to child for skeletal development. Aside from the role of vitamin D in bone development and health, a myriad of other physiological actions are now known, and it is hypothesized that maternal deficiency may increase susceptibility to adverse pregnancy events during pregnancy such as pre-eclampsia. The role of vitamin D in pregnancy and breastfeeding is summarized and applied to the knowledge from studies associating vitamin D deficiency with a range of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including pre-eclampsia and childhood asthma. Current clinical guidelines for vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy are discussed in the context of the available evidence. The need for robust randomized controlled trials to address areas of existing uncertainty is highlighted.

AB  - Abstract: Associations have been reported between suboptimal maternal vitamin E intake during pregnancy and childhood asthma. This pilot study conducted in 2008/2009 investigated the feasibility and acceptability of a food-based randomized controlled trial in pregnant women to optimize dietary vitamin E intake to 15 mg/day. A food-based intervention using “food exchanges” to individually optimize dietary vitamin E intake to 15 mg/day was developed and included in an advice booklet. Forty-three pregnant women with a personal/partner history of asthma were recruited at 12 weeks gestation and randomized to food-based intervention or a control group until 20 weeks gestation. A registered dietitian assessed the vitamin E intake of 22 women and provided tailored advice on food-based exchanges to optimize their intake to 15 mg/day. The 21 control women were not given dietary advice. The food-based intervention was completed by 19 women and increased mean vitamin E intake: food diary data, 7.13 mg/day (95% confidence interval: 5.63 to 18.6) to 17.4 mg/day (95% confidence interval: 14.4 to 20.5) (P<0.001). This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility and acceptability of a food-exchange−based intervention to optimize dietary vitamin E intake during pregnancy. Additional work is required to determine whether this intervention, if sustained for the rest of pregnancy, reduces the likelihood of childhood asthma. The methodology used in the design of this novel food-based intervention could be transferred to other nutrients.

AB  - Objective: The objective of the study was to assess whether folic acid intake during the first trimester of pregnancy is related to asthma in the offspring by the age of 6 years.Study Design: This was a prospective cohort study of 1499 women who were followed up from the first trimester of pregnancy. Their children were followed up until they were 6 years old.Results: Fifty-one percent of the women used folic acid in the month before conception and 88% in the third month of pregnancy. The adjusted odds ratio for asthma per 100 μm increase in the average daily intake of folic acid was 0.98 (95% confidence interval, 0.93-1.04). For categories of daily folate intake, there was no evidence of associations with childhood asthma or evidence of any dose response relation for any time period (all P(trend) > .05).Conclusion: Our results do not support any association of folic acid supplementation in pregnancy and asthma risk in offspring by age 6 years.

AB  - Background: By altering specific developmental signaling pathways that are necessary for fetal lung development, perinatal nicotine exposure affects lung growth and differentiation, resulting in the offsprings' predisposition to childhood asthma; peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonists can inhibit this effect. However, whether the perinatal nicotine-induced asthma risk is restricted to nicotine-exposed offspring only; whether it can be transmitted to the next generation; and whether PPARγ agonists would have any effect on this process are not known.Methods: Time-mated Sprague Dawley rat dams received either placebo or nicotine (1 mg/kg, s.c.), once daily from day 6 of gestation to postnatal day (PND) 21. Following delivery, at PND21, generation 1 (F1) pups were either subjected to pulmonary function tests, or killed to obtain their lungs, tracheas, and gonads to determine the relevant protein markers (mesenchymal contractile proteins), global DNA methylation, histone 3 and 4 acetylation, and for tracheal tension studies. Some F1 animals were used as breeders to generate F2 pups, but without any exposure to nicotine in the F1 pregnancy. At PND21, F2 pups underwent studies similar to those performed on F1 pups.Results: Consistent with the asthma phenotype, nicotine affected lung function in both male and female F1 and F2 offspring (maximal 250% increase in total respiratory system resistance, and 84% maximal decrease in dynamic compliance following methacholine challenge; P < 0.01, nicotine versus control; P < 0.05, males versus females; and P > 0.05, F1 versus F2), but only affected tracheal constriction in males (51% maximal increase in tracheal constriction following acetylcholine challenge, P < 0.01, nicotine versus control; P < 0.0001, males versus females; P > 0.05, F1 versus F2); nicotine also increased the contractile protein content of whole lung (180% increase in fibronectin protein levels, P < 0.01, nicotine versus control, and P < 0.05, males versus females) and isolated lung fibroblasts (for example, 45% increase in fibronectin protein levels, P < 0.05, nicotine versus control), along with decreased PPARγ expression (30% decrease, P < 0.05, nicotine versus control), but only affected contractile proteins in the male trachea (P < 0.05, nicotine versus control, and P < 0.0001, males versus females). All of the nicotine-induced changes in the lung and gonad DNA methylation and histone 3 and 4 acetylation were normalized by the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone except for the histone 4 acetylation in the lung.Conclusions: Germline epigenetic marks imposed by exposure to nicotine during pregnancy can become permanently programmed and transferred through the germline to subsequent generations, a ground-breaking finding that shifts the current asthma paradigm, opening up many new avenues to explore.

AB  - Background: Asthma is one of the major chronic health problems in children in the Netherlands. The Pelican is a paediatric asthma-related quality of life instrument for children with asthma from 6-11 years old, which is suitable for clinical practice in primary and specialized care. Based on this instrument, we developed a self-management treatment to improve asthma-related quality of life. The Pelican intervention will be investigated in different health care settings. Results of intervention studies are often extrapolated to other health care settings than originally investigated. Because of differences in organization, disease severity, patient characteristics and care provision between health care settings, extrapolating research results could lead to unnecessary health costs without the desired health care achievements. Therefore, interventions have to be investigated in different health care settings when possible. This study is an example of an intervention study in different health care settings. In this article, we will present the study protocol of the Pelican study in primary and specialized care.Method/design: This study consists of two randomized controlled trials to assess the effectiveness of the Pelican intervention in primary and specialized care. The trial in primary care is a multilevel design with 170 children with asthma in 16 general practices. All children in one general practices are allocated to the same treatment group. The trial in specialized care is a multicentre trial with 100 children with asthma. Children in one outpatient clinic are randomly allocated to the intervention or usual care group. In both trials, children will visit the care provider four times during a follow-up of nine months. This study is registered and ethically approved.Discussion: This article describes the study protocol of the Pelican study in different health care settings. If the Pelican intervention proves to be effective and efficient, implementation in primary and specialized care for paediatric asthma in the Netherlands will be recommended.Trial Registration: This study is registered by clinicaltrial.gov (NCT01109745).

AB  - Background: The prevalence of asthma in industrialized countries has been increasing dramatically and asthma is now the most common chronic disease of children in the United States. The rapidity of the increase strongly suggests that changes in environmental exposures are the likely cause of this epidemic. Further, the early onset of allergic manifestations suggests that these exposures may act on the prenatal development of the immune system. We have focused on the potential effects of bisphenol A (BPA), a chemical pollutant with one of the largest productions, on the development of childhood asthma. We have reported that perinatal BPA exposure promotes the development of allergic asthma in a mouse model. The current study was designed to identify a critical period of BPA exposure and to begin elucidating the mechanisms for this susceptibility.Methods: Female BALB/c mice received 10 micro g/ml BPA in their drinking water from one week before pregnancy until the end of the study. Some of the pups were transferred in the first 48 h of life from their BPA-loaded mother to an unexposed mother, or vice versa. Half of the pups were sensitized with a low dose of the experimental allergen ovalbumin (OVA), the rest received PBS as an unsensitized controls. On day 22, the pups were challenged by inhalations of ovalbumin or PBS followed by quantification of eosinophils in and hyperreactivity of their airways, major indicators of experimental asthma in this classical mouse model. Hepatic expression of two isoforms of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (Ugt) was quantified by quantitative RT-PCR at various ages.Results: Pups exposed to BPA in utero and through breast milk, or in utero only, displayed an asthma phenotype in response to their "suboptimal" allergic sensitization, whereas, pups only exposed to BPA postnatally from breast milk, did not. The expression of Ugt2b1, an isoform related to BPA clearance in rats, was not detectable in mouse fetuses and newborn pups, but increased by day 5 and approached adult levels by day 25.Conclusions: Prenatal exposures that produce environmentally relevant burdens of BPA, followed by postnatal allergic sensitization and challenges, promote the development of experimental allergic asthma. Delayed expression of BPA-metabolizing enzymes may explain, at least in part, the enhanced fetal susceptibility to this common environmental contaminant.

AB  - Maximal expiratory flow-volume (MEFV) curves of pediatric patients are investigated using differentiation schemes and by computing their second derivative, d²V /dV². Results show that spirometric tracings illustrate a characteristic well-defined behavior, where two distinct regions of the MEFV curve may be identified: (1) a concave profile during the initial expiratory maneuver, and (2) a convex profile over the greater lower region of the descending phase of the MEFV curve; this latter region is characterized by an approximately constant positive value of d²V /dV² such that the descending MEFV limb may be captured by a quadratic function. Based on simple expiratory flow modeling, we show that d²V /dV², and alternatively the local geometrical curvature ?(V), yield a measure of the relative degree of flow obstruction. In view of future clinical applications, we make use of an 'average curvature index', to assist clinician's assessment of asthma severity, by quantifying curvature and summarizing global information in MEFV curves.

AB  - Background: In clinical trials in childhood asthma, outcomes reflecting short-term disease activity are frequently measured, whilst functional status, quality of life (QoL), and long-term treatment effects are rarely assessed. There is also non-uniformity across studies in the selection and measurement of outcomes within these domains. The development of a core outcome set has the potential to reduce heterogeneity between trials, lead to research that is more likely to have measured relevant outcomes, and enhance the value of evidence synthesis by reducing the risk of outcome reporting bias and ensuring that all trials contribute usable information.Methods: Paediatricians and specialist nurses, identified through the British Paediatric Respiratory Society, completed a two-round Delphi survey. Separate cohorts of parents of children younger than 18 years, recruited in clinics, participated in each round. Young people with asthma, aged at least 13 years, participated in the first round. Outcomes were identified separately for preschool and school-aged children.We identified outcomes considered important in routine clinical assessment by clinicians and parents/young people. In round 1, 46 clinicians suggested outcomes they considered important when deciding whether to adjust a child's asthma therapy regime, and 49 parents/young people were asked, using open questions, how they judged whether their child's (for young people, their own) asthma therapy was appropriate. Two researchers independently classified responses into appropriate, corresponding outcomes.In round 2, 43 clinicians and 50 parents scored, from 0-4, the importance of each outcome suggested by at least 10 % of round 1 responders and selected the three most important.Results: The most important outcomes, when making shared decisions about regular therapies for school-aged and preschool children with asthma, were daytime and nocturnal symptoms, exacerbations, QoL, and mortality. Results from parents and clinicians were generally concordant, but parents placed more emphasis on long-term treatment effects.Conclusions: We have developed a methodology to identify outcomes of most relevance to clinicians, parents, and young people when evaluating regularly administered therapies for asthma. Daytime and nocturnal symptoms, exacerbations, QoL, and mortality are particularly important outcomes that should be measured and reported in all clinical trials of regular therapies for children with asthma.

AB  - Rationale: Ambient particulate matter concentrations have been positively associated with urinary leukotriene E(4) (LTE(4)) levels and albuterol usage in children with asthma but interactions with environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure have not been demonstrated despite obvious exposure to both pollutants in an urban setting.Objectives: To assess the health effects of concurrent ETS and ambient particulate matter exposure in children with asthma.Methods: Albuterol usage and LTE(4) levels were monitored in 82 urban schoolchildren with asthma over three consecutive fall to spring school periods. Concentrations of morning maximum ambient particulate matter <2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (mmPM(2.5)) and urine cotinine levels were also measured daily.Measurements and Main Results: Albuterol usage and LTE(4) were related to mmPM(2.5) concentrations on days when urine cotinine levels were low (<10 ng/ml/mg creatinine); on these days, mean albuterol usage and LTE(4) increased up to 5 or 6% per 10 μg/m(3) increase in mmPM(2.5). In contrast, no significant relationship was observed when cotinine was high, although mean albuterol usage and LTE(4) levels were greater in this case. Model fits for LTE(4) levels as a function of mmPM(2.5) concentrations were improved when mmPM(2.5) concentrations were logged, suggesting a nonlinear dose-response relationship between particulate matter exposure concentrations and airway mediators of asthma, for which the relationship tends to flatten at higher concentrations.Conclusions: This study suggests that ETS modifies the acute effects of low-level ambient PM(2.5) exposure on childhood asthma. This negative interaction, the smaller effect of particulate matter exposure in children exposed to higher ETS, may be related to a nonlinear dose-response relationship between asthma mediators and particulate exposures.

AB  - Objectives. The Community Action to Fight Asthma Initiative, a network of coalitions and technical assistance providers in California, employed an environmental justice approach to reduce risk factors for asthma in school-aged children. Policy advocacy focused on housing, schools, and outdoor air quality. Technical assistance partners from environmental science, policy advocacy, asthma prevention, and media assisted in advocacy. An evaluation team assessed progress and outcomes. Methods. A theory of change and corresponding logic model were used to document coalition development and successes. Site visits, surveys, policymaker interviews, and participation in meetings documented the processes and outcomes. Quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed to assess strategies, successes, and challenges. Results. Coalitions, working with community residents and technical assistance experts, successfully advocated for policies to reduce children's exposures to environmental triggers, particularly in low-income communities and communities of color. Policies were implemented at various levels. Conclusions. Environmental justice approaches to policy advocacy could be an effective strategy to address inequities across communities. Strong technical assistance, close community involvement, and multilevel strategies were all essential to effective policies to reduce environmental inequities.

AB  - A nurse with a history of childhood asthma describes her experiences with intubation and mechanical ventilation. It is important for nurses to recognize that mechanical ventilation is very stressful for patients and for the patients' families. It is essential for nurses to keep the patient as the focus of their care. A key part of that focus is to reorient patients who are receiving mechanical ventilation frequently.

AB  - Background: Studies conducted in transitional communities from Africa and Asia have pointed to the process of urbanisation as being responsible for the increase in asthma prevalence in developing regions. In Latin America, there are few published data available on the potential impact of urbanisation on asthma prevalence. The aim of the present study was to explore how the process of urbanisation may explain differences in asthma prevalence in transitional communities in north-eastern Ecuador.Methodology/principal Findings: An ecological study was conducted in 59 communities in Esmeraldas Province, Ecuador. Indicators of urbanisation were grouped into three indices representing the processes associated with urbanisation: socioeconomic, lifestyle and urban infrastructure. Categorical principal components analysis was used to generate scores for each index and a fourth index--a summary urbanisation index--was derived from the most representative variables in each of the three indices. The authors analysed the associations between community asthma prevalence and the indices, as well as with each indicator variable of every group. The overall prevalence of asthma was 10.1% (range 0-31.4% between communities). Three of the four indices presented significant associations with community asthma prevalence: socioeconomic (r = 0.295, p = 0.023), lifestyle (r = 0.342, p = 0.008) and summary urbanisation index (r = 0.355, p = 0.006). Variables reflecting better socioeconomic status and a more urban lifestyle were associated with greater asthma prevalence.Conclusions: These data provide evidence that the prevalence of asthma increases with increasing levels of urbanisation in transitional communities, and factors associated with greater socioeconomic level and changes towards a more urban lifestyle may be particularly important.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Exposure to environments rich in microorganisms such as farms has been shown to protect against the development of childhood asthma and allergies. However, it remains unclear where, and how, farm and other rural children are exposed to microbes. Furthermore, the composition of the microbial flora is poorly characterised. We tested the hypothesis that farm children are exposed indoors to substantial levels of viable microbes originating from animal sheds and barns. We also expected that environmental microbial flora on farms and in farm homes would be more complex than in the homes of rural control children. METHODS: Dust samples were collected using passive samplers in the bedrooms of the following groups of children in rural Bavaria, Germany: (i) those living on farms (n=144), (ii) those regularly exposed to farm environments but not living on farms (n=149) and (iii) those never visiting farms (n=150). For farm children, additional samples were collected in animal sheds and barns. All samples were subjected to fungal and bacterial culturing. RESULTS: Detectable levels of microorganisms were more often found in samples taken from farm dwellings than from other homes. Farm dwellings also showed higher microbial levels. Microbial counts of farm dwelling samples correlated with the counts in corresponding animal sheds and barns. CONCLUSIONS: Microorganisms are transported from animal sheds and barns into farm dwellings. Therefore, children living in these environments are exposed when indoors and when visiting animal sheds and barns. Indoor exposure may also contribute to the protective effect of the farm environment.

AB  - We report five cases of asthma unmasked by anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-blocking drugs. Asthma symptoms appeared within an average of 4 months (range 1-24 months) after starting the anti-TNF-α treatment for inflammatory disease. The patients did not appear to be predisposed to asthma except for one patient who had asthma during childhood. Four patients stopped anti-TNF-α-blocking drugs with an improvement of symptoms within 1 to 5 months. In the patient with a history of childhood asthma, respiratory symptoms recurred when another anti-TNF-α therapy was started. Asthma control was achieved with inhaled steroids, allowing anti-TNF-α treatment to continue. The biotherapy was maintained for the fifth patient in association with inhaled steroids. The pathophysiologic mechanisms are unknown but are probably more complex than the T helper 1/T helper 2 imbalance suggested in the literature, and further studies are required.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This randomised controlled trial evaluates the immediate effects of acupuncture as an add-on therapy in in-patient rehabilitation of children and adolescents with bronchial asthma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a pre-post design, the severity of symptoms, lung function, illness-specific quality of life (Paediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire - PAQLQ) and general and asthma-specific level of anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children - STAIC) were investigated in 46 acupuncture and 47 control patients. In addition to asthma sports, climate therapy and behavioural training, the intervention group received acupuncture treatment with a standardised needle pattern (12x 30min.). RESULTS: With acupuncture, the peak expiratory flow variability differs significantly (p<0.01) from that of the control patients' group. Moreover, the acupuncture group differs significantly in their rehabilitation response at the time of discharge concerning perceived anxiety (STAIC-S). The lung function tests do not present differences between groups. CONCLUSION: After additional acupuncture, amelioration of peak expiratory flow variability and anxiety can be shown, without any difference in objective lung function tests and quality of life between study groups. Further studies might evaluate the effects of acupuncture on childhood asthma in an outpatient setting.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To identify and discuss recent studies relating prenatal and early-life environmental exposures to the development of asthma and allergic disease. RECENT FINDINGS: New studies show that prenatal and early-life stress can alter infant immune profiles, increasing risk for asthma and allergy. Mounting evidence implicates indoor and outdoor air pollution in the origins of allergic disease, while Vitamin D intake and a Mediterranean diet may be protective. The role of early-life fever and infection remain controversial, with recent studies yielding conflicting results and new evidence indicating that previous studies may have been confounded. New studies are increasingly focused on environmental 'imprinting' of the infant gut microbiota, which is a critical determinant of immune system development. Early exposures impacting the intestinal microbiota include mode of delivery, infant diet, and use of antibiotics - factors that are also associated with childhood asthma and allergic disease. SUMMARY: This overview highlights environmental exposures during the in-utero and ex-utero time periods that are potential stimuli for the early programming of asthma and allergy. Special consideration is given for the potential role of intestinal microbiota. Future studies in this field promise to inform health policy and intervention strategies for the prevention of asthma and allergic disease.

AB  - Appalachia's River and non-River Bordering Counties. Children living in Ohio's Appalachian counties that border the Ohio River are disproportionally exposed to adverse environmental conditions prevalent along the river that may contribute to disparities in health, access to care and care utilization. This study examined if there were differences in health, access to care and care utilization between Ohio's Appalachian children living in counties that border the Ohio River and those living in counties that do not border the river. A secondary analysis of the 28 Appalachian counties from Ohio's 88 counties included in the 2008 Ohio Family Health Survey was conducted using a Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling strategy. Descriptive analyses comparing geographic groups across demographic, health, access, utilization, and health insurance also were conducted. Childhood asthma was more prevalent in the river-bordering counties (16.4%) compared to the non-river counties (9.4%). Children with asthma had more sere symptoms in the river bordering counties (8.2%) compared to the non-river bordering counties (4.4%). Children residing in river bordering counties had higher rates of obesity (24.4%) and overweight (17%). After controlling for child health and insurance status, children living in the river bordering counties had less access to care (est. −7.14, CI = −17.3,0.74) and more difficulty accessing specialty care. Children residing in the non-river counties had more sickness care utilization (est. 0.25, CI = 0.01, 0.49). Regardless of region, children with a regular health care provider and place for care were healthier. Differences in child health, access to care and utilization of services exist within Ohio's Appalachian region.

AB  - Objectives Environmental exposure at home, such as dampness, has been shown to have adverse effects on respiratory health. However, few studies explored the association between home dampness and genetic polymorphisms on childhood asthma. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of home dampness and tumour necrosis factor-[alpha] gene (TNF-[alpha]) on asthma in Taiwanese children. Methods The authors investigated 3810 schoolchildren in Taiwan Children Health Study from 14 communities. Children's exposure and disease status were measured from a parental questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression models were fitted to estimate the effects of home dampness exposure and TNF-[alpha] genotypes on the prevalence of asthma and wheeze. Results Mildewy odour at home was significantly associated with increased prevalence of lifetime wheeze (OR=1.36, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.77, p for trend=0.04). The effects of water stamp on the wall at home were associated with lifetime asthma and lifetime wheeze. Children with water stamp on the wall at home and TNF-308 A allele had increased risks on lifetime asthma, active asthma and lifetime wheeze. TNF-[alpha] showed significant interactive effects with mildewy odour on lifetime asthma (p for interaction=0.01), and with water stamp on the wall at home on lifetime wheeze (p for interaction=0.04). Under stratification by TNF-308 genotypes, we found that the frequency of water stamp on the wall was associated with increased risks of all asthma subcategories and lifetime wheeze among TNF-308 GA or AA genotypes (p for trend<0.05). Conclusions Home dampness is a risk factor for asthma and wheeze among children, especially for those with the TNF-308 A allele.

AB  - Background: The adverse respiratory effects of ground-level ozone are well established. Ozone is the air pollutant most consistently projected to increase under future climate change.Purpose: To project future pediatric asthma emergency department visits associated with ground-level ozone changes, comparing 1990s to 2020s.Methods: This study assessed future numbers of asthma emergency department visits for children aged 0-17 years using (1) baseline New York City metropolitan area emergency department rates; (2) a dose-response relationship between ozone levels and pediatric asthma emergency department visits; and (3) projected daily 8-hour maximum ozone concentrations for the 2020s as simulated by a global-to-regional climate change and atmospheric chemistry model. Sensitivity analyses included population projections and ozone precursor changes. This analysis occurred in 2010.Results: In this model, climate change could cause an increase in regional summer ozone-related asthma emergency department visits for children aged 0-17 years of 7.3% across the New York City metropolitan region by the 2020s. This effect diminished with inclusion of ozone precursor changes. When population growth is included, the projections of morbidity related to ozone are even larger.Conclusions: The results of this analysis demonstrate that the use of regional climate and atmospheric chemistry models make possible the projection of local climate change health effects for specific age groups and specific disease outcomes, such as emergency department visits for asthma. Efforts should be made to improve on this type of modeling to inform local and wider-scale climate change mitigation and adaptation policy.

AB  - The lung is a highly complex organ that can only be understood by integrating the many aspects of its structure. There is increasing interest in defining childhood asthma phenotypes, following decades of research into understanding mechanisms of asthma development and their genetic background without significant breakthroughs. Despite the medical profession's best efforts to define asthma, identify risk factors and natural development of asthma in birth cohorts, and find characteristics that distinguish one type of asthma from another, we still do not know the relevant characteristics of the various subgroups of childhood asthma. This review will briefly describe the importance of identifying childhood asthma phenotypes, the observable characteristics of the disease, and the previous and current approaches used to find them.

AB  - Background: The "Dutch hypothesis" suggests that asthma and COPD have common genetic determinants. The serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade E (nexin, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1), member 2 (SERPINE2) gene previously has been associated with COPD. We sought to determine whether SERPINE2 is associated with asthma and asthma-related phenotypes.Methods: We measured the association of 39 SERPINE2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with asthma-related phenotypes in 655 parent-child trios from the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP), and we measured the association of 19 SERPINE2 SNPs with asthma in a case-control design of 359 CAMP probands and 846 population control subjects. We attempted to replicate primary asthma-related phenotype findings in one independent population and primary asthma affection status findings in two independent populations. We compared association results with CAMP proband expression quantitative trait loci.Results: Nine of 39 SNPs had P < .05 for at least one phenotype in CAMP, and two of these replicated in an independent population of 426 people with childhood asthma. Six of 19 SNPs had P < .05 for association with asthma in CAMP/Illumina. None of these replicated in two independent populations. The expression quantitative trait loci revealed that five SNPs associated with asthma in CAMP/Illumina and one SNP associated with FEV(1) in CAMP are strongly correlated with SERPINE2 expression levels. Comparison of results to previous COPD studies identified five SNPs associated with both asthma- and COPD-related phenotypes.Conclusions: Our results weakly support SERPINE2 as a Dutch hypothesis candidate gene through nominally significant associations with asthma and related traits. Further study of SERPINE2 is necessary to verify its involvement in asthma and COPD.

AB  - Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infects all children early in life, is the most common cause of infant lower respiratory tract infections, and causes disease exacerbations in children with asthma. Episodes of lower respiratory tract infection in early life are associated with asthma development. Whether RSV infection early in life directly causes asthma or simply identifies infants who are genetically predisposed to develop subsequent wheezing is debatable. Recent studies suggest that these two explanations are not mutually exclusive, and are likely both important in asthma development. An open-label study of RSV immunoprophylaxis administered to preterm infants reduced recurrent wheezing by 50%. Clinical trials of infant RSV prevention, delay or severity reduction on the outcome of childhood asthma would confirm the causal relationship between RSV infection and asthma, and offer a primary prevention strategy.

AB  - Aims: To study the association between childhood snoring and cardiovascular risk factors. Methods: Cross-sectional analyses of a population-based birth cohort, who had been participants in a randomised controlled trial of interventions to prevent asthma and who were assessed at age 8 years. The presence and frequency of snoring were assessed by parent-completed questionnaire. We measured a wide range of cardiovascular function markers including non-fasting serum lipoproteins, blood pressure, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, carotid artery intima media thickness (by ultrasound), brachial pulse wave velocity and augmentation index (by applanation tonometry). Results: Of 409 children whose snoring status was assessed at age 8 years, 321 had lipid and 386 had arterial structure and function measurements. Snoring was not independently associated with blood pressure, carotid artery intima media thickness or measures of arterial stiffness (all P > 0.05). Increasing snoring frequency was independently associated with lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-0.032 g/dL per step, 95% confidence interval -0.060 to -0.003), although the difference in high-density lipoprotein between snorers and non-snorers was not significant (P = 0.052). An association of snoring frequency with brachial pulse wave velocity differed according to body mass index (P = 0.03) and was the reverse of that expected. Conclusions: Parentally reported snoring was not independently associated with adverse measurements of metabolic markers, vascular structure or function in 8-year-old children. Parental reports of snoring may be below the treatment threshold without additional diagnosis via sleep studies.

AB  - Background: Asthma therapy is typically prescribed and titrated based on patient or parent self-report of symptoms. No longitudinal studies have assessed the relationship between symptoms and severe asthma exacerbations in children. The goal of our study was (1) to assess the association of asthma symptoms with severe asthma exacerbations and (2) to compare predictors of persistent asthma symptoms and predictors of severe asthma exacerbations.Methods: The Childhood Asthma Management Program was a multicenter clinical trial of 1,041 children randomized to receive budesonide, nedocromil, or placebo (as-needed β-agonist). We conducted a post hoc analysis of diary cards that were completed by subjects on a daily basis to categorize subjects as having persistent vs intermittent symptoms. We defined a severe asthma exacerbation as an episode requiring ≥ 3 days use of oral corticosteroids, hospitalization, or ED visit due to asthma based on self-report at study visits every 4 months.Results: While accounting for longitudinal measures, having persistent symptoms from asthma was significantly associated with having severe asthma exacerbations. Predictors of having persistent symptoms compared with intermittent symptoms included not being treated with inhaled corticosteroids, lower FEV(1)/FVC ratio, and a lower natural logarithm of provocative concentration of methacholine producing a 20% decline in FEV(1) (lnPC(20)). Predictors of having one or more severe asthma exacerbations included younger age, history of hospitalization or ED visit in the prior year, ≥ 3 days use of oral corticosteroids in the prior 3 months, lower FEV(1)/FVC ratio, lower lnPC(20), and higher logarithm to the base 10 eosinophil count; treatment with inhaled corticosteroids was predictive of having no severe asthma exacerbations.Conclusions: Patients with persistent symptoms from asthma were more likely to experience severe asthma exacerbations. Nevertheless, demographic and laboratory predictors of having persistent symptoms are different from predictors of severe asthma exacerbations. Although symptoms and exacerbations are closely related, their predictors are different. The current focus of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines on the two separate domains of asthma control, impairment and risk, are supported by our analysis.

AB  - Background: Bronchial asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease, which causes recurrent episodes of dyspnoea, wheezing and cough. It is estimated that 10% of children suffer from asthma, and an asthmatic crisis may be a life-threatening event for the young patients. Aim: Literature review of the role of the nurse in the current management of childhood bronchial asthma in the community. Method: A literature search using the Medline, Cinahl and Cochrane databases was made for the period 1.11.2010 to 1.2.2011 using specific key words related to asthma management: Nurse, paediatric bronchial asthma, family, care, parents. Results: Most parents do not have adequate knowledge to enable them to recognize the onset of an asthmatic attack and its trigger factor, and they cannot assess the severity correctly. Many health professionals do not assess properly the severity of an asthmatic crisis, which is often underestimated. The appropriate use of inhalants, nebulizers and other devices, in combination with the removal of environmental allergens, along with education of the family, are the cornerstones of care of the child with asthma. Barriers to effective care of childhood asthma include the persistence of environmental factors, socioeconomic and cultural factors, and fluctuations in the quality of care provided by health professionals. Conclusions: Bronchial asthma is a common and serious health problem of childhood. Community intervention, and in particular family education, constitute a critical focus for the prevention and management of childhood asthma.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Outpatient asthma management remains suboptimal. We previously reported significant improvements in asthma guideline adherence and outcomes in children by using quality-improvement processes and community health workers. We hypothesized that a larger project could achieve comparable outcome improvements with streamlined quality-improvement processes and decreased technical assistance. METHODS: Seventeen clinics treating 12 000 children with asthma were evaluated through interviews of a subset of patients with persistent or high-risk asthma (n= 761) at baseline and at 12 and 21 months and chart reviews randomly selected from all patients with asthma at baseline and 12 and 24 months (n = 2040). Multidisciplinary teams developed data- driven continuous quality-improvement activities. Asthma coordinators provided patient education and were active team members. RESULTS: Study children were predominantly Hispanic (77%) and black (11%); 60% were enrolled in Medicaid, and 9% were uninsured. Comparing results between baseline and the 21-month follow-up, significantly fewer families reported emergency-department visits (29.6% vs 9.3%), hospitalizations (10.9% vs 3.4%), frequent daytime symptoms (44.0% vs 11.7%), and missed school days (28.7% vs 13.6%); significantly more reported confidence in asthma management (70.6% vs 95.5%); and quality-of-life scores increased significantly for both children and caregivers (all P < .05). Cross-sectional data revealed significant clinic-wide improvements in symptom documentation, health care use, and review of action plans. CONCLUSIONS: On a larger scale, this approach realized impressive changes in provider clinical practice associated with major improvements in health outcomes. It holds great potential for significantly reducing asthma- related morbidity among low-income children.

AB  - Abstract: Much has been written about the role of dietary acculturation in the epidemic of obesity among Hispanic immigrants in the United States. Yet little is known about the role of beliefs and preferences in immigrants’ dietary practices and their relationship to the retail food environment in which the practices occur. We conducted a mixed-methods convergence study of these issues. Twenty-eight foreign-born Hispanic adult women, recruited from families enrolled in a childhood asthma study and mainly living in New York City took part in 60–90 min, semi-structured interviews regarding their dietary beliefs, preferences, and practices. The findings were then used to formulate hypotheses for analyses of food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) data collected from the 345 New York Hispanic women enrolled in the asthma study. Generalized estimating equations were used to determine whether characteristics of the retail food environment within 0.5 km of the home predicted diet, adjusting for individual and neighborhood socio-demographic characteristics. In the interviews, healthy food was rarely discussed in terms of nutritional content. Instead, considerations of freshness, as indicated by time since harvest or slaughter and thus local sourcing; purity, as indicated by the absence of preservatives and processing; and naturalness, as indicated by chemical free farming practices, were the primary axes around which healthy food was defined. Quantitative results were consistent with the qualitative findings: 1) the presence of a farmers’ market within the home neighborhood was associated with consumption of more total servings per day of fruit, vegetables, and juice, and 2) the presence of a farmers’ market and/or a livestock market was associated with consumption of more servings per day of meat. Proximity to supermarkets or medium-sized grocery stores was not associated with consumption. The results suggest that the availability of fresh produce and meat from local farms may influence diet among Hispanic women in urban neighborhoods.

AB  - Background: Urban children represent a group at high risk for asthma development and adverse asthma outcomes. Although rural children also encounter sociodemographic disparities that might be expected to worsen asthma, asthma in the rural United States is poorly studied.Objectives: To determine rural-urban differences in childhood asthma diagnosis and morbidity.Methods: We studied a statewide population of 117,080 children continuously enrolled in Tennessee Medicaid from birth through the sixth year of life, using linked Tennessee Medicaid, vital records, and pharmacy claims databases to determine asthma diagnosis and residence.Results: The cohort was 45% urban, 23% suburban, and 33% rural. Compared with urban children, rural children were more likely to be white, have a history of bronchiolitis, and have mothers who smoked. Eleven percent of urban, 12% of suburban, and 13% of rural children met study criteria for asthma diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio for rural children, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.24; adjusted odds ratio for suburban children, 1.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-1.30; with urban as the referent; P < .001). Rural children had greater use of outpatient asthma care, whereas urban children had greater use of inhaled corticosteroids. Compared with urban children, rural children had fewer asthma emergency department visits but were hospitalized for asthma at similar rates and had similar use of asthma rescue medications.Conclusion: In this pediatric Medicaid population, rural children had increased asthma prevalence and similar asthma morbidity compared with urban children but differences in patterns of asthma care and resource use, suggesting that optimal interventions for asthma may differ in rural compared with urban populations.

AB  - Introduction Observational studies report inverse associations between the use of feather upper bedding (pillow and/or quilt) and asthma symptoms but there is no randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence assessing the role of feather upper bedding as a secondary prevention measure. Objective To determine whether, among children not using feather upper bedding, a new feather pillow and feather quilt reduces asthma severity among house dust mite (HDM) sensitised children with asthma over a 1-year period compared with standard dust mite avoidance advice, and giving children a new mite-occlusive mattress cover. Design RCT. Setting The Calvary Hospital in the Australian Capital Territory and the Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, New South Wales. Patients 197 children with HDM sensitisation and moderate to severe asthma. Intervention New upper bedding duck feather pillow and quilt and a mite-occlusive mattress cover (feather) versus standard care and a mite-occlusive mattress cover (standard). Main outcome measures The proportion of children reporting four or more episodes of wheeze in the past year; an episode of speech-limiting wheeze; or one or more episodes of sleep disturbance caused by wheezing; and spirometry with challenge testing. Statistical analysis included multiple logistic and linear regression. Results No differences between groups were found for primary end points - frequent wheeze (OR 1.51, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.76, p=0.17), speech-limiting wheeze (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.48, p=0.35), sleep disturbed because of wheezing (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.13, p=0.61) or for any secondary end points. Secondary analyses indicated the intervention reduced the risk of sleep being disturbed because of wheezing and severe wheeze to a greater extent for children who slept supine. Conclusion No differences in respiratory symptoms or lung function were observed 1 year after children with moderate-severe asthma and HDM sensitisation were given a mite-occlusive mattress cover and then received either feather upper bedding (pillow and quilt) or standard bedding care.

AB  - Background: Folic acid supplementation has an established role in early pregnancy for preventing neural tube defects. However, there is controversy over a possible link between late pregnancy folic acid supplementation and childhood asthma.Objective: To review the evidence exploring the association between maternal folate exposure in pregnancy and childhood asthma or wheeze.Results: Four relevant observational studies were identified. Two found statistically significant associations between childhood asthma and late (but not early) pregnancy maternal folic acid exposure. Another found a statistically significant association between childhood wheeze and early (but not late) pregnancy maternal folic acid exposure. A fourth study found little association between maternal dietary folate in pregnancy and infantile wheeze.Discussion: The currently available evidence regarding an association between folate in pregnancy and childhood asthma or wheeze is conflicting. We offer suggestions for discussing the potential risk with patients and recommend further research on this subject be conducted.

AB  - There are conflicting reports about the benefits of zinc supplements in childhood asthma. This study examined the effect of zinc supplementation in children with asthma attending an outpatient clinic in Sari, Islamic Republic of Iran. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial over 8 weeks, 284 children on inhaled steroids were allocated to receive zinc supplements (50 mg/day) (n = 144) or placebo (n = 140). Cases and controls had low initial serum zinc concentrations [61.8 (SD 7.3) µg/dL and 60.9 (SD 4.3) µg/dL]. After treatment, mean serum zinc level in the case group was significantly higher [129 (SD 20.4) µg/dL] than in the controls [63 (SD 8.6) µg/dL]. There were no significant differences in IgE levels before and after treatment. The case group showed significant improvements in clinical symptoms such as cough, wheezing and dyspnoea and in all spirometry parameters (FVC, FEV1 and FEV1/FVC).

AB  - CONTEXT: The increasing prevalence of childhood asthma has been associated with low microbial exposure as described by the hygiene hypothesis. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the evidence of association between antibiotic exposure during pregnancy or in the first year of life and risk of childhood asthma. METHODS: PubMed was systematically searched for studies published between 1950 and July 1, 2010. Those that assessed associations between antibiotic exposure during pregnancy or in the first year of life and asthma at ages 0 to 18 years (for pregnancy exposures) or ages 3 to 18 years (for first-year-of-life exposures) were included. Validity was assessed according to study design, age at asthma diagnosis, adjustment for respiratory infections, and consultation rates. RESULTS: For exposure in the first year of life, the pooled odds ratio (OR) for all studies (N = 20) was 1.52 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.30-1.77). Retrospective studies had the highest pooled risk estimate for asthma (OR: 2.04 [95% CI: 1.83-2.27]; n = 8) compared with database and prospective studies (OR: 1.25 [95% CI: 1.08-1.45]; n = 12). Risk estimates for studies that adjusted for respiratory infections (pooled OR: 1.16 [95% CI: 1.08-1.25]; n = 5) or later asthma onset (pooled OR for asthma at or after 2 years: OR: 1.16 [95% CI: 1.06-1.25]; n = 3) were weaker but remained significant. For exposure during pregnancy (n = 3 studies), the pooled OR was 1.24 (95% CI: 1.02-1.50). CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotics seem to slightly increase the risk of childhood asthma. Reverse causality and protopathic bias seem to be possible confounders for this relationship.

AB  - Background: The environment is suspected to play an important role in the development of childhood asthma. Cohort studies are a powerful observational design for studying exposure-response relationships, but their power depends in part upon the accuracy of the exposure assessment. Objective: The purpose of this paper is to summarize and discuss issues that make accurate exposure assessment a challenge and to suggest strategies for improving exposure assessment in longitudinal cohort studies of childhood asthma and allergies. Data synthesis: Exposures of interest need to be prioritized, because a single study cannot measure all potentially relevant exposures. Hypotheses need to be based on proposed mechanisms, critical time windows for effects, prior knowledge of physical, physiologic, and immunologic development, as well as genetic pathways potentially influenced by the exposures. Modifiable exposures are most important from the public health perspective. Given the interest in evaluating gene-environment interactions, large cohort sizes are required, and planning for data pooling across independent studies is critical. Collection of additional samples, possibly through subject participation, will permit secondary analyses. Models combining air quality, environmental, and dose data provide exposure estimates across large cohorts but can still be improved. Conclusions: Exposure is best characterized through a combination of information sources. Improving exposure assessment is critical for reducing measurement error and increasing power, which increase confidence in characterization of children at risk, leading to improved health outcomes.

AB  - Background: Epidemiologic studies indicate that exposure to air pollution caused by traffic may have an association with an increased risk of childhood asthma. Some studies report an association between the polymorphisms of the microsomal epoxide hydroxylase (EPHX1) gene and enzyme activity. We investigated the associations of EPHX1 Tyr113His and His139Arg polymorphisms with asthma and wheezing outcomes, and focused on the functional genetic change in different ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) levels on glutathione S-transferase p1 (GSTP1) and glutathione S-transferase m1 (GSTM1) genotypes.Methods: A total of 3,741 children were enrolled in the Taiwan Children Health Study from 14 communities. We examined the associations of EPHX1 Tyr113His and His139Arg genotypes and diplotypes with asthma and wheezing outcomes under different ambient NO₂ exposures.Results: Children with the EPHX1 Arg/His or Arg/Arg genotypes at codon 139 were significantly associated with increased risks of lifetime asthma (adjusted OR [aOR] = 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.7; and aOR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.1, respectively). The EPHX1 diplotypes showed significant associations with lifetime asthma (global P value = .01) and early-onset asthma (global P value = .01). The risk of EPHX1 139Arg allele and 113Tyr-139Arg diplotype were of greater magnitude in higher compared with lower NO₂ communities. The increase of the effect from the EPHX1 139Arg allele with higher NO₂ exposure was most marked in the GSTP1 Val allele and GSTM1 present genotype.Conclusions: Children with high EPHX1 activity may have increase risk of asthma and wheezing outcomes, and can be mediated through airway oxidative stress generation.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: In 2009, an expert panel met to propose a WHO definition of asthma severity and control, and criteria for describing exacerbations and their severity, which would be globally applicable. This review addresses their findings in the context of recent literature, and assesses the usefulness of these definitions in children in particular.Recent Findings: Severe asthma was defined by the level of current clinical control and risks as: 'Uncontrolled asthma which can result in risk of frequent severe exacerbations (or death) and/or adverse reactions to medications and/or chronic morbidity (including impaired lung function or reduced lung growth in children)'. Severe asthma includes three groups, with different public health messages and challenges: untreated severe asthma, due to undiagnosed asthma or unavailability of therapy, difficult-to-treat severe asthma (due to adherence issues, inappropriate or incorrect use of medicines, environmental triggers or co-morbidity), and treatment-resistant severe asthma, including asthma for which control is not achieved despite the highest level of recommended treatment or asthma which is controlled only with the highest level of recommended treatment.Summary: These definitions will enable more precise measurement of the burden of severe childhood asthma globally. International collaborations in epidemiological and mechanistic studies, and randomized controlled trials of treatment, will be facilitated. However, both pathophysiology and severity are influenced by a number of factors with wide global variation; international comparisons should be interpreted with caution.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Indoor pollutants and allergens cause asthma symptoms and exacerbations and influence the risk of developing asthma. We review recent studies regarding the effects of the indoor environment on childhood asthma. RECENT FINDINGS: Exposure to some indoor allergens and second hand smoke are causally related to the development of asthma in children. Many recent studies have demonstrated an association between exposure to indoor pollutants and allergens and airways inflammation, asthma symptoms, and increased healthcare utilization among individuals with established asthma. Genetic polymorphisms conferring susceptibility to some indoor exposures have also been identified, and recent findings support the notion that environmental exposures may influence gene expression through epigenetic modification. Recent studies also support the efficacy of multifaceted environmental interventions in childhood asthma. SUMMARY: Studies have provided significant evidence of the association between many indoor pollutants and allergens and asthma morbidity, and have also demonstrated the efficacy of multifaceted indoor environmental interventions in childhood asthma. There is also a growing body of evidence suggesting that some indoor pollutants and allergens may increase the risk of developing asthma. Future studies should examine mechanisms whereby environmental exposures may influence asthma pathogenesis and expand the current knowledge of susceptibility factors for indoor exposures.

AB  - Various cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have suggested that synthetic bedding is associated with asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema while feather bedding seems to be protective. Synthetic bedding items have higher house dust mite allergen levels than feather bedding items. This is possibly the mechanism involved although fungal and bacterial proinflammatory compounds and volatile organic compounds may play a role. In this review we present and discuss the epidemiological evidence and suggest possible mechanisms. Primary intervention studies are required to show whether feather bedding is protective for the development of childhood asthma and allergic diseases while secondary intervention studies are required to potentially reduce symptoms and medication use in subjects with established disease.

AB  - Abstract: Obesity and asthma are significant public health problems, both with increasing prevalence in children. During 1980 to 1994 the prevalence of childhood obesity increased 100%, while the prevalence of self-reported asthma in children increased 75%. One common assumption is that weight gain occurs because many asthmatic patients avoid exercise since physical activity can trigger their symptoms; however, many contributing factors coexist. The intrinsic mechanism of obesity and asthma and their association is unclear. The purpose of this integrative review is to explore the link between obesity and childhood asthma, synthesizing its findings for clinical application.

School-based health clinics (SBHCs) reduced expensive ER visits and hospitalizations through better healthcare access and monitoring in select case studies. The purpose of this study was to examine the cost-benefit of SBHC programs in managing childhood asthma nationwide for reduction in medical costs of ER, hospital and outpatient physician care and savings in opportunity social costs of lowing absenteeism and work loss and of future earnings due to premature deaths. Eight public data sources were used to compare costs of delivering primary and preventive care for childhood asthma in the US via SBHC programs, including direct medical and indirect opportunity costs for children and their parents. The costs of nurse staffing for a nationwide SBHC program were estimated at $4.55 billion compared to the estimated medical savings of $1.69 billion, including ER, hospital, and outpatient care. In contrast, estimated total savings for opportunity costs of work loss and premature death were $23.13 billion. Medical savings alone would not offset the expense of implementing a SBHC program for prevention and monitoring childhood asthma. However, even modest estimates of reducing opportunity costs of parents' work loss would be far greater than the expense of this program. Although SBHC programs would not be expected to affect the increasing prevalence of childhood asthma, these programs would be designed to reduce the severity of asthma condition with ongoing monitoring, disease prevention and patient compliance.

AB  - Introduction Childhood asthma is a common condition and the prevalence has increased in many countries during the late 20th century. The Aberdeen schools asthma surveys reported rising lifetime prevalence of asthma between 1964 and 2004 in children aged 9-12 years, but a fall in wheeze in the last 3 years between 1999 and 2004. The present study tested the hypothesis that lifetime childhood asthma prevalence has fallen since 2004. Methods Children aged 9-12 years who attended the same schools surveyed since 1964 were invited to participate. A lifetime history of asthma or eczema and also wheeze in the past 3 years and 12 months was ascertained from a questionnaire. Trends over 1999, 2004 and 2009 were analysed with adjustment for age, gender and an index of deprivation. Results There were 2253 eligible children and 1196 (53%) questionnaires were returned. The lifetime prevalence of asthma rose from 24.3% in 1999 to 28.4% in 2004 but fell to 22.1% in 2009 (p<0.001), while wheeze in the last 3 years fell from 27.9% in 1999 to 25.2% in 2004 and fell further to 22.2% in 2009 (p<0.001). The lifetime prevalence of eczema among 9-12 year olds was 21.4% in 1999, 34.1% in 2004 and 30.7% in 2009 (p<0.001). Reductions in symptom prevalences between 2004 and 2009 were significant for girls but not boys. Conclusion The prevalence of lifetime asthma and wheeze appear to have fallen in school children, especially girls, although the low response rate means some caution is required when interpreting the results. Asthma prevalence remains high and the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood.

AB  - SYSTEM: Cambridge Health Alliance is an integrated health care system, heavily focused on public health and safety-net populations and based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It has 3 hospital campuses, 15 primary care practices, 20 specialty centers, and a statewide Medicaid managed care plan with 170,000 members. KEY INNOVATION: Partnering with the public health system and drawing on other community resources to improve patients' health and reduce their need for acute care. The alliance's Childhood Asthma Program has dramatically reduced hospitalizations and emergency department visits through optimal medication management for children. Teams of registered nurses and community health workers make home visits to help parents reduce or eliminate asthma triggers. The alliance is taking similar approaches to reducing obesity, managing diabetes, and improving complex care among the patients it serves. COST SAVINGS: The alliance says that the asthma program has shown a return on investment of about $4 for every $1 invested. QUALITY IMPROVEMENT RESULTS: For children in the asthma program, annual pediatric asthma-related admissions to alliance hospitals dropped 45 percent and annual pediatric asthma-related emergency department visits fell by 50 percent in the period 2002-09. In another program, Healthy Living Cambridge Kids, the prevalence of healthy weight increased by 2.4 percentage points (p < 0.05), a 5 percent change, and the prevalence of obesity decreased 2.2 percentage points (p < 0.05), a decline of 11 percent, among the cohort followed for three years. CHALLENGES: The alliance's approaches work in a capitated system, but in fee-for-service Medicaid, most of the community outreach services are not reimbursed. Furthermore, reducing use of services currently benefits payers but not providers.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the association between the clinical severity of childhood asthma and serum leptin levels, to define whether the severity of asthma correlates with body mass index (BMI) or serum leptin levels and to examine the sensitivity of leptin levels in predicting asthma severity.Methods: This study was conducted in 65 patients, aged 2 to 14 yrs with newly diagnosed asthma without any chronic co-morbidity. The subjects were distributed into three groups according to the severity of asthma.Results: Intra-group serum leptin levels before and after treatment did not show significant difference (p>0.05). Inter-group pre-treatment leptin levels were different significantly (p<0.01) and the difference originated from Group I and III as well as Group II and III. No correlation existed between leptin levels and BMI (p>0.05).Conclusions: Leptin levels correlated with the clinical severity of asthma and this was suggested to be associated with the severity of inflammation in asthma. More studies are required to evaluate leptin levels in predicting asthma severity.

AB  - Background: Children who grow up in environments that afford them a wide range of microbial exposures, such as traditional farms, are protected from childhood asthma and atopy. In previous studies, markers of microbial exposure have been inversely related to these conditions.Methods: In two cross-sectional studies, we compared children living on farms with those in a reference group with respect to the prevalence of asthma and atopy and to the diversity of microbial exposure. In one study--PARSIFAL (Prevention of Allergy-Risk Factors for Sensitization in Children Related to Farming and Anthroposophic Lifestyle)--samples of mattress dust were screened for bacterial DNA with the use of single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analyses to detect environmental bacteria that cannot be measured by means of culture techniques. In the other study--GABRIELA (Multidisciplinary Study to Identify the Genetic and Environmental Causes of Asthma in the European Community [GABRIEL] Advanced Study)--samples of settled dust from children's rooms were evaluated for bacterial and fungal taxa with the use of culture techniques.Results: In both studies, children who lived on farms had lower prevalences of asthma and atopy and were exposed to a greater variety of environmental microorganisms than the children in the reference group. In turn, diversity of microbial exposure was inversely related to the risk of asthma (odds ratio for PARSIFAL, 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44 to 0.89; odds ratio for GABRIELA, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.99). In addition, the presence of certain more circumscribed exposures was also inversely related to the risk of asthma; this included exposure to species in the fungal taxon eurotium (adjusted odds ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.76) and to a variety of bacterial species, including Listeria monocytogenes, bacillus species, corynebacterium species, and others (adjusted odds ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.86).Conclusions: Children living on farms were exposed to a wider range of microbes than were children in the reference group, and this exposure explains a substantial fraction of the inverse relation between asthma and growing up on a farm.

AB  - Rationale: Childhood asthma and obesity have reached epidemic proportions worldwide, and the latter is also contributing to increasing rates of related metabolic disorders, such as diabetes. Yet, the relationship between asthma, obesity, and abnormal lipid and glucose metabolism is not well understood, nor has it been adequately explored in children.Objectives: To analyze the relationship between asthma diagnosis and body mass in children across the entire range of weight percentile categories, and to test the hypothesis that early derangement in lipid and glucose metabolism is independently associated with increased risk for asthma.Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of a representative sample of public school children from a statewide community-based screening program, including a total of 17,994 children, 4 to 12 years old, living in predominantly rural West Virginia, and enrolled in kindergarten, second, or fifth grade classrooms.Measurements and Main Results: We analyzed demographics; family history; smoke exposure; parent-reported asthma diagnosis; body mass index; evidence of acanthosis nigricans as a marker for developing insulin resistance; and fasting serum lipid profile including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. Regardless of their body mass index percentile, children diagnosed with asthma were more likely than children without asthma to have higher triglyceride levels and acanthosis nigricans after controlling for sex differences and smoke exposure.Conclusions: This study provides the first set of community-based data linking asthma, body mass, and metabolic variables in children. In particular, these findings uniquely describe a statistically significant association between asthma and abnormal lipid and glucose metabolism beyond body mass index associations.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Asthma is largely a developmental disease in which the normal development of the respiratory and immune systems is altered by the impacts of environmental exposures acting on underlying genetic predispositions. This review will comment on the latest evidence in this field. RECENT FINDINGS: There is increasing evidence that several potentially overlapping genetic predispositions may contribute to the development of asthma, including predisposition to abnormal lung growth, resulting in lower lung function; delayed immune maturation; predisposition to lower respiratory viral infections; early allergic sensitization; and predisposition to bronchial hyper-responsiveness. Networks of genes and environmental modification of gene expression via epigenetic mechanisms are also likely to be important. Antenatal exposures that increase the risk of asthma include tobacco smoke, ambient and indoor air pollution. Impacts of maternal nutrition and maternal diseases, such as asthma and diabetes, are also important. Early life environmental exposures may also increase the risk of asthma via impacts on lung growth and immune maturation. Synergistic interactions between viral lower respiratory infections and allergic sensitization in early life appear to be especially important in increasing the risk of subsequent asthma. SUMMARY: The major risk factors for childhood asthma are a family history of asthma and allergies, early and persistent allergic sensitization to environmental allergens and viral lower respiratory illnesses in early life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Measurement of fungal and bacterial biomarkers can be costly, but it is not clear whether home characteristics can be used as a proxy of these markers, particularly if the purpose is to differentiate specific classes of biologic exposures that have similar sources but may have different effects on allergic disease risk. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated home characteristics as predictors of multiple microbial biomarkers, with a focus on common and unique determinants and with attention to the extent of their explanatory ability. METHODS: In 376 Boston-area homes enrolled in a cohort study of home exposures and childhood asthma, we assessed the relationship between home characteristics gathered by questionnaire and measured gram-negative bacteria (GNB) (endotoxin and C10:0, C12:0, and C14:0 3-hydroxy fatty acids), gram-positive bacteria (GPB) (N-acetyl muramic acid), and fungal biomarkers [ergosterol and (1→6) branched, (1→3) β-d glucans] in bed and family room dust. Results: Home characteristics related to dampness were significant predictors of all microbial exposures; water damage or visible mold/mildew in the home was associated with a 20]66% increase in GNB levels. Report of cleaning the bedroom at least once a week was associated with reduced GNB, GPB, and fungi. Presence of dogs or cats predicted increases in home bacteria or fungi. The proportion of variance in microbial biomarkers explained by home characteristics ranged from 4.2% to 19.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Despite their associations with multiple microbial flora, home characteristics only partially explain the variability in microbial biomarker levels and cannot substitute for specific microbial measurements in studies concerned with distinguishing effects of specific classes of microbes.

AB  - Background: The relationships between total serum IgE levels and gene expression patterns in peripheral blood CD4+ T cells (in all subjects and within each sex specifically) are not known.Methods: Peripheral blood CD4+ T cells from 223 participants from the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) with simultaneous measurement of IgE. Total RNA was isolated, and expression profiles were generated with Illumina HumanRef8 v2 BeadChip arrays. Modeling of the relationship between genome-wide gene transcript levels and IgE levels was performed in all subjects, and stratified by sex.Results: Among all subjects, significant evidence for association between gene transcript abundance and IgE was identified for a single gene, the interleukin 17 receptor B (IL17RB), explaining 12% of the variance (r2) in IgE measurement (p value = 7 × 10(-7), 9 × 10(-3) after adjustment for multiple testing). Sex stratified analyses revealed that the correlation between IL17RB and IgE was restricted to males only (r2 = 0.19, p value = 8 × 10(-8); test for sex-interaction p < 0.05). Significant correlation between gene transcript abundance and IgE level was not found in females. Additionally we demonstrated substantial sex-specific differences in IgE when considering multi-gene models, and in canonical pathway analyses of IgE level.Conclusions: Our results indicate that IL17RB may be the only gene expressed in CD4+ T cells whose transcript measurement is correlated with the variation in IgE level in asthmatics. These results provide further evidence sex may play a role in the genomic regulation of IgE.

AB  - Objective: We calculated the population attributable fraction (PAF) of Canadian childhood asthma due to modifiable environmental exposures, in order to estimate their relative contributions to asthma development based on the current literature.Methods: We conducted a systematic review to determine Canadian childhood asthma incidence, Canadian prevalence of exposure to airborne pollutants and indoor allergens, and international estimates of the risk of developing physician-diagnosed asthma (PDA) associated with each exposure. Combining risk estimates by meta-analysis where possible, PAF was calculated by the formula: PAF = Attributable risk *Exposure prevalence* 100%/Asthma incidence.Synthesis: Age-specific Canadian childhood asthma incidence ranged from 2.8%-6.9%. Canadian exposure prevalences were: PM10 16%, PM2.5 7.1%, NO2 25%, environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) 9.0%, cat 22%, dog 12%, mouse 17%, cockroach 9.8%, dust mite 30%, moisture 14% and mould 33%. Relative risk estimates of PDA were: PM10 1.64, PM2.5 1.44, NO2 1.29, ETS 1.40, mouse 1.23, cockroach 1.96, and spanned 1.00 for cat, dog, dust mites, moisture and mould. PAF estimates for incident asthma among preschool children were: PM10 11%, PM2.5 1.6%, NO2 4.0%, ETS 2.9%, mouse 6.5% and cockroach 13%.Conclusions: This systematic review suggests contributions to childhood asthma development from exposure to particulates, NO2, ETS, mouse and cockroach. The associations appeared to be more complex for cat, dog and dust mite allergens and more variable for mould and moisture. Additional prospective, population-based studies of childhood asthma development with objectively-measured exposures are needed to further quantify these associations.

AB  - Background: Although there are many instruments available to measure asthma knowledge in adult populations, a search of the literature identified the lack of valid and reliable instruments to assess the asthma knowledge of pre-adolescent children. The aim of this study was to develop and validate an asthma knowledge test for children 8-10 years of age. Methods: Three strategies were used to achieve the study objective: develop and design the asthma knowledge test; establish the content validity of test items; and conduct a pilot study to examine the validity, reliability and user friendliness of the instrument in a sample of 151 primary school children. Results: A 24-item asthma knowledge test was developed based on selected items from the Newcastle Asthma Knowledge Questionnaire and supplemented with items from other instruments. Test items were worded to ensure they could be understood by 8- to 10-year-old children, and content validity confirmed by an expert panel. A pilot study demonstrated that the test was user friendly, generated responses that reflected varying degrees of item difficulty and produced scores on the test that discriminated between 'known groups'. Conclusion: Findings from this study indicate that an asthma knowledge test designed for primary school-age children has considerable promise.With further refinement and testing, this test will provide a valid and reliable measure of asthma knowledge in children with and without asthma that can be used in a wide range of childhood asthma studies.

AB  - Childhood asthma is highly prevalent, affecting approximately nine million children in the United States. Negative effects of pediatric asthma are disproportionately experienced by ethnic minorities living in low-income, urban settings. Given the great diversity in families' ways of addressing children's asthma symptoms, sociocultural factors underlying asthma disparities must be examined. The current study investigated associations among parents' beliefs about conventional and holistic/alternative medications, parents' religious problem-solving strategies and childrens' risks for asthma treatment nonadherence. The sample included 66 parents of ethnically diverse children with asthma living in urban settings. Factor analysis of the Religious Problem Solving Questionnaire yielded two factors, self-directed (ie, solving problems independently of God) and God-involved problem solving. Parents' strong positive beliefs about conventional and alternative medications were associated with greater self-directed problem solving and with more risks for nonadherence. Higher levels of self-directed problem solving also were associated with more risks for nonadherence. Self-directed problem solving mediated the associations of conventional and alternative medication beliefs with risks for nonadherence. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed.

AB  - The public health impact of returning to school after vacations on children's asthma have not been well explored. In this study, we investigated the timing and magnitude of New York State asthma hospitalizations from 1991 to 2001. We used a generalized additive model to assess the risk associated with school return among children compared to adults and the elderly. Hospital admissions on the first day of school were compared to days following four school breaks. Exceedance admissions and both length and cost of hospital stay were estimated. A significant increase in hospital admissions for asthma (20% to 300%) was associated with school return after each break. The strongest associations were observed following summer vacation and for children age 5 to 11 years. Returning to school after vacations substantially increases the risk of hospital admissions for asthma in children, and this has considerable public health and economic impact.

AB  - Millions of children in the U.S. suffer from asthma. A disproportionately large number of those children are from low-income and racial minority families. With or without asthma, children from low-income families are at risk for delayed school readiness and less than optimal academic achievement trajectories. The aim of this article was to review the literature on educational interventions for young children with asthma and their families to determine if there was sufficient evidence to guide practice. In addition, a new theoretical model upon which to base new interventions is proposed. Literature was reviewed from Medline, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and the Cochrane Reviews databases. A limited number of randomized, controlled studies of educational interventions for children and their families was found, and only one study was specifically aimed at preschool-age children. Comparisons among studies are difficult because of varying methodologies, and findings are non-conclusive. In conclusion, comprehensive, multidisciplinary, multi-level interventions are needed to minimize the effects of childhood asthma, especially for children from low-income families. Large-scale, randomized, controlled studies are needed to provide empirical evidence for the efficacy of specific interventions for preschoolers prior to school entry to minimize the detrimental effects of uncontrolled asthma on school achievement.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the dose-response relationship (benefits and harms) of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) in children with persistent asthma. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared ≥2 doses of ICSs in children aged 3 to 18 years with persistent asthma. Medline was searched for articles published between 1950 and August 2009. Main outcomes of our analyses included morning and evening peak expiratory flow, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, asthma symptom score, β2-agonist use, withdrawal because of lack of efficacy, and adverse events. Meta-analyses were performed to compare moderate (300-400 μg/day) with low (≤200 μg/day beclomethasone-equivalent) doses of ICSs. RESULTS: Fourteen RCTs (5768 asthmatic children) that evaluated 5 ICSs were included. The pooled standardized mean difference from 6 trials revealed a small but statistically significant increase of moderate over low doses in improving forced expiratory volume in 1 second (standardized mean difference: 0.11 [95% confidence interval: 0.01-0.211) among children with mild-to-moderate asthma. There was no significant difference between 2 doses in terms of other efficacy outcomes. Local adverse events were uncommon, and there was no evidence of dose-response relationship at low-to-moderate doses. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with low doses, moderate doses of ICSs may not provide clinically relevant therapeutic advantage in children with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma. Additional RCTs are needed to clarify the dose-response relationship of ICSs in persistent childhood asthma.

AB  - Childhood asthma, the most common chronic childhood condition, is associated with high rates of asthma morbidity (emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and school days missed due to asthma). Inadequate asthma control accounts for $1.9 billion annual health expenditures. Numerous studies have identified the relationship of the family caregiver's perception regarding asthma management and the child's asthma outcomes; though few have examined family caregiver asthma management behaviors. Knafl and colleagues (2003) defined family management behaviors as accommodations that family members use to manage the condition on a daily basis. The primary aim of this study was to examine the relationship among family management behaviors, such as condition management ability and condition management effort; asthma morbidity; and asthma control from the perception of maternal caregivers.A total of 101 maternal caregivers of school-aged children diagnosed with persistent asthma were recruited from a specialty asthma clinic. Data were obtained through maternal caregiver self-report and included demographics, asthma morbidity, asthma control (Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), and family management behaviors (effort and ability subscales, Family Management Measure). Data were analyzed using correlations and regressions.Data analysis (N =101) indicated 94% of maternal caregivers are mothers, while the majority currently work outside the home (57%). Children were 53% male, had an average age of 8.9 (range 5-12) and 66% were minority. 54% of the children had poor control as determined by the ACQ (using score of >1.5 to indicate poor control) and 62% had greater than one emergency department visit or hospitalization during the past year. Effort positively correlated with asthma control (r = .426, p = .001) and school days missed (r = .259, p = .010) while ability negatively correlated with hospitalizations (r = - .206, p = .039). When controlling for minority, income, and work status, effort is predictive of school days missed (beta = .920, p = .020) and asthma control (beta = .253, p = .028) and ability is predictive of asthma control (beta = -.238, p = .037).Minority status, income, and work status correlated with emergency department visits, school days missed and asthma control; thus confirming what has been previously published in the literature. When caregivers perceived they were expending a lot of effort on their child's asthma management and were not confident in their ability to perform asthma management activities, the child's asthma outcomes were worse. This indicates the need to focus more interest on perceptions of maternal caregivers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthma in the pediatric population imposes a significant burden on the Australian health care system. The lack of a standardized asthma assessment tool is an area that needs to be addressed. OBJECTIVE: To validate the pulmonary index score (PIS) against the National Asthma Council Guidelines (NACG) asthma assessment. METHODS: The project was approved by The Children's Hospital at Westmead Human Research Ethics Committee. Sixty-five patients aged 1 to 12 years with acute asthma were assessed independently using both the PIS and the NACG on presentation to the emergency department. RESULTS: These results indicate that the PIS (1) has high internal consistency (Cronbach [alpha] = .835); (2) correlates well with the NACG, with significant differences in PIS values across different NACG severity categories; (3) predicts with good sensitivity (85% for nonmild cases and 88% for severe cases) and specificity (75% for nonmild cases and 77% for severe cases) the various categories of asthma severity according to the NACG; and (4) significantly differs between admitted (mean PIS = 8.4) and nonadmitted (mean PIS = 5.0) patients. CONCLUSION: Use of the PIS may provide an objective and standardized approach to the assessment and monitoring of asthma in children.

AB  - Background Despite the therapeutic efficacy of the anti-IgE monoclonal antibody, the role of IgE in allergic asthma is still a matter of debate. This may be mostly relevant in childhood, where a wide range of total serum (s) IgE levels is often detected. Aim To evaluate whether the relationships between total or allergen-specific sIgE levels and the clinical markers of allergic inflammation and the pulmonary function values might be affected by the demographic characteristics of the patients or by the presence of multiple sensitisations to allergens. Methods 64 asthmatic children sensitised to house dust mites (HDM) were evaluated. The role of age, sex and multiple sensitisations was evaluated by multiple regression model (MRM) analysis. Results Total and HDM-specific sIgE levels (Log) showed similar moderate-to-strong correlations with exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) and blood eosinophilia (Log) (p<0.0001) but not with forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)), %FEV(1) change after salbutamol. The positive associations between total sIgE levels and Log FENO levels or Log blood eosinophilia were also detected by MRM analysis. Age brought a negative, although limited, contribution to FENO levels and blood eosinophilia (p<0.043). Positive similar associations were also detected between HDM-specific sIgE levels and FENO levels or blood eosinophilia; however, no significant contribution of age or of other covariates was detected. Conclusion In childhood allergic asthma, total and HDM-specific sIgE levels are tightly linked to markers of allergic inflammation but not to pulmonary functions. These relationships are weakly affected by age but not by sex or by the presence of multiple sensitisations.

AB  - Background: Concerns about the achievement of children with asthma and respiratory conditions are especially important in New Zealand, which has one of the world's highest rates of childhood asthma. The present study evaluated whether entering school with asthma was associated with low achievement after the first year.Methods: A child cohort was recruited to a prospective study at time of first enrollment into randomly selected schools in Christchurch. Parent interviews covered demographics and respiratory status. Physician reports were sought for children with asthma, and all respiratory information was clinically reviewed. The children's achievement in reading and math was individually assessed at school entry and reassessed after 12 months. Schools reported absences. Intelligence subtests were administered.Results: Two hundred ninety-eight children were recruited, including 55 (18.5%) with current asthma. At 1-year follow-up, retention was 93.7%. Children who entered school with asthma were more likely to be ≥ 6 months behind other participants in reading words (P = .023) and books (P = .026), but not in math (P = .167) at the end of the first year of school. Achievement was not related to asthma severity. Entering school with asthma reliably predicted low reading achievement independent of other known covariates of low achievement (high absenteeism, minority status, male gender, single-parent family, poor academic skills at school entry, and low socioeconomic status).Conclusions: Entering school with asthma was a significant predictor of low achievement in reading at 12-month follow-up, independent of asthma severity, high absenteeism, or other covariates of low achievement.

AB  - Objective: To determine factors associated with 24-month change in quality of life in children with asthma and their parents during the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP).Methods: Participants from 4 CAMP clinical centers were administered the Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life questionnaire and protocol measures of asthma symptoms, lung function, and psychological measures.Results: Multivariate logistic regression analyses determined predictors of moderate change in quality of life. Subclinical levels of depression predicted moderate improvement in child-reported quality of life. Level of depressed affect together with clinical asthma features predicted moderate decline. Improvement in parent quality of life was predicted by perception of illness burden, whereas family features and a child missing school predicted moderate decline.Conclusions: This ancillary study provided an opportunity to examine the determinants of 24-month change in parent and child of quality of life within a subset of the CAMP participants. Moderate changes in quality of life occur in clinical studies and have both psychosocial correlates and illness characteristics.

AB  - Background: Asthma is a major public health problem that affects millions of children worldwide, and exacerbations account for most of its morbidity and costs. Primary-care providers lack efficient tools to identify children at high risk for exacerbations. We aimed to construct a clinical score to help providers to identify such children.Methods: Our main outcome was severe asthma exacerbation, which was defined as any hospitalization, urgent visit, or systemic steroid course for asthma in the previous year, in children. A clinical score, consisting of a checklist questionnaire made up of 17 yes-no questions regarding asthma symptoms, use of medications and health-care services, and history, was built and validated in a cross-sectional study of Costa Rican children with asthma. It was then evaluated using data from the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP), a longitudinal trial cohort of North American children.Results: Compared with children at average risk for an exacerbation in the Costa Rican validation set, the odds of an exacerbation among children in the low-risk (OR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1-0.4) and high-risk (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 1.5-19.2) score categories were significantly reduced and increased, respectively. In CAMP, the hazard ratios for an exacerbation after 1-year follow-up in the low-risk and high-risk groups were 0.6 (95% CI, 0.5-0.7) and 1.9 (95% CI, 1.4-2.4), respectively, with similar results at 2 years.Conclusions: The proposed Asthma Exacerbation Clinical Score is simple to use and effective at identifying children at high and low risk for asthma exacerbations. The tool can easily be used in primary-care settings.

AB  - There is increasing evidence that experiencing viral wheezing illnesses early in life, especially in conjunction with allergic sensitization, is an important risk factor for the onset of asthma. In this review, the potential advantages and disadvantages of using rodent models of virus-induced chronic airway dysfunction to investigate the mechanisms by which early-life viral respiratory tract infections could initiate a process leading to chronic airway dysfunction and the asthmatic phenotype are discussed. The potential usefulness of rodent models for elucidating the viral, host, environmental, and developmental factors that might influence these processes is emphasized. There is a need for the continued development of rodent models of early-life viral respiratory tract infections that include the development of chronic airway dysfunction, the capacity to add components of allergic sensitization and allergic airway inflammation, and the ability to address both immunologic and physiologic consequences. Investigation of these rodent models should complement the research from pediatric cohort studies and begin to bring us closer to understanding the role of viral respiratory tract infections in the inception of childhood asthma.

AB  - Viral respiratory illnesses associated with wheezing are extremely common during early life and remain a frequent cause of morbidity and hospitalization in young children. Although many children who wheeze with respiratory viruses during infancy outgrow the problem, most children with asthma and reductions in lung function at school age begin wheezing during the first several years of life. Whether symptomatic viral infections of the lower respiratory tract are causal in asthma development or simply identify predisposed children remains a controversial issue. Wheezing illnesses caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), particularly those severe enough to lead to hospitalization, have historically been associated with an increased risk of asthma at school age. However, with the development of molecular diagnostics, human rhinovirus (HRV) wheezing illnesses have been recognized more recently as a stronger predictor of school-age asthma than RSV. In this article, the authors review the impact of virus infections during early life, focusing primarily on RSV and HRV, and their potential roles in asthma inception.

AB  - Rationale: Chitinases are enzymes that cleave chitin, which is present in fungal cells. Two types of human chitinases, chitotriosidase and acidic mammalian chitinase, and the chitinase-like protein, YKL-40, seem to play an important role in asthma. We hypothesized that exposure to environmental fungi may modulate the effect of chitinases in individuals with asthma.Objectives: To explore whether interactions between high fungal exposure and common genetic variants in the two chitinases in humans, CHIT1 and CHIA, and the chitinase 3-like 1 gene, CHI3L1, are associated with severe asthma exacerbations and other asthma-related outcomes.Methods: Forty-eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CHIT1, CHIA, and CHI3L1 and one CHIT1 duplication were genotyped in 395 subjects and their parents as part of the Childhood Asthma Management Program. Household levels of mold (an index of fungal exposure) were determined on house dust samples. We conducted family-based association tests with gene-environment interactions. Our outcome was severe exacerbation, defined as emergency department visits and hospitalizations from asthma over a 4-year period, and our secondary outcomes included indices of lung function and allergy-related phenotypes.Measurements and Main Results: Of the 395 subjects who had mold levels at randomization, 24% (95 subjects) had levels that were greater than 25,000 units per gram of house dust (high mold exposure). High mold exposure significantly modified the relation between three SNPs in CHIT1 (rs2486953, rs4950936, and rs1417149) and severe exacerbations (P for interaction 0.0010 for rs2486953, 0.0008 for rs4950936, and 0.0005 for rs1417149). High mold exposure did not significantly modify the relationship between any of the other variants and outcomes.Conclusions: Environmental exposure to fungi, modifies the effect of CHIT1 SNPs on severe asthma exacerbations.

AB  - This study evaluated peripheral eosinophil and serum eosinophilic cationic protein (s-ECP) levels as markers of asthma control. A total of 38 children with asthma (16 controlled and 22 partially controlled) were compared with 16 age- and sex-matched healthy children. Total asthma cases had higher eosinophil counts and s-ECP levels than healthy children and partially controlled asthmatics had significantly higher levels of both markers than controlled asthmatics. Controlled asthma cases showed non-significant changes in both parameters versus healthy children. A negative correlation was noted between degree of asthma control and both eosinophil counts and s-ECP levels (r = -0.60 and -0.75 respectively). s-ECP as well as peripheral eosinophil count may be helpful in the assessment of asthma control.

AB  - Rationale: Stress-elicited disruption of immunity begins in utero.Objectives: Associations among prenatal maternal stress and cord blood mononuclear cell (CBMC) cytokine responses were prospectively examined in the Urban Environment and Childhood Asthma Study (n = 557 families).Methods: Prenatal maternal stress included financial hardship, difficult life circumstances, community violence, and neighborhood/block and housing conditions. Factor analysis produced latent variables representing three contexts: individual stressors and ecological-level strains (housing problems and neighborhood problems), which were combined to create a composite cumulative stress indicator. CBMCs were incubated with innate (lipopolysaccharide, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotides, peptidoglycan) and adaptive (tetanus, dust mite, cockroach) stimuli, respiratory syncytial virus, phytohemagglutinin, or medium alone. Cytokines were measured using multiplex ELISAs. Using linear regression, associations among increasing cumulative stress and cytokine responses were examined, adjusting for sociodemographic factors, parity, season of birth, maternal asthma and steroid use, and potential pathway variables (prenatal smoking, birth weight for gestational age).Measurements and Main Results: Mothers were primarily minorities (Black [71%], Latino [19%]) with an income less than $15,000 (69%). Mothers with the highest cumulative stress were older and more likely to have asthma and deliver lower birth weight infants. Higher prenatal stress was related to increased IL-8 production after microbial (CpG, PIC, peptidoglycan) stimuli and increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha to microbial stimuli (CpG, PIC). In the adaptive panel, higher stress was associated with increased IL-13 after dust mite stimulation and reduced phytohemagglutinin-induced IFN-gamma.Conclusions: Prenatal stress was associated with altered innate and adaptive immune responses in CBMCs. Stress-induced perinatal immunomodulation may impact the expression of allergic disease in these children.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Both physical environmental factors and chronic stress may independently increase susceptibility to asthma; however, little is known on how these different risks may interact. The authors examined the relationship between maternal intimate partner violence (IPV), housing quality and asthma among children in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (N=2013). METHODS: Maternal reports of IPV were obtained after the child's birth and at 12 and 36 months. At the 36-month assessment, interviewers rated indoor housing conditions, regarding housing deterioration (ie, peeling paint, holes in floor, broken windows) and housing disarray (ie, dark, cluttered, crowded or noisy house). At the same time, mothers reported on housing hardships (ie, moving repeatedly, and hardships in keeping house warm). Maternal-report of physician-diagnosed asthma by age 36 months which was active in the past year was the outcome. RESULTS: Asthma was diagnosed in 10% of the children. In an adjusted analysis, an increased odds of asthma was observed in children of mothers experiencing IPV chronically (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.5) and in children experiencing housing disarray (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.0) compared with those not exposed to these risks. In stratified analyses, a greater effect of IPV on asthma was noted among children living in disarrayed or deteriorated housing or among children whose mothers were experiencing housing hardship. CONCLUSIONS: IPV and housing disarray are associated with increased early childhood asthma. Exposure to cumulative or multiple stressors (ie, IPV and poor housing quality) may increase children's risk of developing asthma more than a single stressor.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: This article reviews current concepts regarding the clinical and scientific rationale for the combined use of glucocorticosteroids and beta-2-adrenoreceptor (beta2AR) agonists in the treatment of childhood asthma.Recent Findings: Several studies have demonstrated that inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and beta2AR agonists are the most effective medications for the management of asthma in children. Given substantial evidence of an increased clinical benefit when these agents are used together, new studies are being pursued to establish the efficacy and safety of this combinational therapy in infants and children. Ongoing research is also investigating the mechanisms of beta2AR and glucocorticosteroids signaling and their molecular interactions. This new knowledge will likely lead to novel therapeutic approaches to asthma control.Summary: There is increasing evidence demonstrating that the combination of long-acting beta2AR agonists and ICS may be more effective than high-dose ICS therapy alone in the management of children with uncontrolled asthma. In addition, the use of a single inhaler containing ICS and a quick-acting beta2AR agonist might be a convenient alternative to prevent and treat asthma exacerbations. Future investigations should be designed to more specifically evaluate the efficacy and safety of these therapies in the different asthmatic phenotypes of infants and children.

AB  - This paper explores the experiences of parents of asthmatic children in the period leading up to their child receiving a formal medical diagnosis. To what extent did the parents face difficulties in obtaining this diagnosis? How did they describe their encounters with the healthcare professionals? In particular, did parents portray themselves as passive and dominated or active and participating during the prediagnosis phase? In-depth interviews with individuals and participants in a focus group exposed the prediagnosis phase as a distinct and memorable phase of the disease, often recalled as a period of frustration and uncertainty. Results show that instead of accepting the authority of the professional, parents eventually acquire knowledge elsewhere about the diagnosis and the healthcare system, and act according to that knowledge. As a fundamental uncertainty appears involved in the diagnostic process, parents dealing with this uncertainty use a number of strategies to gain control of the process of alleviating their child's disease. The paper discusses the status of the information that the researcher obtained from parents. Lay narratives cannot be treated as simple reports of an external reality. As the parental role is rooted in normative conceptions about what constitutes 'responsible parenthood', information given to the observer may therefore be influenced by the informants' concern with their appearance as moral persons or adequate parents. Although a research strategy based on one-sided interviews has limitations, using parents as a source of information offers a rare glimpse into the realities of patient-physician encounters.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We assessed policy and system changes and health outcomes produced by the Allies Against Asthma program, a 5-year collaborative effort by 7 community coalitions to address childhood asthma. We also explored associations between community engagement and outcomes. METHODS: We interviewed a sample of 1477 parents of children with asthma in coalition target areas and comparison areas at baseline and 1 year to assess quality-of-life and symptom changes. An extensive tracking and documentation procedure and a survey of 284 participating individuals and organizations were used to ascertain policy and system changes and community engagement levels. RESULTS: A total of 89 policy and system changes were achieved, ranging from changes in interinstitutional and intrainstitutional practices to statewide legislation. Allies children experienced fewer daytime (P = .008) and nighttime (P = .004) asthma symptoms than comparison children. In addition, Allies parents felt less helpless, frightened, and angry (P = .01) about their child's asthma. Type of community engagement was associated with number of policy and system changes. CONCLUSIONS: Community coalitions can successfully achieve asthma policy and system changes and improve health outcomes. Increased core and ongoing community stakeholder participation rather than a higher overall number of participants was associated with more change.

AB  - Dental care is the most unmet health care need of children and adolescents who have chronic conditions and diseases. Because advances in therapy and medical technology have extended the lives of this population, it is very likely that these children will seek care in general dental practices. It is extremely important for dental practitioners to be knowledgeable about their patients' history and medical treatment to deliver care safely. This article reviews four chronic diseases of childhood (asthma, cystic fibrosis, cancer, and sickle cell disease) and discusses recommendations for oral and dental treatment.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the effect of ambient particulate matter on variation in childhood prevalence of asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema.Methods: Prevalences of asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema obtained in Phase One of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) were matched with city-level estimates of residential PM(10) obtained from a World Bank model. Associations were investigated using binomial regression adjusting for GNP per capita and for clustering within country. For countries with more than one centre, a two stage meta-analysis was carried out. The results were compared with a meta-analysis of published multi-centre studies.Results: Annual concentrations of PM(10) at city level were obtained for 105 ISAAC centres in 51 countries. After controlling for GNP per capita, there was a weak negative association between PM(10) and various outcomes. For severe wheeze in 13-14-year-olds, the OR for a 10 microg/m(3) increase in PM(10) was 0.92 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.00). In 24 countries with more than one centre, most summary estimates for within-country associations were weakly positive. For severe wheeze in 13-14-year-olds, the summary OR for a 10 microg/m(3) increase in PM(10) was 1.01 (0.92 to 1.10). This result was close to a summary OR of 0.99 (0.91 to 1.06) obtained from published multi-centre studies.Conclusions: Modelled estimates of particulate matter at city level are imprecise and incomplete estimates of personal exposure to ambient air pollutants. Nevertheless, our results together with those of previous multi-centre studies, suggest that urban background PM(10) has little or no association with the prevalence of childhood asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis or eczema either within or between countries.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: A 2001 study revealed that $3.6 billion could be saved if breastfeeding rates were increased to levels of the Healthy People objectives. It studied 3 diseases and totaled direct and indirect costs and cost of premature death. The 2001 study can be updated by using current breastfeeding rates and adding additional diseases analyzed in the 2007 breastfeeding report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. STUDY DESIGN: Using methods similar to those in the 2001 study, we computed current costs and compared them to the projected costs if 80% and 90% of US families could comply with the recommendation to exclusively breastfeed for 6 months. Excluding type 2 diabetes (because of insufficient data), we conducted a cost analysis for all pediatric diseases for which the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reported risk ratios that favored breastfeeding: necrotizing enterocolitis, otitis media, gastroenteritis, hospitalization for lower respiratory tract infections, atopic dermatitis, sudden infant death syndrome, childhood asthma, childhood leukemia, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and childhood obesity. We used 2005 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention breastfeeding rates and 2007 dollars. RESULTS: If 90% of US families could comply with medical recommendations to breastfeed exclusively for 6 months, the United States would save $13 billion per year and prevent an excess 911 deaths, nearly all of which would be in infants ($10.5 billion and 741 deaths at 80% compliance). CONCLUSIONS: Current US breastfeeding rates are suboptimal and result in significant excess costs and preventable infant deaths. Investment in strategies to promote longer breastfeeding duration and exclusivity may be cost-effective.

AB  - Background: Little attention has been given to exposure to crime as a possible socioenvironmental contributor to variability in urban childhood asthma prevalence.Objective: To determine the association of violent crime, property crime, and drug abuse violations with childhood asthma prevalence in Chicago.Methods: In 2003-2005, the Chicago Initiative to Raise Asthma Health Equity conducted an asthma screening survey of children in grades K to 8 attending Chicago public and Catholic schools. Crime data were obtained from the Chicago Police Department. In addition to simple regression analysis, multilevel logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the effect of criminal activity on neighborhood asthma variance.Results: Of the surveys returned, 45,371 (93%) were geocoded into 247 neighborhoods. Neighborhoods were divided into quartile groups by mean asthma prevalence (9%, 12%, 17%, and 22%). Criminal activity (annual incidence per 100,000 people) was significantly higher (P < .001) in neighborhoods with a high asthma prevalence, especially drug abuse violations, which increased more than 6-fold (461 vs 2,921), and violent crimes, which increased more than 3-fold (448 vs 1,566). After adjusting for community race/ethnicity, only violent crime continued to be significantly associated with the neighborhood asthma prevalence (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.55, P < .05). When considered alongside sociodemographic and individual characteristics, violence continued to contribute significantly (P < .05), explaining 15% of neighborhood variation in childhood asthma.Conclusions: Evidence suggests an association between violent crime and childhood asthma prevalence in Chicago. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms that underlie this association may lend insight into potential interventions to address urban asthma.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: To discuss the role of human rhinoviruses (HRVs) in early childhood wheezing illnesses and how HRVs contribute to the development of childhood asthma.Recent Findings: Advanced molecular diagnostics have identified HRVs as pathogens frequently causing wheezing illnesses in infants and young children. Wheezing during HRV infection in early life identifies children at particularly high-risk of asthma development. Plausible mechanisms by which HRV could cause airway damage, promote airway remodeling, and lead to asthma development have recently been identified.Summary: HRV is a significant source of morbidity in infants and young children. The present review identifies mechanisms by which HRV lower respiratory tract infection, particularly in a susceptible host, could promote the development of childhood asthma. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the link between HRV wheezing in early childhood and subsequent asthma development, with the critical goal of identifying novel therapeutic and prevention strategies for both early childhood wheezing and asthma.

AB  - Purpose of review: To present three clinically important developments related to the utilization of pulmonary function to objectively assess the asthmatic child. Recent findings: The new asthma guidelines (2007) have added the forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio to the FEV1 as spirometric criteria for classifying asthma. Although a better indicator of airway obstruction, it has not clearly been shown to correlate with clinical criteria. The normal cut point for the ratio used in the guidelines of 85% for children may be too high, and compared to the lower limits of normal of 80%, could result in unnecessary treatment in some children. The bronchodilator response (BDR) phenotype reflects airway lability and has been associated with biomarkers of inflammation and responsiveness to inhaled corticosteroids as well as predicting long-term outcomes. Several studies have shown improved spirometric techniques in preschoolers as well as defining normal values in this age group. Impulse oscillometry (IOS), which is less demanding than spirometry, has been shown to identify asthmatic preschoolers in some cases better than spirometry and possibly identifying obstruction in the peripheral airways. It may also be a more useful test than spirometry in evaluating long-term drug studies. Summary: In addition to the FEV1/FVC ratio to detect airway obstruction, the BDR phenotype would appear to give important additional information regarding airway lability and inflammation, and should be included as routine spirometry. IOS is a promising test to identify asthmatic preschoolers, but more studies are needed to determine exactly what it measures and what constitutes normal values.

A population-based probability sample of 2491 Puerto Rican children, aged between 5 and 13 years, and caregivers from the South Bronx and the U.S. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico participated in this study. The parent version of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-IV was used to assess children's internalizing disorders. Children's anxiety disorders, parental psychopathology, and acculturative stress were associated with childhood asthma, abdominal pain, and headaches. Children's depressive disorders, maternal acceptance, and family functioning were associated with abdominal pain and headaches. Parents of children living in Puerto Rico were more likely to report physical health problems in their children than in the Bronx. Children's internalizing disorders, parental psychopathology, and acculturative stress may be important areas to target among Puerto Rican children with physical health problems.

AB  - The Community Organizing Network for Environmental Health (CONEH), a project of Community Action Against Asthma, used a community health development approach to improve children's asthma-related health through increasing the community's capacity to reduce physical and social environmental triggers for asthma. Three community organizers were hired to work with community groups and residents in neighborhoods in Detroit on the priority areas of air quality, housing, and citizen involvement in the environmental project and policy decision-making. As part of the evaluation of the CONEH project, 20 one-on-one semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted between August and November 2005 involving steering committee members, staff members, and key community organization staff and/or community members. Using data from the evaluation of the CONEH project, this article identifies the dimensions of community capacity that were enhanced as part of a CBPR community health development approach to reducing physical and social environmental triggers associated with childhood asthma and the factors that facilitated or inhibited the enhancement of community capacity.

AB  - Objectives. Using data on 2868 children born in the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study, we examined the association between changes in family socioeconomic status and childhood asthma. Methods. We determined the likelihood (odds ratio) of a child having asthma at ages 6 and 14 years for 4 family-income trajectories (chronic low, increasing, decreasing, and never low) over the child's lifetime. The trajectories were created from longitudinal latent-class models. Results. We found a 2-fold increased risk of asthma at age 14 years among children who had lived in a low-income family since birth, especially for girls. Asthma was less likely to occur in children born to single parents; income rose over time in many of these families. Compared with children in chronic lowincome families, children in households with increasing incomes had a 60% lower risk of asthma. Single-point measures of low income were not found to be associated with asthma. Conclusions. Chronic exposure to a low-income environment from birth was associated with the development of persistent asthma. There was also a protective effect against asthma among those children whose families had moved out of poverty.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Genomic scan analyses have suggested that the chemokine receptor cluster (CCR2, CCR3, CCR5 <300 kb span) on the short arm of chromosome 3 may contribute to susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and to the expression of a number of inflammatory diseases. Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and a deletion in these chemokine receptors have also been found in case-control studies to be associated with susceptibility for asthma and related phenotypes. We extended these case-control studies by establishing whether these polymorphisms were in linkage and linkage disequilibrium with asthma and related phenotypes using linkage and haplotype analyses. METHODS: We genotyped 154 nuclear families identified through two child probands with physician-diagnosed asthma (453 unrelated individuals) including 303 unrelated parents and 150 unrelated children. Atopy was defined as a positive skin prick test (SPT 3 mm) to a panel of common inhaled allergens. RESULTS: From a panel of ten known SNPs, only three polymorphisms: -G190A in CCR2, -T51C in CCR3, and a 32 bp deletion in CCR5 were found to occur at clinically relevant frequencies. All 154 families were used for haplotype analysis but only 12 nuclear families were eligible for linkage analysis. Both analyses confirmed that the mutations were in linkage with asthma, but not with atopy. CONCLUSION: The chemokine receptor genes on 3p21.3 are significantly plausible candidate genes that can influence the expression of asthma. The previous association of the CCR532 deletion with protection from childhood asthma appears to be explained by linkage disequilibrium with the -G190A mutation in the CCR2 receptor gene.

AB  - Asthma is the most common chronic illness in childhood and represents a significant burden to health care and educational systems. Between one quarter and two thirds of childhood asthma cases persist into adulthood. Childhood asthma may be particularly difficult to diagnose because of the high prevalence of episodic wheezing and cough in childhood illnesses such as upper respiratory tract infections.National and worldwide guidelines for the management of asthma in children are continually being updated. These guidelines recommend first establishing a diagnosis and assessing the severity of disease, initating pharmacologic therapy based on symptoms and lung function, and adjusting doses and agents as required based on the level of asthma control. Inhaled corticosteroids are the cornerstone of long-term asthma management in children of all ages. Recent research efforts have focused on ways to improve inhalant drug delivery to the lungs and minimize oral and systemic bioavailability so as to improve the therapeutic benefit:risk ratio.

AB  - Objective: Despite multiple published studies regarding the association between formaldehyde exposure and childhood asthma, a consistent association has not been identified. Here we report the results of a systematic review of published literature in order to provide a more comprehensive picture of this relationship. Data sources: After a comprehensive literature search, we identified seven peer-reviewed studies providing quantitative results regarding the association between formaldehyde exposure and asthma in children. Studies were heterogeneous with respect to the definition of asthma (e.g., self-report, physician diagnosis). Most of the studies were cross-sectional. Data extraction: For each study, an odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for asthma were either abstracted from published results or calculated based on the data provided. Characteristics regarding the study design and population were also abstracted. Data synthesis: We used fixed- and random-effects models to calculate pooled ORs and 95% CIs; measures of heterogeneity were also calculated. A fixed-effects model produced an OR of 1.03 (95% CI, 1.02-1.04), and random effects model produced an OR of 1.17 (95% CI, 1.01-1.36), both reflecting an increase of 10 µg/m3 of formaldehyde. Both the Q and I2 statistics indicated a moderate amount of heterogeneity. Conclusions: Results indicate a significant positive association between formaldehyde exposure and childhood asthma. Given the largely cross-sectional nature of the studies underlying this metaanalysis, further well-designed prospective epidemiologic studies are needed.

AB  - The goal of this study was to assess the relationship between type and quality of housing and childhood asthma in an urban community with a wide gradient of racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and housing characteristics. A parent-report questionnaire was distributed in 26 randomly selected New York City public elementary schools. Type of housing was categorized using the participants' addresses and the Building Information System, a publicly-accessible database from the New York City Department of Buildings. Type of housing was associated with childhood asthma with the highest prevalence of asthma found in public housing (21.8%). Residents of all types of private housing had lower odds of asthma than children living in public housing. After adjusting for individual- and community-level demographic and economic factors, the relationship between housing type and childhood asthma persisted, with residents of private family homes having the lowest odds of current asthma when compared to residents of public housing (odds ratio: 0.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.22, 1.21). Factors associated with housing quality explain some of the clustering of asthma in public housing. For example, the majority (68.7%) of public housing residents reported the presence of cockroaches, compared to 21% of residents of private houses. Reported cockroaches, rats, and water leaks were also independently associated with current asthma. These findings suggest differential exposure and asthma risk by urban housing type. Interventions aimed at reducing these disparities should consider multiple aspects of the home environment, especially those that are not directly controlled by residents.

AB  - Rationale: Animal models demonstrate that aberrant gene expression in utero can result in abnormal pulmonary phenotypes.Objectives: We sought to identify genes that are differentially expressed during in utero airway development and test the hypothesis that variants in these genes influence lung function in patients with asthma.Methods: Stage 1 (Gene Expression): Differential gene expression analysis across the pseudoglandular (n = 27) and canalicular (n = 9) stages of human lung development was performed using regularized t tests with multiple comparison adjustments. Stage 2 (Genetic Association): Genetic association analyses of lung function (FEV(1), FVC, and FEV(1)/FVC) for variants in five differentially expressed genes were conducted in 403 parent-child trios from the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP). Associations were replicated in 583 parent-child trios from the Genetics of Asthma in Costa Rica study.Measurements and Main Results: Of the 1,776 differentially expressed genes between the pseudoglandular (gestational age: 7-16 wk) and the canalicular (gestational age: 17-26 wk) stages, we selected 5 genes in the Wnt pathway for association testing. Thirteen single nucleotide polymorphisms in three genes demonstrated association with lung function in CAMP (P < 0.05), and associations for two of these genes were replicated in the Costa Ricans: Wnt1-inducible signaling pathway protein 1 with FEV(1) (combined P = 0.0005) and FVC (combined P = 0.0004), and Wnt inhibitory factor 1 with FVC (combined P = 0.003) and FEV(1)/FVC (combined P = 0.003).Conclusions: Wnt signaling genes are associated with impaired lung function in two childhood asthma cohorts. Furthermore, gene expression profiling of human fetal lung development can be used to identify genes implicated in the pathogenesis of lung function impairment in individuals with asthma.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review focuses on recent findings in relation to potential functional consequences of structural changes in the asthmatic airway. RECENT FINDINGS: Increases in smooth muscle mass have been shown to be an early finding in childhood asthma, related to clinical severity and predictive of greater airflow obstruction. Both hyperplasia and hypertrophy contribute to the increase in smooth muscle mass. A phenotypic shift in the epithelium of asthmatic airways related to stress and injury is suggested by recent data, with likely direct transformation of epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells. Fibrocyte in-migration from the vasculature may be an additional source of increased smooth muscle mass. The increased smooth muscle may contribute to neovascularization via vascular endothelial growth factor. Computed tomography studies continue to show some correlations between wall thickness and airway physiology. Exacerbations are predictive of greater lung function decline and hence remodeling. SUMMARY: On balance, recent evidence continues to show that structural changes contribute to asthma persistence, airflow obstruction, lung function decline, and clinical severity, though there is increased recognition of the heterogeneity of asthma and in some phenotypes inflammatory cell influx or vascular effects may be more important than structural effects.

AB  - Background: There is increasing recognition of the importance of early environmental exposures in the development of childhood asthma. Outdoor air pollution is a recognized asthma trigger, but it is unclear whether exposure influences incident disease. We investigated the effect of exposure to ambient air pollution in utero and during the first year of life on risk of subsequent asthma diagnosis in a population-based nested case-control study. Methods: We assessed all children born in southwestern British Columbia in 1999 and 2000 (n = 37,401) for incidence of asthma diagnosis up to 3-4 years of age using outpatient and hospitalization records. Asthma cases were age- and sex-matched to five randomly chosen controls from the eligible cohort. We estimated each individual's exposure to ambient air pollution for the gestational period and first year of life using high-resolution pollution surfaces derived from regulatory monitoring data as well as land use regression models adjusted for temporal variation. We used logistic regression analyses to estimate effects of carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter = 10 [mu]m and = 2.5 [mu]m in aerodynamic diameter (PM10 and PM2.5), ozone, sulfur dioxide, black carbon, woodsmoke, and proximity to roads and point sources on asthma diagnosis. Results: A total of 3,482 children (9%) were classified as asthma cases. We observed a statistically significantly increased risk of asthma diagnosis with increased early life exposure to CO, NO, NO2, PM10, SO2, and black carbon and proximity to point sources. Traffic-related pollutants were associated with the highest risks: adjusted odds ratio = 1.08 (95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.12) for a 10-[mu]g/m(3) increase of NO, 1.12 (1.07-1.17) for a 10-[mu]g/m(3) increase in NO2, and 1.10 (1.06-1.13) for a 100-[mu]g/m(3) increase in CO. These data support the hypothesis that early childhood exposure to air pollutants plays a role in development of asthma.

AB  - The objective of this study was to estimate the association between ambient ozone levels and hospitalization for asthma/atopic dermatitis among children younger than 15 years old living in Seoul and Ulsan, Korea, in the years 2004-2005. Estimated relative risks of hospital admissions associated with an interquartile range (IQR) increase in ozone concentration were calculated using a generalized additive Poisson model. For childhood asthma, the effect of an ozone increase on the relative risks in Ulsan [1.21 (95% CI, 1.10-1.34)] was higher than that in Seoul [1.05 (95% CI, 0.99-1.11)]. The relative risks for childhood atopic dermatitis were also found to be higher in Ulsan [1.38 (95% CI, 0.80-2.36)] than in Seoul [1.28 (95% CI, 1.04-1.58)]. These results support previously reported findings and also indicate that ozone concentrations at levels below the standards in the Republic of Korea can be correlated with asthma hospital admissions in children.

AB  - This paper focused on the extent to which factors that are modifiable by health policies or provider recommendations influenced the level and changes in the burden of childhood asthma. Demographic factors, access to health care services, and asthma control activities were posited to potentially influence the level and changes in health burden of children with asthma. The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data from 1996-1999 on 3-11 year old U.S. children with asthma (N=784) were used. The findings of multilevel models of perceived burden indicated unfavorable trajectories among those families who had public health insurance. Asthma control activities were associated with favorable trajectories of both perceived and objectively measured burden. These findings emphasized the significance of asthma control and access to high quality and stable health care services as health policy targets.

AB  - Background: Daily controller medication use is recommended for children with persistent asthma to achieve asthma control.Objective: To examine patterns of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use and asthma control in an observational study of children and adolescents with mild-to-moderate asthma (the Childhood Asthma Management Program Continuation Study).Methods: We assessed patterns of ICS use during a 12-month period (consistent, intermittent, and none) and asthma control (well controlled vs poorly controlled). Multivariate logistic regression examined the association between pattern of ICS use and asthma control.Results: Of 914 patients enrolled, 425 were recommended to continue receiving ICS therapy in the Childhood Asthma Management Program Continuation Study. Of these patients, 46% reported consistent ICS use and 20% reported no ICS use during year 1. By year 4, consistent ICS use decreased to 20%, whereas no ICS use increased to 57%; poorly controlled asthma was reported in 18% of encounters. In multivariate models controlling for age, sex, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and asthma severity assessment, patients reporting consistent ICS use during a 12-month period were more likely to report poor asthma control (odds ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.1) compared with those reporting no ICS use.Conclusions: In this observational study of children and adolescents with mild-to-moderate asthma, most did not report continued use of ICS. Patients recommended to continue receiving ICS therapy and reporting consistent ICS use were less likely to report well-controlled asthma even after controlling for markers of asthma severity. Although residual confounding by severity cannot be ruled out, many children and adolescents may not achieve well-controlled asthma despite consistent use of ICS.

AB  - Background: Gene-environment interactions are likely to explain some of the heterogeneity in childhood asthma. Here, we describe the methodology and experiences in establishing a database for childhood asthma designed to study gene-environment interactions (PAGES--Paediatric Asthma Gene Environment Study).Methods: Children with asthma and under the care of a respiratory paediatrician are being recruited from 15 hospitals between 2008 and 2011. An asthma questionnaire is completed and returned by post. At a routine clinic visit saliva is collected for DNA extraction. Detailed phenotyping in a proportion of children includes spirometry, bronchodilator response (BDR), skin prick reactivity, exhaled nitric oxide and salivary cotinine. Dietary and quality of life questionnaires are completed. Data are entered onto a purpose-built database.Results: To date 1045 children have been invited to participate and data collected in 501 (48%). The mean age (SD) of participants is 8.6 (3.9) years, 57% male. DNA has been collected in 436 children. Spirometry has been obtained in 172 children, mean % predicted (SD) FEV1 97% (15) and median (IQR) BDR is 5% (2, 9). There were differences in age, socioeconomic status, severity and %FEV1 between the different centres (p≤0.024). Reasons for non-participation included parents not having time to take part, children not attending clinics and, in a small proportion, refusal to take part.Conclusions: It is feasible to establish a national database to study gene-environment interactions within an asthmatic paediatric population; there are barriers to participation and some different characteristics in individuals recruited from different centres. Recruitment to our study continues and is anticipated to extend current understanding of asthma heterogeneity.

AB  - Background: Prevention of childhood asthma is an important public health objective. This study evaluates the effectiveness of early detection of preschool children with asthma symptoms, followed by a counselling intervention at preventive child health centres. Early detection and counselling is expected to reduce the prevalence of asthma symptoms and improve health-related quality of life at age 6 years.Methods/design: This cluster randomised controlled trial was embedded within the Rotterdam population-based prospective cohort study Generation R in which 7893 children (born between April 2002 and January 2006) participated in the postnatal phase. Sixteen child health centres are involved, randomised into 8 intervention and 8 control centres. Since June 2005, an early detection tool has been applied at age 14, 24, 36 and 45 months at the intervention centres. Children who met the intervention criteria received counselling intervention (personal advice to parents to prevent smoke exposure of the child, and/or referral to the general practitioner or asthma nurse). The primary outcome was asthma diagnosis at age 6 years. Secondary outcomes included frequency and severity of asthma symptoms, health-related quality of life, fractional exhaled nitric oxide and airway resistance at age 6 years. Analysis was according to the intention-to-treat principle. Data collection will be completed end 2011.Discussion: This study among preschool children provides insight into the effectiveness of early detection of asthma symptoms followed by a counselling intervention at preventive child health centres.Trial Registration: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN15790308.

AB  - There are conflicting studies on T cell cytokine production in childhood asthma. In this study intracellular cytokine expression of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, IFN-¿, and TNF-¿ in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in children with atopic asthma were measured by flow cytometry. Results. A significant increase in the percentage of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells producing IL-4 and IL-13 and decrease in the percentage of CD4(+) producing IFN-¿ in asthmatic children was found. The percentage of CD4(+)/IL-13(+) was significantly higher in severe asthma than in children with intermittent disease symptoms. Severity of asthma was associated with increased both serum IgE and frequencies of CD4(+)/IL-13(+) T cells, as well as duration of disease. Moreover, a decrease in FEV(1), FEV(1)/FVC was observed in relation to the severity of asthma. Changes in cytokine profile in CD8(+) subpopulation didn't depend on the severity of the disease. Conclusions. Increased production of IL-4 and IL-13 in both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells accompanied by decreased IFN-¿ expression in CD4(+) T cells may be evidence that both lymphocyte subpopulations are implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma. Relationship of CD4(+)/IL-13(+) T cells with disease activity suggests that this lymphocyte subset may have a prominent role in childhood asthma.

AB  - One of the major challenges in health studies with a spatial dimension is to produce valid and meaningful geographical representations of risk. This issue has arisen in our research on childhood asthma and proximity to traffic in Perth, Western Australia. To illustrate the spatial variation in risk over the study area, we developed a method for constructing a 'risk field' map and applied this method to our study population. Cases and controls aged 0-19 years were defined using emergency department presentations from 2002 to 2006. For each asthma case, two matched controls were obtained. Geocoded residential addresses were used to calculate 'vectors' or arrows of risk across the study area. This allows a rapid interpretation, with the risk of asthma greatest in the direction of the head of the vector relative to the vector's tail. This approach clearly indicated that the risk of asthma presentation at hospital emergency departments is higher for children living closer to the major urban city centers. Application of our method to the study population suggests that the 'vector' approach may be useful as an exploratory tool for the spatial investigation of risk of other health outcomes.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and very low birth weight (VLBW) are associated with increased incidences of asthma and pulmonary dysfunction in childhood. However, no studies exist which examine asthma risk factors in children who were VLBW infants and did not have BPD. To address this issue, we assessed the asthma incidence and risk factors for asthma in 117 children (approximate mean age of 5 years) who were VLBW [<1500 g, mean gestational age (GA): 30 weeks] infants without BPD. The risk factors were both perinatal (such as steroid treatment, mechanical ventilation, surfactant treatment) and environmental (parental smoking, pet adoption, etc). The asthma incidence was 18.8%. Following multivariate analysis, it was determined that a family history of atopy was a strong risk factor for childhood asthma. Maternal antenatal steroid treatment was associated with a significantly reduced risk for asthma. GA and birth weight were not predictive of childhood asthma. These findings indicate that a history of familial atopy and antenatal steroid treatment are positively and negatively associated (independent of BPD) with childhood asthma in VLBW infants. The finding regarding antenatal steroid treatment warrants more extensive investigations.

AB  - About one in five Americans spends a considerable number of hours in school each week, and thus, is exposed to a variety of environmental agents. Community health nursing professionals require resources and specific training to acquire the environmental knowledge needed to raise personal and community awareness as an enhancement of their practice. Given limited resources for schools and local public health education initiatives, identifying and prioritizing environmental concerns comes before actions to prevent or reduce exposures. With the rise in prevalence of childhood asthma, of special concern are those agents within the school environment that may serve as asthma triggers. This pilot project, within a larger study in a large school district in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, developed and piloted an environmental health priorities survey with school nurses and other school staff about indoor and outdoor microenvironments relevant to school-aged children. Findings indicate that participants (N = 34) could prioritize environmental issues to inform future intervention activities (such as continuing education training), and distinguish predominantly indoor from typical outdoor exposure agents and their major sources.

AB  - Background: Viral bronchiolitis is the leading cause of hospitalization in young infants. It is associated with the development of childhood asthma and contributes to morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Currently no therapies effectively attenuate inflammation during the acute viral infection, or prevent the risk of post-viral asthma. We hypothesized that early treatment of a paramyxoviral bronchiolitis with azithromycin would attenuate acute and chronic airway inflammation.Methods: Mice were inoculated with parainfluenza type 1, Sendai Virus (SeV), and treated daily with PBS or azithromycin for 7 days post-inoculation. On day 8 and 21 we assessed airway inflammation in lung tissue, and quantified immune cells and inflammatory mediators in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).Results: Compared to treatment with PBS, azithromycin significantly attenuated post-viral weight loss. During the peak of acute inflammation (day 8), azithromycin decreased total leukocyte accumulation in the lung tissue and BAL, with the largest fold-reduction in BAL neutrophils. This decreased inflammation was independent of changes in viral load. Azithromycin significantly attenuated the concentration of BAL inflammatory mediators and enhanced resolution of chronic airway inflammation evident by decreased BAL inflammatory mediators on day 21.Conclusions: In this mouse model of paramyxoviral bronchiolitis, azithromycin attenuated acute and chronic airway inflammation. These findings demonstrate anti-inflammatory effects of azithromycin that are not related to anti-viral activity. Our findings support the rationale for future prospective randomized clinical trials that will evaluate the effects of macrolides on acute viral bronchiolitis and their long-term consequences.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effect of the timing, dose, and source of folate during pregnancy on childhood asthma by using data from an Australian prospective birth cohort study (n = 557) from 1998 to 2005. At 3.5 years and 5.5 years, 490 and 423 mothers and children participated in the study, respectively. Maternal folate intake from diet and supplements was assessed by food frequency questionnaire in early (<16 weeks) and late (30-34 weeks) pregnancy. The primary outcome was physician-diagnosed asthma, obtained by maternal-completed questionnaire. Asthma was reported in 11.6% of children at 3.5 years (n = 57) and in 11.8% of children at 5.5 years (n = 50). Folic acid taken in supplement form in late pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma at 3.5 years (relative risk (RR) = 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08, 1.43) and with persistent asthma (RR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.69). The effect sizes did not change with adjustment for potential confounders. The association was similar at 5.5 years but did not reach statistical significance (RR = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.96, 1.42) in univariable models. These findings on childhood asthma support previous observations that supplementation with folate in pregnancy leads to an allergic asthma phenotype in mice via epigenetic mechanisms and is associated with poorer respiratory outcomes in young children.

AB  - Bronchiolitis is the leading cause of hospitalization for children younger than 1 year of age and these hospitalized children have an increased risk for developing childhood asthma. It remains unclear, however, which children who have severe bronchiolitis (eg, an episode requiring hospitalization) will develop recurrent wheezing or asthma. Although many environmental and genetic factors may play a role in the pathway from bronchiolitis to asthma, this article focuses on the viruses that have been linked to bronchiolitis and how these viruses may predict or contribute to future wheezing and asthma. The article also discusses vitamin D as an emerging risk factor for respiratory infections and wheezing.Copyright © 2009 by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective: To examine whether early child care exposure influences the risk for development of asthma.Study Design: Longitudinal data from 939 children and their families from the National Institute of Child Health and Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development were analyzed. Exposure to other children in the primary child care setting as an infant (before 15 months) and as a toddler (16-36 months) were assessed as risk factors for persistent or late-onset asthma by age 15 via logistic regression.Results: The number of children in the child-care environment when the child was a toddler was significantly associated with odds of asthma, even after adjusting for respiratory illnesses and other risk factors (P < .05). The fewer the children exposed to as toddlers, the higher the probability of persistent or late-onset asthma by age 15.Conclusions: This study supports the theory of a protective effect of exposure to other children at an early age, especially as a toddler, on the risk of asthma. This effect appears to be independent of the number of reported respiratory tract illnesses, suggesting that other protective mechanisms related to the number of children in the child care environment may be involved.

AB  - The main objective of this study was to evaluate the correlation between the Environmental Relative Moldiness Index (ERMI) values in the Department of Housing and Urban Development American Healthy Homes Survey (AHHS) homes and an alternative analysis frequently used in mold investigations, i.e., the inspector's "walk-through" assessment of visual or olfactory evidence of mold combined with occupant's answers to a questionnaire about mold odors and moisture. Homes in the highest ERMI quartile were in agreement with visual inspection and/or occupant assessment 48% of the time but failed to detect the mold in 52% of the fourth quartile homes. In about 7% of lowest ERMI quartile homes, the inspection and occupant assessments overestimated the mold problem. The ERMI analysis of dust from homes may be useful in finding hidden mold problems. An additional objective was to compare the ERMI values in inner city east-Baltimore homes, where childhood asthma is common, to the AHHS randomly selected homes.

AB  - Asthma is the most common chronic illness of childhood and leading cause of pediatric hospitalization. Patient/ parent adherence rates to medications and home-management recommendations are low. The provision ofincentives for adherence to parents has had limited consideration. The objective of this study was to assess physician views regarding appropriateness and effectiveness of incentives for adherence in the management of childhood asthma. We performed a cross-sectional, web-based anonymous survey of Pennsylvania pediatricians and specialists caring for children with asthma. Three hundred and twenty-nine physicians responded, reflecting demographic characteristics of the state's physicians. Overall, 61% agreed incentives for adherence would be appropriate, 77% agreed they would be effective, and 50% agreed they would be both appropriate and effective. Among 287 respondents supporting incentives as appropriate and/or effective, 4 activities were endorsed by a majority for linkage to incentives: scheduled asthma checkups (85%), annual influenza shot (78%), refill of controller medicines (71%), and proven adherence to controllers with electronic monitoring devices (58%). Refund of co-payments was the most supported method to deliver incentives. A minority of all respondents agreed with statements that incentives would threaten patient/parent autonomy (15%), undercut social fairness (20%), or interfere with patient-doctor relationships (20%). Bivariate analysis did not reveal significant differences in reported attitudes by physician demographic or practice characteristics. Comments from respondents revealed a wide range of opinions about the role incentives in childhood asthma. Respondents were mostly open-minded to incentives for adherence in childhood asthma, though some respondents had concerns about the specific program design and implementation. These findings should be linked with surveys of other clinicians and parents in helping with a pilot to evaluate the real-world ability of incentives to improve adherence and outcomes in childhood asthma.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Because asthma disproportionately affects minorities, we evaluated the effects of parent mentors (PMs) on asthma outcomes in minority children. METHODS: This randomized, controlled trial allocated minority asthmatic children to the PM intervention or traditional asthma care. Intervention families were assigned PMs (experienced parents of asthmatic children who received specialized training). PMs met monthly with children and families at community sites, phoned parents monthly, and made home visits. Ten asthma outcomes and costs were monitored for 1 year. Outcomes were examined by using both intention-to-treat analyses and stratified analyses for high participants (attending >or=25% of community meetings and completing >or=50% of PM phone interactions). RESULTS: Patients were randomly assigned to PMs (n = 112) or the control group (n = 108). In intention-to-treat analyses, intervention but not control children experienced significantly reduced rapid-breathing episodes, asthma exacerbations, and emergency department (ED) visits. High participants (but not controls or low participants) experienced significantly reduced wheezing, asthma exacerbations, and ED visits and improved parental efficacy in knowing when breathing problems are controllable at home. Mean reductions in missed parental work days were greater for high participants than controls. The average monthly cost per patient for the PM program was $60.42, and net savings of $46.16 for high participants. CONCLUSIONS: For asthmatic minority children, PMs can reduce wheezing, asthma exacerbations, ED visits, and missed parental work days while improving parental self-efficacy. These outcomes are achieved at a reasonable cost and with net cost savings for high participants. PMs may be a promising, cost-effective means for reducing childhood asthma disparities.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: As part of a community-based participatory research effort, we estimated the preventable burden of childhood asthma associated with air pollution in the southern California communities of Long Beach and Riverside. METHODS: We calculated attributable fractions for 2 air pollution reduction scenarios to include assessment of the newly recognized health effects associated with residential proximity to major roads and impact from ship emissions. RESULTS: Approximately 1600 (9%) of all childhood asthma cases in Long Beach and 690 (6%) in Riverside were attributed to traffic proximity. Ship emissions accounted for 1400 (21%) bronchitis episodes and, in more modest proportions, health care visits for asthma. Considerably greater reductions in asthma morbidity could be obtained by reducing nitrogen dioxide and ozone concentrations to levels found in clean coastal communities. CONCLUSIONS: Both Long Beach and Riverside have heavy automobile traffic corridors as well as truck traffic and regional pollution originating in the Los Angeles-Long Beach port complex, the largest in the United States. Community-based quantitative risk analyses can improve our understanding of health problems and help promote public health in transportation planning.

AB  - Background: The prevalence of childhood asthma and childhood overweight has increased in the last 2 decades, disproportionately burdening ethnic minority children and those living in poverty with no clear understanding of underlying mechanisms.Objective: To explore the influence of demographic variables, childhood obesity (adjusted body mass index > or = 95th percentile), caregivers' smoking status, and caregiver psychosocial status on asthma severity and asthma control in an urban sample of children with persistent asthma.Methods: Child (with asthma)-caregiver dyads were recruited from public and archdiocese schools in Chicago, Illinois, as part of the Chicago Initiative to Raise Asthma Health Equity. Data were collected as part of the baseline face-to-face surveys conducted within the community.Results: The 531 dyads were divided into 2 groups: 294 taking controller medications were in the asthma control analyses and 237 taking rescue medications only were in the asthma severity analyses. In multivariate models, asthma control was significantly worse in obese children (odds ratio [OR], 1.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-3.05), African American children (OR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.05-4.46), and those with caregivers who had higher stress (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.01-1.18). Older children had better control (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69-0.90). Children with caregivers who wanted more asthma-specific social support were more likely to have moderate to severe asthma (OR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.06-4.05).Conclusion: In this community-based sample of children with active asthma, asthma control and asthma severity were associated with different factors. Caregiver variables were significant in both outcomes, and childhood obesity was associated only with poor asthma control.

This is an exploratory descriptive study developed with the use of questionnaires and interviews with mothers of asthmatic children from September 2008 to January 2009. After thematic analysis of data, three categories emerged: 1) The concept of asthma and its management in the eyes of caretaker mothers, 2) Asthma both as a suffering and a risk to children's lives, 3) Medicinal plants, simpathies and religiosity in the care of asthmatic children. The results have shown that it is important to respect the culture of caretaker mothers of children with asthma, so that their beliefs can be preserved, accommodated and restructured with professional care.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Studies have found associations between low birth weight and asthma. However, this association could be due to familial confounding. Our objective was to investigate whether fetal growth and birth weight affect the risk of asthma in childhood, controlling for gestational age (GA), and shared (familial) environment and genetic factors. PATIENT AND METHODS: Information on asthma, zygosity, birth characteristics, and potential confounders was collected for all 9- and 12-year-old twins through the Swedish Twin Register and Medical Birth Register. To obtain an overall effect of birth weight on risk of asthma, we performed cohort analyses on all twins (N = 10918). To address genetic and shared environmental confounding, we performed a co-twin control analysis by using the 157 monozygotic and 289 dizygotic same-sex twin pairs who were discordant for asthma. RESULTS: The overall rate of asthma ever was 13.7%. In the cohort analysis, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for asthma in relation to a 1000-g decrease in birth weight was 1.57 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.38-1.79), and for each reduced gestational week the OR was 1.10 (95% CI: 1.07-1.13). In the co-twin control analyses, a 1000-g decrease in birth weight corresponded to an OR of 1.25 (95% CI: 0.74-2.10) for dizygotic same-sex twins and 2.42 (95% CI: 1.00-5.88) for monozygotic twins. CONCLUSIONS: There is an association between fetal growth and childhood asthma that is independent of GA and shared (familial) environment and genetic factors, which indicates that fetal growth restriction affects lung development, supporting additional studies on the early metabolic and physiologic mechanisms of childhood asthma.

AB  - A primary goal of Healthy People 2010 is early detection and management of asthma in children to enhance their quality of life. The prevalence of asthma in children, as well as the rate of complications due to poorly managed disease, rose in the United States in the 1990s. However, since 1999, asthma prevalence seems to have reached a plateau, and disease-related hospitalizations and mortality have decreased. These changes have been ascribed, at least in part, to improved understanding of asthma management in children. To maintain and extend these improvements, nurse practitioners must be able to recognize early signs and symptoms of the disease and manage it appropriately and effectively. This article aims to give readers insight into the early diagnosis and management of asthma in children and to offer educational strategies for patients, family members, and the community.

AB  - Background: Amphiregulin, a member of the epidermal growth factor family, has been shown to promote the growth of fibroblasts, to be associated with the T-helper type 2 cell adaptive immune response, and to up-regulate mucin gene expression. We aimed to determine whether sputum amphiregulin is expressed at elevated levels in patients with asthma or eosinophilic bronchitis (EB), and whether it is associated with eosinophilic inflammation, pulmonary function, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness in children.Methods: A total of 117 children with asthma, 77 with EB, and 84 control subjects were enrolled in this study. Amphiregulin and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) levels were measured in sputum supernatants. We performed pulmonary function and methacholine challenge tests while measuring total eosinophil count, and serum levels of total IgE and ECP in all children.Results: The children with asthma had significantly higher levels of sputum amphiregulin (mean, 10.80 pg/mL; range, 4.07 to 38.75 pg/mL) than both the children with EB (mean, 5.76 pg/mL; range, 0.61 to 21.65 pg/mL; p = 0.013) and the control subjects (mean, 6.56 pg/mL; range, 0.51 to 17.98 pg/mL; p = 0.003). Sputum amphiregulin levels positively correlated with levels of sputum eosinophils (gamma = 0.221; p = 0.007) and sputum ECP (gamma = 0.601; p < 0.0001). Negative significant correlations were found between sputum amphiregulin and FEV(1) (gamma = -0.181; p = 0.006) or post-bronchodilator therapy FEV(1) (gamma = -0.233; p = 0.002). In children with asthma who were not receiving any controller medications, sputum amphiregulin level was negatively correlated with the provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV(1) (r = -0.398; p = 0.008).Conclusions: Our findings suggest that childhood asthma is associated with sputum amphiregulin, whereas EB is not, and that sputum amphiregulin would be a supportive marker of airway inflammation in asthma.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This comparative correlational study investigated families who use the emergency department for childhood asthma to identify determinants of follow-up care. The primary hypothesis was: families who obtain follow-up care differ in predisposing, enabling, and need characteristics from families who do not obtain follow-up care. METHOD: A convenience sample of 63 children presenting to the pediatric emergency department of a Central Florida hospital were enrolled. Logistic regression techniques were utilized to explicate the individual and combined effects of the variables that best predicted the outcome variable. The dichotomous dependent variable was follow-up care within 30 days of the ED visit. RESULTS: Sixty-seven percent of the children did not follow up as directed. Mother's level of education was significantly associated with no follow-up (P = .0282). Odds of no follow-up were higher for children with more severe asthma (odds ratio [OR] 12.44) or older mothers (OR 2.14). DISCUSSION: Follow-up is not occurring at desired levels. Although this study has clinical and research implications for health care providers, further research is needed to identify follow-up determinants and develop interventions to improve follow-up rates and asthma outcomes.

AB  - Introduction: Care management focuses on improving coordination of care and improving health-related behaviors for identified, at-risk populations. There have been relatively few studies of care management interventions that used randomized controlled clinical trial design. These studies have yielded discrepant results. Methods: Randomized controlled studies of asthma care management interventions were identified and summarized. Common themes of beneficial and nonbeneficial programs were identified. Results: The randomized clinical trials that did show benefit targeted low-income, inner-city patients with poorly controlled asthma and incorporated in-person plus telephone visits. Several programs provided services to reduce asthma triggers in the home; programs that did not show benefit targeted populations with relatively high levels of adherence to inhaled corticosteroid and did not provide resources (other than advice) for environmental remediation. One study that failed to show benefit had a fragmented, subcontracted care management process that was not connected to the child's medical home. Innovative programs that showed benefit in randomized studies and deserve replication include use of community health workers for home visits and school-based asthma care management. Conclusions: Asthma care management is beneficial in some, but not all populations. The most benefit was seen in populations with under-treated, poorly controlled asthma. Fragmented, subcontracted care management programs that were not community-based and not connected to the child's medical home were not beneficial. A care management process that involved both in-person visits and telephone follow-up and provision of resources for reduction of asthma triggers in the home were components of successful programs.

AB  - A recent review of student asthma rates and environmental audits of school buildings suggests that schools with poor indoor air quality have higher-than-average rates of asthma. Many Boston Public School (BPS) children and staff are learning and working in poor indoor environmental conditions that not only can exacerbate asthma, but also lead to other problems ranging from allergies and sinus infections to adverse academic performance [1]. The Boston Urban Asthma Coalition (BUAC) conducted a preliminary analysis of 2004-05 childhood asthma rates for BPS students and compared them to the 2004-05 environmental audits of the top 10 schools with environmental problems. This analysis suggests that schools with the highest rates of leaks, mold, and pest infestations also have higher-than-average asthma rates for children.

AB  - Little attention has been given to the relationship between fever and the severity of asthma. The authors studied 202 successive admissions of children with asthma over a period of 16 months to investigate the relationship between fever and the clinical course of asthma. There were 38 febrile children (18.8%), who were mostly younger than 5 years. Febrile children had a shorter mean hospital stay than afebrile children (1.7 vs 2.0 days). There were 25 episodes of acute severe asthma (13%): 2 among the 38 febrile children (5.2%), compared with 23 episodes among the remaining 164 afebrile children (14%). Three children, who had very severe asthma requiring transfer to an intensive care unit, were afebrile. Radiological abnormalities (collapse/consolidation) occurred in 13 cases: 3 from the febrile and 10 from the afebrile group. Monitoring body temperature is important in cases of asthma. Febrile children tend to be younger and are more likely to have a less severe clinical course of asthma.

AB  - Findings suggest that residential camps and group work within camps are highly valued by children and their parents. Children predominantly valued recreational and educational aspects of camp programming whereas parents emphasized appreciation for the safety that a condition-specific camp can offer a child with illness. Within the camp program, group work and peer support were integrally provided along with clinical monitoring and health teaching. A psychoeducational approach was implemented in which group participants engaged in sessions addressing self-care strategies and constructive ways to integrate childhood asthma in daily life. Participants identified the residential camp setting as a promising environment for group work among children and adolescents with asthma. Implications and recommendations are discussed.

AB  - Rationale: Association studies have implicated many genes in asthma pathogenesis, with replicated associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and asthma reported for more than 30 genes. Genome-wide genotyping enables simultaneous evaluation of most of this variation, and facilitates more comprehensive analysis of other common genetic variation around these candidate genes for association with asthma.Objectives: To use available genome-wide genotypic data to assess the reproducibility of previously reported associations with asthma and to evaluate the contribution of additional common genetic variation surrounding these loci to asthma susceptibility.Methods: Illumina Human Hap 550Kv3 BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA) SNP arrays were genotyped in 422 nuclear families participating in the Childhood Asthma Management Program. Genes with at least one SNP demonstrating prior association with asthma in two or more populations were tested for evidence of association with asthma, using family-based association testing.Measurements and Main Results: We identified 39 candidate genes from the literature, using prespecified criteria. Of the 160 SNPs previously genotyped in these 39 genes, 10 SNPs in 6 genes were significantly associated with asthma (including the first independent replication for asthma-associated integrin beta(3) [ITGB3]). Evaluation of 619 additional common variants included in the Illumina 550K array revealed additional evidence of asthma association for 15 genes, although none were significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons.Conclusions: We replicated asthma associations for a minority of candidate genes. Pooling genome-wide association study results from multiple studies will increase the power to appreciate marginal effects of genes and further clarify which candidates are true "asthma genes."

AB  - Children with asthma require multiple medications, and cost may be a barrier to care. The purpose of this study was to determine how often physicians ask about cost when prescribing new asthma medication and to identify factors influencing queries. We surveyed pediatricians and family physicians and asked whether they asked about cost when prescribing new asthma medication and if cost was a barrier to prescribing. One third of physicians (35%) reported that concern for cost to the family was a barrier to prescribing. Half reported not asking their patients about drug costs. Pediatricians were less likely to ask about cost (odds ratio [OR] = 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.20-0.92) when compared with family physicians. For every 10% increase in the number of privately insured patients, a physician was less likely to ask about cost (OR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.74-0.94). Communication about medication costs should be included in childhood asthma management.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the currently available data on the long-term outcome until young adulthood after early childhood wheezing. Asthma and lung function abnormalities were evaluated, with special attention to early-life risk factors. RECENT FINDINGS: In postbronchiolitis studies, 30-40% of the patients hospitalized for wheezing at less than 24 months of age have had asthma at 17-20 years of age. In the Tucson birth cohort study, the respective figure after wheezing at less than 36 months of age was 30% at 22 years of age. Relapses after many nonsymptomatic years have been common. In postbronchiolitis studies, lung function has been reduced in 31-36%, concerning also postbronchodilator measurements. Thus, the changes in airways seem to be structural, being present from infancy until adulthood, as found in the Tucson study. Parental asthma, repeated early-life wheezing and early passive smoking have been the most important early-life predictors of both adulthood asthma and lung function abnormalities. SUMMARY: Early childhood wheezing increases the risk for asthma and lung function abnormalities in young adulthood. Not only chronic childhood asthma continuing until adulthood but also asthma beginning in early adulthood seems to have its origin in early childhood.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: Vitamin D deficiency has been rediscovered as a public-health problem worldwide. It has been postulated that vitamin D deficiency may explain a portion of the asthma epidemic. The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for a role of vitamin D in asthma.Recent Findings: Both animal models and studies in human fetal tissues show that vitamin D plays a role in fetal lung growth and maturation. Epidemiologic studies have also suggested that higher prenatal vitamin D intakes have a protective role against wheezing illnesses in young children. Vitamin D may protect against wheezing illnesses through its role in upregulating antimicrobial proteins or through its multiple immune effects. In addition, vitamin D may play a therapeutic role in steroid resistant asthmatics, and lower vitamin D levels have recently been associated with higher risks for asthma exacerbations.Summary: Improving vitamin D status holds promise in primary prevention of asthma, in decreasing exacerbations of disease, and in treating steroid resistance. However, the appropriate level of circulating vitamin D for optimal immune functioning remains unclear. Because vitamin D deficiency is prevalent even in sun-replete areas, clinical trials are needed to definitively answer questions about the role of vitamin D in asthma.

AB  - Rationale: Maternal vitamin D intake during pregnancy has been inversely associated with asthma symptoms in early childhood. However, no study has examined the relationship between measured vitamin D levels and markers of asthma severity in childhood.Objectives: To determine the relationship between measured vitamin D levels and both markers of asthma severity and allergy in childhood.Methods: We examined the relation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (the major circulating form of vitamin D) and markers of allergy and asthma severity in a cross-sectional study of 616 Costa Rican children between the ages of 6 and 14 years. Linear, logistic, and negative binomial regressions were used for the univariate and multivariate analyses.Measurements and Main Results: Of the 616 children with asthma, 175 (28%) had insufficient levels of vitamin D (<30 ng/ml). In multivariate linear regression models, vitamin D levels were significantly and inversely associated with total IgE and eosinophil count. In multivariate logistic regression models, a log(10) unit increase in vitamin D levels was associated with reduced odds of any hospitalization in the previous year (odds ratio [OR], 0.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.004-0.71; P = 0.03), any use of antiinflammatory medications in the previous year (OR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.05-0.67; P = 0.01), and increased airway responsiveness (a < or =8.58-mumol provocative dose of methacholine producing a 20% fall in baseline FEV(1) [OR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.024-0.97; P = 0.05]).Conclusions: Our results suggest that vitamin D insufficiency is relatively frequent in an equatorial population of children with asthma. In these children, lower vitamin D levels are associated with increased markers of allergy and asthma severity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Risk of childhood asthma is increased in children with recurrent otitis media. This may be associated with recurrent respiratory tract infections in these children, but the role of adenoidectomy, a frequent operation during childhood, is unknown. Therefore, the role of adenoidectomy in the development of atopy and respiratory function changes characteristic of asthma was evaluated. DESIGN: Randomised controlled study. SETTING: Tertiary care centre. Patients: 166 children aged 12-48 months who had recurrent or persistent otitis media and who were followed-up for 3 years after randomisation. INTERVENTION: Randomisation to undergo insertion of tympanostomy tubes with or without adenoidectomy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was exercise-induced bronchoconstriction as evaluated by impulse oscillometry. The secondary outcome measures were bronchial inflammation as evaluated by exhaled nitric oxide and atopy as evaluated by skin prick tests. During the 3-year follow-up period otitis media episodes were documented in patient diaries. RESULTS: Adenoidectomy did not significantly influence baseline lung function, exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, exhaled nitric oxide concentration, the development of positive skin prick tests, or doctor-diagnosed asthma. Adenoidectomy did not significantly prevent otitis media. Recurrent otitis media (>or=4 episodes) during the first follow-up year was associated with an abnormal exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (OR 6.62, 95% CI 1.27 to 34) and an elevated exhaled nitric oxide concentration (OR 3.26, 95% CI 0.98 to 10.8) regardless of adenoidectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Adenoidectomy did not promote asthma or allergy. Recurrent respiratory tract infections during early childhood are associated with the risk of bronchial hyper-reactivity.

AB  - Objectives: To determine whether long-term, continuous use of inhaled anti-inflammatory medications affects asthma outcomes in children with mild to moderate asthma after use is discontinued.Study Design: Of the 1041 participants in the Childhood Asthma Management Program randomized clinical trial, 941 (90%) were followed to determine whether 4.3 years of twice-daily budesonide or nedocromil administration (each compared with placebo) affected subsequent asthma outcomes during a 4.8-year posttrial period in which treatment was managed by the participants' physicians.Results: The groups treated continuously during the trial with either budesonide or nedocromil did not differ from the group given placebo in terms of lung function, control of asthma, or psychological status at the end of 4.8 years of posttrial follow-up. However, the decreased mean height in the budesonide group relative to the placebo group at the end of the trial (1.1 cm; P = .005) remained statistically significant (0.9 cm; P = .01) after an additional 4.8 years and was more pronounced in girls (1.7 cm; P = .001) than in boys (0.3 cm; P = .49). Participants in all groups used inhaled corticosteroids during 30% of the posttrial period.Conclusions: Clinically meaningful improvements in the control of asthma and in airway responsiveness achieved during continuous treatment with inhaled corticosteroids do not persist after continuous treatment is discontinued.

AB  - Purpose: To examine how two groups (parents and healthcare providers) perceive asthma in Southeast (SE) Asian children in the United States, and to address issues of access to asthma care. Study Design and Methods: Using Kleinman's Explanatory Models (EM) approach, semistructured interviews were used with 12 families and 26 providers. Families were interviews in a clinic setting. Providers read a case example of as SE Asian child with asthma and were asked to anticipate the case family's EM of asthma. Data were analyzed using template analytic technique in which segments were clustered into etiology, causation, treatments, asthma impact, and access to asthma care. Results: Families predominately followed current asthma practice guidelines, whereas providers believed that SE Asian families primarily followed cultural practices. Families described the severity and impact of asthma as more intense than the providers described the same items. While families identified barriers to care as difficulty getting appointments and unavailable providers, providers viewed family barriers to be predominantly culturally based. Both groups noted the need for education and frequent healthcare visits as facilitators to care. Clinical Implications: This study suggests that important differences may exist between the way providers and SE Asian families perceive childhood asthma. Nurses are encouraged to ask the families in their care how they explain their children's asthma, thus facilitating more culturally competent care and increased ability to meet the family's needs. Implications for policy change relative to improving access to care to immigrant groups are also suggested.

AB  - Background: Studies of the relation between maternal diet in pregnancy and respiratory and atopic outcomes in the offspring have focused on the effects of individual nutrients and foods rather than dietary patterns. A study was undertaken to determine whether dietary patterns in pregnancy are related to childhood asthma and related outcomes.Methods: In a population-based birth cohort, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), dietary patterns in pregnancy previously identified using principal components analysis ("health conscious", "traditional", "processed", "vegetarian" and "confectionery") were related to early wheezing phenotypes and eczema; wheezing, hay fever, eczema, doctor-diagnosed asthma, atopy and total IgE at 7 years; lung function and bronchial responsiveness at 8-9 years. In regression models, confounders were controlled for using propensity scores.Results: Univariately, the "health conscious" pattern was positively associated with eczema, total IgE, forced expiratory volume in 1 s and forced expiratory flow and negatively associated with early wheezing and asthma (unadjusted odds ratios per standard deviation increase in pattern score for early persistent wheeze and asthma: 0.78 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.87), p = 7.3x10(-6), N = 8886 and 0.90 (95% CI 0.84 to 0.97), p = 0.007, N = 7625, respectively). The "processed" pattern was positively associated with early wheezing and negatively associated with atopy and forced vital capacity. On controlling for confounders, the effects were substantially attenuated and became non-significant (adjusted odds ratios for the associations of the "health conscious" pattern with early persistent wheeze and asthma: 1.00 (0.86 to 1.16), p = 0.99 and 0.95 (0.86 to 1.04), p = 0.27, respectively).Conclusions: In this cohort, dietary patterns in pregnancy did not predict asthma and related outcomes in the offspring after controlling for confounders.

AB  - Background: Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure is associated with poor asthma outcomes in children. However, little is known about natural changes in ETS exposure over time in children with asthma and how these changes may affect health-care utilization. This article documents the relationship between changes in ETS exposure and childhood asthma morbidity among children enrolled in a clinical trial of supervised asthma therapy.Methods: Data for this analysis come from a large randomized clinical trial of supervised asthma therapy in which 290 children with persistent asthma were randomized to receive either usual care or supervised asthma therapy. No smoking cessation counseling or ETS exposure education was provided to caregivers; however, children were given 20 min of asthma education, which incorporated discussion of the avoidance of asthma triggers, including ETS. Asthma morbidity and ETS exposure data were collected from caregivers via telephone interviews at baseline and at the 1-year follow-up.Results: At baseline, 28% of caregivers reported ETS exposure in the home and 19% reported exposure outside of the primary household only. Among children whose ETS exposure decreased from baseline, fewer hospitalizations (p = 0.034) and emergency department (ED) visits (p < or = 0.001) were reported in the 12 months prior to the second interview compared to the 12 months prior to the first interview. Additionally, these children were 48% less likely (p = 0.042) to experience an episode of poor asthma control (EPAC).Conclusions: This is the first study to demonstrate an association between ETS exposure reduction and fewer EPACs, respiratory-related ED visits, and hospitalizations. These findings emphasize the importance of ETS exposure reduction as a mechanism to improve asthma control and morbidity. Potential policy implications include supporting ETS reductions and smoking cessation interventions for parents and caregivers of children with asthma. Research to identify the most cost-effective strategy is warranted.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: Current levels of air pollution are consistently associated with asthma development and morbidity among children, suggesting that current regulatory policies may be insufficient. This review will describe recent studies that have examined specific emission sources or components of pollutants that may be associated with pediatric asthma and identify subpopulations that may be particularly susceptible to the effects of air pollution exposure.Recent Findings: Important advances include new characterizations of the effects of traffic-related air pollution in urban areas. They also include the application of novel exposure and outcome measures such as pollution estimates derived from land use regression modeling and biological markers of airway inflammation. Additionally, studies have identified host susceptibility characteristics that may modify responses to air pollution exposure, including polymorphisms in oxidative stress genes and epigenetic alterations.Summary: Identifying specific sources and toxic constituents of air pollution and accurately assessing air pollutant-related asthma outcomes are needed to better direct control strategies. Further research is needed to identify additional host factors that confer increased susceptibility to air pollution exposure. Future therapy to reduce the adverse effects of air pollution on respiratory disease will likely depend on targeting susceptible populations for intervention.

AB  - Objectives: Recent studies have explored the potential for swimming pool disinfection by-products (DBPs), which are respiratory irritants, to cause asthma in young children. Here we describe the state of the science on methods for understanding children's exposure to DBPs and biologics at swimming pools and associations with new-onset childhood asthma and recommend a research agenda to improve our understanding of this issue. Data sources: A workshop was held in Leuven, Belgium, 21-23 August 2007, to evaluate the literature and to develop a research agenda to better understand children's exposures in the swimming pool environment and their potential associations with new-onset asthma. Participants, including clinicians, epidemiologists, exposure scientists, pool operations experts, and chemists, reviewed the literature, prepared background summaries, and held extensive discussions on the relevant published studies, knowledge of asthma characterization and exposures at swimming pools, and epidemiologic study designs. Synthesis: Childhood swimming and new-onset childhood asthma have clear implications for public health. If attendance at indoor pools increases risk of childhood asthma, then concerns are warranted and action is necessary. If there is no such relationship, these concerns could unnecessarily deter children from indoor swimming and/or compromise water disinfection. Conclusions: Current evidence of an association between childhood swimming and new-onset asthma is suggestive but not conclusive. Important data gaps need to be filled, particularly in exposure assessment and characterization of asthma in the very young. Participants recommended that additional evaluations using a multidisciplinary approach are needed to determine whether a clear association exists.

AB  - Asthma, the most common chronic disease in children, is characterized by chronic inflammation of the respiratory system. If left uncontrolled, persistent asthma can have serious negative clinical outcomes. Thus, the earliest possible diagnosis based on the recognition of specific clinical indicators, treatment with anti-inflammatory controller medications such as an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) or a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA), and patient-centered strategies for monitoring disease and improving patient adherence are essential to successful asthma care. Recent clinical studies support the efficacy of ICSs over LTRAs as daily treatment for pediatric asthma. Routine follow-up and patient education can facilitate adherence to daily controller therapy and successful asthma control in children.

AB  - Background: Many studies have found that the risk of childhood asthma varies by month of birth, but few have examined ambient aeroallergens as an explanatory factor. A study was undertaken to examine whether birth during seasons of elevated ambient fungal spore or pollen concentrations is associated with risk of early wheezing or blood levels of Th1 and Th2 type cells at 24 months of age.Methods: 514 children were enrolled before birth and followed to 24 months of age. Early wheezing was determined from medical records, and Th1 and Th2 type cells were measured in peripheral blood using flow cytometry. Ambient aeroallergen concentrations were measured throughout the study period and discrete seasons of high spore and pollen concentrations were defined.Results: A seasonal pattern was observed, with birth in autumn to winter (the spore season) associated with increased odds of early wheezing (adjusted odds ratio 3.1; 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 7.4). Increasing mean daily concentrations of basidiospores and ascospores in the first 3 months of life were associated with increased odds of wheeze, as were increasing mean daily concentrations of total and specific pollen types. Levels of Th1 cells at age 24 months were positively associated with mean spore concentrations and negatively associated with mean pollen concentrations in the first 3 months of life.Conclusions: Children with higher exposure to spores and pollen in the first 3 months of life are at increased risk of early wheezing. This association is independent of other seasonal factors including ambient levels of particulate matter of aerodynamic diameter <or=2.5 microm and lower respiratory infections.

AB  - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data were used to describe 1980DS2007 trends among children 0 to 17 years of age and recent patterns according to gender, race, and age. Asthma period prevalence increased by 4.6% per year from 1980 to 1996. New measures introduced in 1997 show a plateau at historically high levels; 9.1% of US children (6.7 million) currently had asthma in 2007. Ambulatory care visit rates fluctuated during the 1990s, whereas emergency department visits and hospitalization rates decreased slightly. Asthma-related death rates increased through the middle 1990s but decreased after 1999. Recent data showed higher prevalence among older children (11DS17 years), but the highest rates of asthma-related health care use were among the youngest children (0DS4 years). After controlling for racial differences in prevalence, disparities in adverse outcomes remained; among children with asthma, non-Hispanic black children had greater risks for emergency department visits and death, compared with non-Hispanic white children. For hospitalizations, for which Hispanic ethnicity data were not available, black children had greater risk than white children. However, nonemergency ambulatory care use was lower for non-Hispanic black children. Although the large increases in childhood asthma prevalence have abated, the burden remains large. Potentially avoidable adverse outcomes and racial disparities continue to present challenges. These findings suggest the need for sustained asthma prevention and control efforts for children.

AB  - Acute episodes of airway obstruction followed by periods of apparent wellness are the main clinical manifestations of the disease for many children with persistent asthma. Although currently available asthma controllers decrease the risk for acute asthma exacerbations, 30% of children taking these medicines still have >/= 1 episode requiring oral corticosteroid treatment per year. There is increasing evidence that neutrophilic inflammation, against which inhaled corticosteroids are not very effective, plays a major role in the pathogenesis of asthma exacerbations. New therapeutic approaches are needed for this frequent cause of consultation in pediatric practice. One approach could be the development of drugs that target neutrophilic inflammation specifically. Studies in adults have shown that use of inhaled corticosteroids every time a bronchodilator is needed may decrease the frequency of asthma exacerbations. This strategy is currently being tested in a large clinical trial involving children with mild persistent asthma.

AB  - Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood in the United States, affecting nearly 6.5 million children. The prevalence and severity of childhood asthma have continued to increase over the past 2 decades, despite major advances in the recognition and treatment of this condition. Representing a heterogeneous collection of airway diseases, asthma has multiple pathologic processes resulting from the interactions of genetic susceptibility and environmental exposures. Preventing and treating airway disease in children will require new research approaches to understanding these complex interactions.

AB  - Although asthma has emerged as a major contributor to disease and disability among US children, the burden of this disease is unevenly distributed within the population. This article provides a brief overview of social-status variables that predict variations in asthma risks and social exposures, such as stress and violence, that are emerging as important risk factors. The central focus of the article is on the distal social variables that have given rise to unhealthy residential environments in which the risk factors for asthma and other diseases are clustered. Effective initiatives for the prevention and treatment of childhood asthma need to address these nonmedical determinants of the prevalence of asthma.

AB  - In this article we discuss studies of individualized and community-based interventions for control of asthma in children. We posit that successful programs share 8 common characteristics: (1) recognition of the multiple factors affecting childhood asthma; (2) careful assessment of participants' risk factors and needs; (3) tailoring of program elements to address participants' risk factors and needs; (4) consideration of both physical and social environments; (5) use of sound learning and change theories; (6) family involvement; (7) focus on children with the most serious disease; and (8) selection of delivery venues at which learning can be optimized. Challenges for moving practice and research forward also are presented.

AB  - We conducted a review of 164 relevant publications to consolidate the evidence on gaps in the quality of asthma care, the impact of those gaps, and the costs and benefits of closing those gaps. Researchers used a wide variety of definitions for measures of quality asthma care, clinical and utilization end points, and disease severity. Gaps in care were most evident for pharmacologic treatment, particularly the underuse of inhaled corticosteroids, with median usage rates of 40%; however, in studies with large proportions of black subjects, the inhaled corticosteroid usage rate was only 32%, compared with 51% for nonminority populations. Studies on outcomes focused on emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and missed school days. Because only 6 studies included information on the costs of improving asthma care, no consensus estimates of the cost/benefit ratio for better asthma care could be derived. There was insufficient evidence in the literature for assessment of the impact of gaps in care and the costs of closing those gaps. More economic evaluations of the impact of gaps in asthma care and of interventions to improve asthma control are needed. Future research on gaps in asthma care and their impact must use standardized definitions for key variables such as disease severity and care utilization to allow comparisons across studies and building of an evidence base that is convincing for policy makers and purchasers of care.

AB  - Rationale: Polymorphisms in the gene for transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFB1) have been associated with asthma, but not with airway responsiveness or disease exacerbations in subjects with asthma.Objectives: To test for association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TGFB1 and markers of asthma severity in childhood.Methods: We tested for the association between nine SNPs in TGFB1 and indicators of asthma severity (lung function, airway responsiveness, and disease exacerbations) in two cohorts: 416 Costa Rican parent-child trios and 465 families of non-Hispanic white children in the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP). We also tested for the interaction between these polymorphisms and exposure to dust mite allergen on asthma severity.Measurements and Main Results: The A allele of promoter SNP rs2241712 was associated with increased airway responsiveness in Costa Rica (P = 0.0006) and CAMP (P = 0.005), and the C allele of an SNP in the promoter region (rs1800469) was associated with increased airway responsiveness in both cohorts (P <or= 0.01). Dust mite exposure modified the effect of the C allele of exonic SNP rs1800471 on airway responsiveness (P = 0.03 for interactions in both cohorts). The T allele of a coding SNP (rs1982073) was associated with a reduced risk of asthma exacerbations in Costa Rica (P = 0.009) and CAMP (P = 0.005). Dust mite exposure also significantly modified the effect of the A allele of the promoter SNP rs2241712 on asthma exacerbations in both cohorts.Conclusions: SNPs in TGFB1 are associated with airway responsiveness and disease exacerbations in children with asthma. Moreover, dust mite exposure may modify the effect of TGFB1 SNPs on airway responsiveness and asthma exacerbations.

AB  - We examined associations between outdoor air pollution and childhood asthma, using measures of SES, neighborhood quality, and social support from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (LA FANS). We linked residential census tracts for 3114 children to government air monitoring stations and estimated average pollutant concentrations for the year before interview. CO and NO(2) levels increased and O(3) levels decreased as neighborhood quality decreased, yet correlations were low. Pollutant levels were not correlated with neighborhood support. Even after adjustment for social environment characteristics, LA FANS children living in high O(3), PM(10), and CO areas appeared to have worse asthma morbidity.

AB  - While Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is known to complicate asthma in adults, its association with childhood asthma is very rare. We present two patients, a four-and half year old boy who presented with severe asthma and a 12 year-old girl whose previous chest radiographs revealed fleeting opacities. Both were diagnosed to be suffering from ABPA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple issues play a role in the effective control of childhood asthma. OBJECTIVE: To identify factors related to the level of asthma control in children receiving asthma care from community pediatricians. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data for 362 children participating in an intervention study to reduce asthma morbidity were collected by a telephone-administered questionnaire. Level of asthma control (well controlled, partially controlled, or poorly controlled) was derived from measures of recent impairment (symptoms, activity limitations, albuterol use) and the number of exacerbations in a 12-month period. Data also included demographic characteristics, asthma-related quality of life, pediatric management practices, and medication usage. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to identify factors associated with poor asthma control and to explore the relationship between control and use of daily controller medications. RESULTS: Asthma was well controlled for 24% of children, partially controlled for 20%, and poorly controlled for 56%. Medicaid insurance, the presence of another family member with asthma, and maternal employment outside the home were significant univariable factors associated with poor asthma control. Medicaid insurance had an independent association with poor control. Seventy-six percent of children were reported by parents as receiving a daily controller medication. Comparison of guideline recommended controller medication with current level of asthma control indicated that a higher step level of medication would have been appropriate for 74% of these children. Significantly lower overall quality-of-life scores were observed in both parents and children with poor control. CONCLUSIONS: Despite substantial use of daily controller medication, children with asthma continue to experience poorly controlled asthma and reduced quality of life. Although Medicaid insurance and aspects of family structure are significant factors associated with poorly controlled asthma, attention to medication use and quality-of-life indicators may further reduce morbidity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In industrialized countries vaccination coverage remains suboptimal, partly because of perception of an increased risk of asthma. Epidemiologic studies of the association between childhood vaccinations and asthma have provided conflicting results, possibly for methodologic reasons such as unreliable vaccination data, biased reporting, and reverse causation. A recent review stressed the need for additional, adequately controlled large-scale studies. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to determine if routine childhood vaccination against pertussis was associated with subsequent development of childhood wheezing disorders and asthma in a large population-based cohort study. METHODS: In 6811 children from the general population born between 1993 and 1997 in Leicestershire, United Kingdom, respiratory symptom data from repeated questionnaire surveys up to 2003 were linked to independently collected vaccination data from the National Health Service database. We compared incident wheeze and asthma between children of different vaccination status (complete, partial, and no vaccination against pertussis) by computing hazard ratios. Analyses were based on 6048 children, 23 201 person-years of follow-up, and 2426 cases of new-onset wheeze. RESULTS: There was no evidence for an increased risk of wheeze or asthma in children vaccinated against pertussis compared with nonvaccinated children. Adjusted hazard ratios comparing fully and partially vaccinated with nonvaccinated children were close to one for both incident wheeze and asthma. CONCLUSION: This study provides no evidence of an association between vaccination against pertussis in infancy and an increased risk of later wheeze or asthma and does not support claims that vaccination against pertussis might significantly increase the risk of childhood asthma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic exposure in early childhood is a possible contributor to the increasing asthma prevalence in industrialized countries. Although a number of published studies have tested this hypothesis, the results have been conflicting. OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between antibiotic exposure before 1 year of age and development of childhood asthma. METHODS: Using administrative data, birth cohorts from 1997 to 2003 were evaluated (N = 251817). Antibiotic exposure was determined for the first year of life. After the first 24 months of life, the incidence of asthma was determined in both those exposed and not exposed to antibiotics in the first 12 months of life. Cox proportional hazards models were used to adjust for potential confounders and determine the hazard ratios associated with antibiotic exposure for the development of asthma. RESULTS: Antibiotic exposure in the first year of life was associated with a small risk of developing asthma in early childhood after adjusting for gender, socioeconomic status at birth, urban or rural address at birth, birth weight, gestational age, delivery method, frequency of physician visits, hospital visit involving surgery, visits to an allergist, respirologist, or immunologist, congenital anomalies, and presence of otitis media, acute, or chronic bronchitis, and upper and lower respiratory tract infections during the first year of life. As the number of courses of antibiotics increased, this was associated with increased asthma risk, with the highest risk being in children who received >4 courses. All antibiotics were associated with an increased risk of developing asthma, with the exception of sulfonamides. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that the use of antibiotics in the first year of life is associated with a small risk of developing asthma, and this risk increases with the number of courses of antibiotics prescribed.

AB  - Aim: It is essential educate general pediatricians about childhood asthma and its treatment to standardize care. The aim of this study was to evaluate knowledge and practice of pediatricians about childhood asthma and its treatment. Material and Method: The study included 52 pediatricians who attended one of the seven meetings about asthma treatment. A questionnaire of 42 questions, 23 about asthma and its treatment and 19 about their practice were given before meeting. Results: Hospital of residency did not change answers to the questions, but presence of private office and duration of practice did. Among pediatricians who owned private office, 82.4% said the sentence: 'systemic steroids have a role in acute asthma exacerbation treatment' was true, compared to the 47.1% of the ones without private office (p= 0.014). Referral to pediatric allergy center during or after acute asthma exacerbation was significantly lower among the pediatricians who owned private Office (p= 0.002 and p= 0.016 respectively). Duration of practice as a pediatrician influenced knowledge about use of inhaled steroids in asthma (p= .005). Conclusions: In conclusion, duration of practice and presence of private office influence knowledge and practice of general pediatricians about asthma and its treatment. The essence of postgraduate education to provide children more standardized treatment was emphasized with these results.

AB  - Background: The association between allergens in schools and childhood asthma has not been well studied, particularly in the United States.Objective: To investigate allergen exposure in schools compared with homes with a specific focus on children with asthma.Methods: Dust samples were collected from 46 rooms in 4 urban elementary schools (northeastern United States) and from 38 student bedrooms. Samples were analyzed for cat (Fel d 1), dog (Can f 1), cockroach (Bla g 2), dust mites (Der f 1/Der p 1), and mouse urinary protein (MUP). Questionnaires identified students with physician-diagnosed asthma.Results: Cat and dog allergens were detectable in most school samples (96% and 78%, respectively), but at low levels. Cockroach allergen was detectable in only 11% of school samples. Mouse allergen was detectable in 89% of school samples, with 68% having MUP levels greater than 0.5 microg/g. In contrast, MUP was detectable in only 26% of bedroom samples. Matched classroom and home samples from 23 asthmatic students showed higher geometric mean MUP levels in the classroom vs the home (6.45 microg/g vs 0.44 microg/g, P < .001). However, there were lower geometric mean dust mite (Der f 1) levels in the classroom vs the home (0.04 microg/g vs 0.66 microg/g, P < .001).Conclusions: There are significantly higher levels of MUP but lower levels of Der f 1 in schools vs homes. It is important to recognize that children with asthma may encounter varying levels of allergens in environments outside the home, such as schools.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: Virus-induced wheezing in infancy is a risk factor for asthma, and recent studies have highlighted the role of rhinoviruses in causing acute illnesses and as a possible contributing factor to chronic asthma.Recent Findings: Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) have long been known as the most common cause of common cold in infants and children. Recent developments in molecular diagnostics have led to the discovery of new viruses and have also provided data to implicate HRV as an important cause of lower respiratory infections and acute virus-induced wheezing in preschool children. In addition, HRV-induced wheezing episodes appear to identify children who are at increased risk for the subsequent development of childhood asthma.Summary: Collectively, these findings raise the possibility that lower respiratory infections with pathogens such as HRV and respiratory syncytial virus could participate in the causation of asthma, especially in children with suboptimal antiviral defenses. A variety of experimental models and clinical studies have been used to identify possible mechanisms related to the infection and the ensuing host response that could disturb normal lung and immunologic development to promote asthma. Defining these relationships could lead to new therapeutic and preventive approaches to common forms of childhood asthma.

AB  - Background: Although outdoor particulate matter (PM) has been linked to mortality and asthma morbidity, the impact of indoor PM on asthma has not been well established. Objective: This study was designed to investigate the effect of in-home PM on asthma morbidity. Methods: For a cohort of 150 asthmatic children (2-6 years of age) from Baltimore, Maryland, a technician deployed environmental monitoring equipment in the children's bedrooms for 3-day intervals at baseline and at 3 and 6 months. Caregivers completed questionnaires and daily diaries during air sampling. Longitudinal data analyses included regression models with generalized estimating equations. Results: Children were primarily African Americans (91%) from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and spent most of their time in the home. Mean (± SD) indoor PM2.5-10 (PM with aerodynamic diameter 2.5-10 µm) and PM2.5 (aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 µm) concentrations were 17.4 ± 21.0 and 40.3 ± 35.4 µg/m3. In adjusted models, 10-µg/m3 increases in indoor PM2.5-10 and PM2.5 were associated with increased incidences of asthma symptoms: 6% [95% confidence interval (CI) , 1 to 12%] and 3% (95% CI, -1 to 7%) , respectively ; symptoms causing children to slow down: 8% (95% CI, 2 to 14%) and 4% (95% CI, 0 to 9%) , respectively ; nocturnal symptoms: 8% (95% CI, 1 to 14%) and 6% (95% CI, 1 to 10%) , respectively ; wheezing that limited speech: 11% (95% CI, 3 to 19%) and 7% (95% CI, 0 to 14%) , respectively ; and use of rescue medication: 6% (95% CI, 1 to 10%) and 4% (95% CI, 1 to 8%) , respectively. Increases of 10 µg/m3 in indoor and ambient PM2.5 were associated with 7% (95% CI, 2 to 11%) and 26% (95% CI, 1 to 52%) increases in exercise-related symptoms, respectively. Conclusions: Among preschool asthmatic children in Baltimore, increases in in-home PM2.5-10 and PM2.5 were associated with respiratory symptoms and rescue medication use. Increases in in-home and ambient PM2.5 were associated with exercise-related symptoms. Although reducing PM outdoors may decrease asthma morbidity, reducing PM indoors, especially in homes of inner-city children, may lead to improved asthma health.

AB  - Extensive literature exists on potential risk factors for childhood asthma. To the authors' knowledge, no investigators have yet attempted to disentangle the effects of those determinants within a single study setting. The authors aimed to evaluate the independent effects of 47 potential determinants (from the prenatal, perinatal, and childhood periods) of asthma development in children within the first 10 years of life. From a Canadian birth cohort of 26,265 children (1990-2002), a 2-stage case-control study was conducted. In the first stage, 20 controls per case were selected from 3 administrative databases. In the second stage, selected mothers were mailed questionnaires for assessment of additional determinants. Increased risks of childhood asthma were found for > or =1 previous diagnosis of bronchopulmonary disease and atopic dermatitis in the child, oxygen administration after birth, prescription of antibiotics within the first 6 months of life, male gender, asthma during pregnancy, use of antibiotics during pregnancy, maternal receipt of social aid, paternal asthma, and asthma in siblings. Protective effects included use of intranasal corticosteroids during pregnancy, having a wood-burning fireplace, having pets in the home prior to the index date, breastfeeding, and day-care attendance. This study allowed the authors to identify, within a single setting, the most influential determinants of childhood asthma among 47 predictors assessed for the prenatal, perinatal, and childhood periods.

AB  - RATIONALE: Asthma treatment might improve when inhaled steroids are titrated on airway inflammation. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO0.05), a marker of eosinophilic airway inflammation, can be measured at home. OBJECTIVES: We assessed daily FeNO0.05 telemonitoring in the management of childhood asthma. METHODS: Children with atopic asthma (n = 151) were randomly assigned to two groups: FeNO0.05 plus symptom monitoring, or monitoring of symptoms only. All patients scored asthma symptoms in an electronic diary over 30 weeks; 77 received a portable nitric oxide (NO) analyzer. Data were transmitted daily to the coordinating centers. Patients were phoned every 3 weeks and their steroid dose was adapted according to FeNO0.05 and symptoms, or according to symptoms. Children were seen at 3, 12, 21, and 30 weeks for examination and lung function testing. The primary end point was the proportion of symptom-free days in the last 12 study weeks. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Telemonitoring was feasible with reliable FeNO0.05 data for 86% of days, and valid diary entries for 79% of days. Both groups showed an increase in symptom-free days, improvement of FEV1 and quality of life, and a reduction in steroid dose. None of the changes from baseline differed between groups. The difference in symptom-free days over the last 12 weeks was 0.3% (P = 0.95; 95% confidence interval, -10 to 11%). There was a trend for fewer exacerbations in the FeNO0.05 group. CONCLUSIONS: Thirty weeks of daily FeNO0.05 and symptom telemonitoring was associated with improved asthma control and a lower steroid dose. We found no added value of daily FeNO0.05 monitoring compared with daily symptom monitoring only.

AB  - RATIONALE: Asthma is associated with increased airway responsiveness (AR), but the age when this relationship becomes established is not clear. The present study tested the hypothesis that the association between increased AR and asthma is established after 1 month of age. OBJECTIVES: To relate AR in infancy to asthma in childhood. METHODS: As part of a birth cohort study, AR was determined at 1 (early infancy), 6 (mid-infancy), and 12 months of age (late infancy). At 11 years of age (childhood), AR and the presence of asthma symptoms were determined. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 253 study subjects enrolled, AR was determined in 202 in early infancy, 174 in mid-infancy, 147 in late infancy, and 176 in childhood. Increased AR in late infancy, but not in early or mid-infancy, was associated with increased wheeze at 11 years of age (P = 0.016). Increased AR in infancy persisted into childhood in association with male gender, early respiratory illness, and maternal smoking and asthma. Among the 116 subjects assessed in late infancy and childhood, recent wheeze was present in 35% of children with increased AR at both ages, 13% with increased AR in childhood only, 12% for those with increased AR in late infancy only, and 0% for those who did not have increased AR at either age (P = 0.023); the proportions of children with diagnosed asthma in the corresponding groups were 27, 20, 12, and 0% (P = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: The association between increased infantile AR and childhood asthma emerges at the end of the first year of life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are effective treatment for childhood asthma. Cross-sectional studies indicate that some asthmatic children are treated with excessively high doses of ICS and are at risk of serious adverse effects. OBJECTIVE: To describe longitudinal trends in asthma prescribing for children, with particular reference to very-high-dose (unlicensed) ICS prescribing. DESIGN: Retrospective, cross-sectional, observational study of general practitioner prescribing for asthma drugs in children aged under 12 years with a recorded asthma diagnosis between 1992 and 2004 using the General Practice Research Database (GPRD). RESULTS: Data were available for an average of 357,956 children per year. The percentage of children prescribed ICS increased from 2.7 in 1992 to 7.0 in 1997 and 1998 and then fell to 3.3 in 2004. In children under 5 years with asthma, very-high-dose ICS prescriptions (>400 microg/day) fell from 10.6% of all ICS prescriptions in 1992 to 4.5% by 2004. In contrast, very-high-dose ICS prescriptions (>800 microg/day) for asthmatic children aged 5-11 years rose from 1.1% in 1992 to 4.6% in 2004. Oral corticosteroid prescribing in under 5-year-olds who had been prescribed ICS fell from 37.1% in 1992 to 21.7% 1999 and remained constant thereafter; the respective percentages for those aged 5-11 years olds were 20.1 and 12.4. CONCLUSIONS: Trends for corticosteroid prescribing in childhood asthma changed dramatically between 1992 and 2004. There are several plausible reasons for this.

AB  - Background: The incidence and morbidity of wheezing illnesses and childhood asthma is especially high in poor urban areas. This paper describes the study design, methods, and population of the Urban Environment and Childhood Asthma (URECA) study, which was established to investigate the immunologic causes of asthma among inner-city children.Methods and Results: URECA is an observational prospective study that enrolled pregnant women in central urban areas of Baltimore, Boston, New York City, and St. Louis and is following their offspring from birth through age 7 years. The birth cohort consists of 560 inner-city children who have at least one parent with an allergic disease or asthma, and all families live in areas in which at least 20% of the population has incomes below the poverty line. In addition, 49 inner-city children with no parental history of allergies or asthma were enrolled. The primary hypothesis is that specific urban exposures in early life promote a unique pattern of immune development (impaired antiviral and increased Th2 responses) that increases the risk of recurrent wheezing and allergic sensitization in early childhood, and of asthma by age 7 years. To track immune development, cytokine responses of blood mononuclear cells stimulated ex vivo are measured at birth and then annually. Environmental assessments include allergen and endotoxin levels in house dust, pre- and postnatal maternal stress, and indoor air nicotine and nitrogen dioxide. Nasal mucous samples are collected from the children during respiratory illnesses and analyzed for respiratory viruses. The complex interactions between environmental exposures and immune development will be assessed with respect to recurrent wheeze at age 3 years and asthma at age 7 years.Conclusion: The overall goal of the URECA study is to develop a better understanding of how specific urban exposures affect immune development to promote wheezing illnesses and asthma.

AB  - Viruses are the predominant infectious cause of asthma exacerbations in the developed world. In addition, recent evidence strongly suggests that viral infections may also have a causal role in the development of childhood asthma. In this article, we will briefly describe the general perception of how the link between infections and asthma has changed over the last century, and then focus on very recent developments that have provided new insights into the contribution of viruses to asthma pathogenesis. Highlighted areas include the contribution of severe early life viral infections to asthma inception, genetic determinants of severe viral infections in infancy, the differences in innate and adaptive immune system cytokine responses to viral infection between asthmatic and nonasthmatic subjects, and a potential vaccine strategy to prevent severe early life virally-induced illness.

AB  - Allergen exposure is one of the environmental factors seemingly associated with the development of asthma. If asthma is a multi-factorial disease, it is hypothesised that prevention might only prove effective if most or all relevant environmental factors are simultaneously avoided. To assess effect(s) of monofaceted and multifaceted interventions compared with control interventions in preventing asthma and asthma symptoms in high risk children. We searched the Cochrane Airways Trials Register (December 2008). Randomised controlled trials of allergen exposure reduction for the primary prevention of asthma in children. Interventions were multifaceted (reducing exposure to both inhalant and food allergens) or monofaceted (reducing exposure to either inhalant or food allergens) Follow up had to be from birth (or during pregnancy) up to a minimum of two years of age. We included in the analysis studies assessing the primary outcome (current diagnosis: asthma) and/or one of the secondary outcomes (current respiratory symptoms: wheezing, nocturnal coughing and dyspnoea). We pooled multifaceted and monofaceted intervention trials separately. We made an indirect comparison of their effects using tests for interaction to calculate relative odds ratios. We included three multifaceted and six monofaceted intervention studies (3271 children). Physician diagnosed asthma in children less than five years, and asthma as defined by respiratory symptoms and lung function criteria in children aged five years and older, both favoured treatment with a multifaceted intervention compared to usual care (< 5 years: odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 0.96, and > 5 years: OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.85). However, there was no significant difference in outcome between monofaceted intervention and control interventions (< 5 years: OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.64, and > 5 years: OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.16). Indirect comparison between these treatments did not demonstrate a significant difference between multiple interventions and mono-interventions in reducing the frequency of asthma diagnosis in children under five years (relative OR 0.64 (95% CI 0.40 to 1.04, P = 0.07) or five years and older (relative OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.13, P = 0.12). There was also no significant difference between either mono- and multifaceted intervention and control in reducing the likelihood of symptoms of nocturnal coughing at follow up. Wheezing, however, showed a significant difference between multifaceted and mono-interventions (relative OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.99, P = 0.04), but the significance was lost when data on treatment only was analysed. The available evidence suggests that the reduction of exposure to multiple allergens compared to usual care reduces the likelihood of a current diagnosis of asthma in children (at ages < 5 years and 5 years and older). Mono-intervention studies have not produced effects which are statistically significant compared with control. In children who are at risk of developing childhood asthma, multifaceted interventions, characterised by dietary allergen reduction and environmental remediation, reduce the odds of a physician diagnosis of asthma later in childhood by half. This translates to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 17. The effect of multi-faceted interventions on parent reported wheeze was inconsistent and had no significant impact on nocturnal coughing or dyspnoea. Data from monofaceted intervention exposed children studies were not significantly different from those of control groups for all outcomes. There remains uncertainty as to whether multiple interventions are more effective than mono-component interventions. The comparisons made were indirect, making the conclusions drawn uncertain. To our knowledge there are no ongoing studies in which both intervention strategies are randomly compared. The findings, however, warrant further direct comparison between multiple- and monofaceted interventions aimed at reducing the prevalence of asthma in children.[CINAHL Note: The Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews contain interactive software that allows various calculations in the MetaView.]

AB  - Background: Variations in air pollution exposure within a community may be associated with asthma prevalence. However, studies conducted to date have produced inconsistent results, possibly due to errors in measurement of the exposures.Methods: A standardized asthma survey was administered to children in grades one and eight in Hamilton, Canada, in 1994-95 (N approximately 1467). Exposure to air pollution was estimated in four ways: (1) distance from roadways; (2) interpolated surfaces for ozone, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and nitrous oxides from seven to nine governmental monitoring stations; (3) a kriged nitrogen dioxide (NO2) surface based on a network of 100 passive NO2 monitors; and (4) a land use regression (LUR) model derived from the same monitoring network. Logistic regressions were used to test associations between asthma and air pollution, controlling for variables including neighbourhood income, dwelling value, state of housing, a deprivation index and smoking.Results: There were no significant associations between any of the exposure estimates and asthma in the whole population, but large effects were detected the subgroup of children without hayfever (predominately in girls). The most robust effects were observed for the association of asthma without hayfever and NO2LUR OR = 1.86 (95%CI, 1.59-2.16) in all girls and OR = 2.98 (95%CI, 0.98-9.06) for older girls, over an interquartile range increase and controlling for confounders.Conclusion: Our findings indicate that traffic-related pollutants, such as NO2, are associated with asthma without overt evidence of other atopic disorders among female children living in a medium-sized Canadian city. The effects were sensitive to the method of exposure estimation. More refined exposure models produced the most robust associations.

AB  - Background: We evaluated the impact of migration to the USA-Mexico border city of El Paso, Texas (USA), parental language preference, and Hispanic ethnicity on childhood asthma to differentiate between its social and environmental determinants.Methods: Allergy and asthma prevalence was surveyed among 9797 fourth and fifth grade children enrolled in the El Paso Independent School District. Parents completed a respiratory health questionnaire, in either English or Spanish, and a sub-sample of children received spirometry testing at their school. Here we report asthma and allergy outcomes across ethnicity and El Paso residency duration.Results: Asthma and allergy prevalence increased with longer duration of El Paso residency independent of ethnicity and preferred language. Compared with immigrants who arrived in El Paso after entering first grade (18%), lifelong El Paso residents (68%) had more prevalent allergy (OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.32 - 2.24), prevalent asthma (OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.24 - 2.46), and current asthma (OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.37 - 2.95). Spirometric measurements (FEV1/FVC and FEF25-75) also declined with increasing duration of El Paso residency (0.16% and 0.35% annual reduction, respectively).Conclusion: These findings suggest that a community-wide environmental exposure in El Paso, delayed pulmonary development, or increased health of immigrants may be associated with allergy and asthma development in children raised there.

AB  - PURPOSE. The major purpose of this study was to explore the effect of routines on asthma management and morbidity outcomes for children with asthma and their parents. DESIGN AND METHODS. This study is a secondary data analysis in a sample of 150 children, which was originally used for an intervention study. RESULTS. Parents who had fewer routines in their homes had lower quality-of-life scores and higher burden of asthma scores when compared to parents in households with more routines. More routines were associated with improved asthma morbidity outcomes as measured by nurse rankings of routines. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS. Assisting families to establish routines may result in improved asthma morbidity outcomes.

AB  - Objectives. This study used a Cox proportional hazards model to determine whether neighborhood characteristics are associated with risk of readmission for childhood asthma independently of individual characteristics. Methods. Rhode Island Hospital Discharge Data from 2001 to 2005 were used to identify children younger than 19 years of age at the time of the index (i.e., first) asthma admission, defined as a primary diagnosis of asthma or a primary diagnosis of respiratory illness with a secondary or tertiary diagnosis of asthma (n=2,919). Hazard ratios of repeat hospitalizations for childhood asthma from 2001 to 2005 were estimated, controlling for individual-and neighborhoodlevel variables. Results. During the study period, 15% of the sample was readmitted for asthma (n= 451). In the unadjusted cumulative hazard curves, children residing in the census tracts with the highest proportion of crowded housing conditions, racial minority residents, or neighborhood-level poverty had higher cumulative hospital readmission rates as compared with children who resided in less disadvantaged neighborhoods. In the fully adjusted models, children insured by Medicaid at the time of their index admission had readmission rates that were 33% higher than children who were privately insured. Conclusion. Our findings suggest that differences in health-care coverage are associated with higher readmission rates for pediatric asthma, but the relationship between neighborhood inequality and repeat hospitalizations for pediatric asthma requires further exploration. Social indicators such as minority race, Medicaid health insurance, and neighborhood markers of economic disadvantage are tightly interwoven in the U.S. and teasing these relationships apart is important in asthma disparities research .

AB  - Despite understanding the physiologic effects of childhood asthma, less is known about how children perceive living with asthma. We undertook semistructured, in-depth interviews with 11 boys and 11 girls (all aged 11) drawn from a larger ongoing asthma study of Manitoba children born in 1995. All had asthma, as diagnosed by a pediatric allergist. We sought to further understand how children perceive asthma. Children spoke of feeling different and commonly used words such as 'pain' and 'hurt.' We have categorized children's strategies to normalize their lives as (a) minimizing the health impact, (b) stressing normality, (c) emphasizing abilities, (d) making adaptations in daily living, and, (e) managing symptoms with medications. These findings suggest that aspects of other researchers' work regarding normalization efforts of children with various chronic diseases also apply in a chronic condition that is less obvious.

AB  - Background: Glucocorticoid function is dependent on efficient translocation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) from the cytoplasm to the nucleus of cells. Importin-13 (IPO13) is a nuclear transport receptor that mediates nuclear entry of GR. In airway epithelial cells, inhibition of IPO13 expression prevents nuclear entry of GR and abrogates anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids. Impaired nuclear entry of GR has been documented in steroid-non-responsive asthmatics. We hypothesize that common IPO13 genetic variation influences the anti-inflammatory effects of inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of asthma, as measured by change in methacholine airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR-PC20).Methods: 10 polymorphisms were evaluated in 654 children with mild-to-moderate asthma participating in the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP), a clinical trial of inhaled anti-inflammatory medications (budesonide and nedocromil). Population-based association tests with repeated measures of PC20 were performed using mixed models and confirmed using family-based tests of association.Results: Among participants randomized to placebo or nedocromil, IPO13 polymorphisms were associated with improved PC20 (i.e. less AHR), with subjects harboring minor alleles demonstrating an average 1.51-2.17 fold increase in mean PC20 at 8-months post-randomization that persisted over four years of observation (p = 0.01-0.005). This improvement was similar to that among children treated with long-term inhaled corticosteroids. There was no additional improvement in PC20 by IPO13 variants among children treated with inhaled corticosteroids.Conclusion: IPO13 variation is associated with improved AHR in asthmatic children. The degree of this improvement is similar to that observed with long-term inhaled corticosteroid treatment, suggesting that IPO13 variation may improve nuclear bioavailability of endogenous glucocorticoids.

AB  - Rationale: Bronchiolitis during infancy is associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma. Whether winter viral infections cause asthma or are a manifestation of a predisposition to asthma development is unknown.Objectives: To study the relationship of winter virus infection during infancy and the development of childhood asthma.Methods: We studied over 95,000 infants born between 1995 and 2000 and followed through 2005 who were enrolled in the Tennessee Medicaid program from birth through early childhood to determine whether infant birth in relationship to the winter virus peak alters the risk of developing early childhood asthma.Measurements and Main Results: Among 95,310 children studied during five winter virus seasons from birth through early childhood, the risk of developing asthma tracked with the timing of infant birth in relationship to the winter virus peak. Infant birth approximately 4 months before the winter virus peak carried the highest risk, with a 29% increase in odds of developing asthma compared with birth 12 months before the peak (adjusted odds ratio, 1.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-1.40). Infant age at the winter virus peak was comparable to or greater than other known risk factors for asthma.Conclusions: Timing of birth in relationship to winter virus season confers a differential and definable risk of developing early childhood asthma, establishing winter virus seasonality as a causal factor in asthma development. Delay of exposure or prevention of winter viral infection during early infancy could prevent asthma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The association between chronic exposure to air pollution and adverse health outcomes has not been well studied. OBJECTIVE: This project investigated the impact of chronic exposure to high ozone levels on childhood asthma admissions in New York State. METHODS: We followed a birth cohort born in New York State during 1995--1999 to first asthma admission or until 31 December 2000. We identified births and asthma admissions through the New York State Integrated Child Health Information System and linked these data with ambient ozone data (8-hr maximum) from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. We defined chronic ozone exposure using three indicators: mean concentration during the followup period, mean concentration during the ozone season, and proportion of follow-up days with ozone levels > 70 ppb. We performed logistic regression analysis to adjust for child's age, sex, birth weight, and gestational age; maternal race/ethnicity, age, education, insurance status, smoking during pregnancy, and poverty level; and geographic region, temperature, and copollutants. RESULTS: Asthma admissions were significantly associated with increased ozone levels for all chronic exposure indicators (odds ratios, 1.16--1.68), with a positive dose--response relationship. We found stronger associations among younger children, low sociodemographic groups, and New York City residents as effect modifiers. CONCLUSION: Chronic exposure to ambient ozone may increase the risk of asthma admissions among children. Younger children and those in low socioeconomic groups have a greater risk of asthma than do other children at the same ozone level.

AB  - Methods of ascertaining and defining asthma in epidemiologic research vary, and the extent of agreement between such measures is not clearly understood. Within a broader investigation of early-life farm exposures and risk of childhood asthma and other atopic conditions, the authors sought to generate and compare population-based estimates of asthma prevalence among farm children using several definitions, based on both parental report and medical chart review. The Marshfield Epidemiologic Study Area (MESA) is a geographically defined, population-based cohort that receives nearly all health care from Marshfield Clinic and affiliated institutions. The region includes about 2200 farms, and over 9500 children aged 5 to 17 years who were born in the region served as the study population. A stratified random sample of 1000 overselecting for likely farm resident children was drawn. Parents of 553 children completed the survey and gave permission to review medical records. Informative records were available for 531 (96%). A weighted analysis provided estimates for the full study population. Asthma ascertainment included parental reports of past asthma diagnosis, history of wheezing, and asthma medication use, as well as documentation of asthma diagnoses and medication use in the medical chart. Prevalence of asthma among farm children using a broad composite definition was 24.8%. Prevalence based on parental reports of a specific asthma diagnosis was 11.2%, whereas medical chart documentation of a past asthma diagnosis was found for 10.1% of farm children. Seventy-one percent of parental reports were validated in the charts, and 80% of chart-confirmed diagnoses were reported by the parent. Basing asthma prevalence for farm children on a history of asthma medication use gave a higher estimate than did history of a diagnosis. Of farm children, 19.2% reported wheezing or respiratory whistling, with 8.1% occurring in the past year. Observational research on asthma can be substantially influenced by ascertainment methods and case definitions. Although prevalence estimates based on a past asthma diagnosis were quantitatively similar for parental reports and chart confirmation, agreement on specific cases between the two sources was less than expected. Care should be taken to clearly describe asthma case definitions when reporting results of observational asthma research.

AB  - Purpose: This retrospective study is an investigation of the relationship between traffic exposure and childhood asthma exacerbations in a previously unstudied geographic area. We hypothesized that, controlling for selected demographic and social factors, exposure to traffic emissions would allow the prediction of hospital utilization for children with asthma. Design: Using hospital and emergency department (ED) records, we investigated the relationship between proximity to major roadways and admissions for asthma exacerbations in the Fort Worth metropolitan area, designated as not attaining federal air health standards. The sample included 2,357 children from 1 to 12 years of age admitted for emergency or inpatient treatment in a 288-bed, nonprofit children's medical center in Fort Worth, Texas from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2005. Data were analyzed using GIS mapping and logistic regression. Methods: Deidentification data were collected from hospital databases after IRB approval and waiver of parental permission or patient consent. Student's t test was used to compare groups with and without primary asthma diagnosis on admission in respect to distance from major roadways. Logistic regression was used to model relationships between asthma admission and patients' characteristics, exposure to traffic, and social environment. Findings: Controlling for several demographic factors, asthma occurrences were positively related to traffic exposures. On average, patients with asthma lived closer to major roadways than did patients who did not have asthma. Patients with asthma also tended to live in neighborhoods with more roads than did those who did not have asthma; 3/4 of the children admitted for asthma during the study period and less than 1/3 of the children admitted for nonasthma diagnoses lived within 1,500 meters of a major roadway (p=.0001). Controlling for other factors, every meter increase in proximity to major roadways produced 0.1% increase in likelihood of admission. Clinical Relevance: Knowledge of risk factors and their relative magnitudes enable nurses to better tailor symptom management for individual patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In urban communities with high prevalence of childhood asthma, school-based educational programs may be the most appropriate approach to deliver interventions to improve asthma morbidity and asthma-related outcomes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the implementation of Kickin' Asthma, a school-based asthma curriculum designed by health educators and local students, which teaches asthma physiology and asthma self-management techniques to middle and high school students in Oakland, CA.METHODS: Eligible students were identified through an in-class asthma case identification survey. Approximately 10-15 students identified as asthmatic were recruited for each series of the Kickin' Asthma intervention. The curriculum was delivered by an asthma nurse in a series of four 50-minute sessions. Students completed a baseline and a 3-month follow-up survey that compared symptom frequency, health care utilization, activity limitations, and medication use.RESULTS: Of the 8488 students surveyed during the first 3 years of the intervention (2003-2006), 15.4% (n = 1309) were identified as asthmatic; approximately 76% of eligible students (n = 990) from 15 middle schools and 3 high schools participated in the program. Comparison of baseline to follow-up data indicated that students experienced significantly fewer days with activity limitations and significantly fewer nights of sleep disturbance after participation in the intervention. For health care utilization, students reported significantly less frequent emergency department visits or hospitalizations between the baseline and follow-up surveys.CONCLUSIONS: A school-based asthma curriculum designed specifically for urban students has been shown to reduce symptoms, activity limitations, and health care utilization for intervention participants.

AB  - Rationale: Virus-induced wheezing episodes in infancy often precede the development of asthma. Whether infections with specific viral pathogens confer differential future asthma risk is incompletely understood.Objectives: To define the relationship between specific viral illnesses and early childhood asthma development.Methods: A total of 259 children were followed prospectively from birth to 6 years of age. The etiology and timing of specific viral wheezing respiratory illnesses during early childhood were assessed using nasal lavage, culture, and multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The relationships of these virus-specific wheezing illnesses and other risk factors to the development of asthma were analyzed.Measurements and Main Results: Viral etiologies were identified in 90% of wheezing illnesses. From birth to age 3 years, wheezing with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (odds ratio [OR], 2.6), rhinovirus (RV) (OR, 9.8), or both RV and RSV (OR , 10) was associated with increased asthma risk at age 6 years. In Year 1, both RV wheezing (OR, 2.8) and aeroallergen sensitization (OR, 3.6) independently increased asthma risk at age 6 years. By age 3 years, wheezing with RV (OR, 25.6) was more strongly associated with asthma at age 6 years than aeroallergen sensitization (OR, 3.4). Nearly 90% (26 of 30) of children who wheezed with RV in Year 3 had asthma at 6 years of age.Conclusions: Among outpatient viral wheezing illnesses in infancy and early childhood, those caused by RV infections are the most significant predictors of the subsequent development of asthma at age 6 years in a high-risk birth cohort.

AB  - Rationale: Inhaled beta-agonists are one of the most widely used classes of drugs for the treatment of asthma. However, a substantial proportion of patients with asthma do not have a favorable response to these drugs, and identifying genetic determinants of drug response may aid in tailoring treatment for individual patients.Objectives: To screen variants in candidate genes in the steroid and beta-adrenergic pathways for association with response to inhaled beta-agonists.Methods: We genotyped 844 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 111 candidate genes in 209 children and their parents participating in the Childhood Asthma Management Program. We screened the association of these SNPs with acute response to inhaled beta-agonists (bronchodilator response [BDR]) using a novel algorithm implemented in a family-based association test that ranked SNPs in order of statistical power. Genes that had SNPs with median power in the highest quartile were then taken for replication analyses in three other asthma cohorts.Measurements and Main Results: We identified 17 genes from the screening algorithm and genotyped 99 SNPs from these genes in a second population of patients with asthma. We then genotyped 63 SNPs from four genes with significant associations with BDR, for replication in a third and fourth population of patients with asthma. Evidence for association from the four asthma cohorts was combined, and SNPs from ARG1 were significantly associated with BDR. SNP rs2781659 survived Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (combined P value = 0.00048, adjusted P value = 0.047).Conclusions: These findings identify ARG1 as a novel gene for acute BDR in both children and adults with asthma.

AB  - Background: Although it is known that most patients do not consistently take controller medications every day, the impact of nonadherence on asthma control is not well documented.Objective: To establish the relationship between medication adherence and symptom control in adolescents and young adults with asthma.Methods: A total of 756 adolescents and young adults diagnosed as having mild to moderate asthma on entry into the original study underwent 6 monthly telephone interviews as an ancillary project to the Childhood Asthma Management Program Continuation Study. Participants were queried about medication use and symptom control within each 1-month interview window. Strategies adopted to improve self-report accuracy included use of repeated interviews, confidential reporting to staff unknown to the participants, and use of questions focused on recent behavior.Results: Only participants who were consistently on inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) for the entire 6-month study interval were included. Three groups of patients were contrasted: those not on ICSs (n = 420), those on ICSs with high adherence (> or = 75% of medication taken, n = 90), and those on ICSs with low/medium adherence (< 75% of medication taken, n = 148). Participants in the low/medium adherence group reported, on average, less symptom control and more variability in wheezing, awakening at night, missed activities, and beta2-agonist use during the 6-month period, although most in this group perceived their asthma to be under good control.Conclusion: Despite extensive patient education and support, diminished ICS adherence was frequent and undermined symptom control in this group of adolescents and young adults with mild to moderate asthma.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review and summarize trends in the current literature in childhood asthma with implications for current management and future research. RECENT FINDINGS: There have been several articles in the last year that address the pathogenesis and pharmacogenomics of asthma. Recent consensus guidelines have been published that emphasize a stepwise approach to management, which will be briefly reviewed here. Several publications have proposed novel treatments to attempt to attenuate asthmatic lower airway inflammation. In terms of measuring this inflammation, a portable exhaled nitric oxide analyzer has been developed. SUMMARY: Evidence shows that various early life exposures (high house dust mite levels, early antibiotic use) may predispose susceptible individuals to the development of asthma, but the early introduction of solid foods, even so-called allergenic foods, does not appear to be one of these factors. Newly identified pharmacogenomic markers may be the first step in tailoring each asthmatic patient's therapy on the basis of genotype, and management tailored specifically toward each patient's level of airway inflammation is already coming into wider clinical use. Several novel treatments for asthma have shown promise in early studies. On the basis of the most recent evidence, the National Education and Prevention Program's Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma is a comprehensive, stepwise management guide for asthma.

AB  - UK asthma prevalence fell significantly between 1993 and 2000. In children aged <5 years hospital admissions for asthma fell by 52% and primary care presentations in children under 14 years by over 40%. From 1994 to 2000, primary care consultations for acute respiratory infections in all age groups fell by 36%, and for the common cold by 46%. Isolates for respiratory syncytial virus notified to the Health Protection Agency voluntary reporting scheme fell by 56% between 1993 and 2003. Falls in UK birth rate and improvements in living conditions were reported by the Office of National Statistics over this time. The authors hypothesise that the fall in asthma reflects a fall in respiratory infections, the most important proximal trigger for asthma exacerbations, and that this in turn may be related to a fall in household members to a number too low for effective virus transmission. Future research into the prevalence of asthma must consider the effect of changing respiratory virus burden on populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite extensive evidence that air pollution affects childhood asthma, state-level and national-level tracking of asthma outcomes in relation to air pollution is limited. OBJECTIVES: Our goals were to evaluate the feasibility of linking the 2001 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS), air monitoring, and traffic data; estimate associations between traffic density (TD) or outdoor air pollutant concentrations and childhood asthma morbidity; and evaluate the usefulness of such databases, linkages, and analyses to Environmental Public Health Tracking (EPHT). METHODS: We estimated TD within 500 feet of residential cross-streets of respondents and annual average pollutant concentrations based on monitoring station measurements. We used logistic regression to examine associations with reported asthma symptoms and emergency department (ED) visits/hospitalizations. RESULTS: Assignment of TD and air pollution exposures for cross-streets was successful for 82% of children with asthma in Los Angeles and San Diego, California, Counties. Children with asthma living in high ozone areas and areas with high concentrations of particulate matter < 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter experienced symptoms more frequently, and those living close to heavy traffic reported more ED visits/hospitalizations. The advantages of the CHIS for asthma EPHT include a large and representative sample, biennial data collection, and ascertainment of important sociodemographic and residential address information. Disadvantages are its cross-sectional design, reliance on parental reports of diagnoses and symptoms, and lack of information on some potential confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limitations, the CHIS provides a useful framework for examining air pollution and childhood asthma morbidity in support of EPHT, especially because later surveys address some noted gaps. We plan to employ CHIS 2003 and 2005 data and novel exposure assessment methods to re-examine the questions raised here.

AB  - Rationale: Airway responsiveness is a prognostic marker for asthma symptoms in later life.Objectives: To evaluate characteristics responsible for persistence of airway responsiveness in children with asthma.Methods: A total of 1,041 children, initially aged 5-12 years, with mild to moderate persistent asthma enrolled in the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) were studied prospectively for 8.6 +/- 1.8 years with methacholine challenges yearly.Measurements and Main Results: Least squares geometric mean models were fit to determine effects of sex and age on airway responsiveness (provocative concentration producing 20% decrease in FEV(1) [PC(20)]). Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to determine factors at baseline and over time, which were associated with PC(20) at end of follow-up. A total of 7,748 methacholine challenges were analyzed. PC(20) increased with age, with boys having greater increase after age 11 years than girls (P < 0.001). The divergence coincided with the mean age for Tanner stage 2. Postpubertal girls had greater airway responsiveness, even after adjustment for FEV(1) and other potential confounders. Although multivariable regression analyses noted a variety of factors that influenced airway responsivness in both sexes, a history of hay fever (beta= -0.30, P = 0.005), respiratory allergy (beta= -0.32, P = 0.006), or recent inhaled corticosteroid usage (beta= -0.18, P = 0.02) were associated with decrements in final log PC(20) only in girls.Conclusions: Airway responsiveness (PC(20)) is more severe in the postpubertal female with asthma than in males. Although there are factors associated with airway responsiveness in both males and females, sex-specific factors may contribute to new insights into asthma pathogenesis.

AB  - Background: Asthma, a serious health problem worldwide, is becoming more common. Colonization with Helicobacter pylori, a major human indigenous (commensal) microbe, during early life may be relevant to the risk of childhood asthma.Methods: We conducted cross-sectional analyses, using data from 7412 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2000, to assess the association between H. pylori and childhood asthma.Results: H. pylori seropositivity was inversely associated with onset of asthma before 5 years of age and current asthma in children aged 3-13 years. Among participants 3-19 years of age, the presence of H. pylori was inversely related to ever having had asthma (odds ratio [OR], 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45-1.06), and the inverse association with onset of asthma before 5 years of age was stronger (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.38-0.88). Among participants 3-13 years of age, H. pylori positivity was significantly inversely associated with current asthma (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.24-0.69). H. pylori seropositivity also was inversely related to recent wheezing, allergic rhinitis, and dermatitis, eczema, or rash.Conclusions: This study is the first to report an inverse association between H. pylori seropositivity and asthma in children. The findings indicate new directions for research and asthma prevention.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of inhaled budesonide given daily or as-needed on mild persistent childhood asthma. Patients, design and INTERVENTIONS: 176 children aged 5-10 years with newly detected asthma were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: (1) continuous budesonide (400 microg twice daily for 1 month, 200 microg twice daily for months 2-6, 100 microg twice daily for months 7-18); (2) budesonide, identical treatment to group 1 during months 1-6, then budesonide for exacerbations as needed for months 7-18; and (3) disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) 10 mg three times daily for months 1-18. Exacerbations were treated with budesonide 400 microg twice daily for 2 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Lung function, the number of exacerbations and growth. RESULTS: Compared with DSCG the initial regular budesonide treatment resulted in a significantly improved lung function, fewer exacerbations and a small but significant decline in growth velocity. After 18 months, however, the lung function improvements did not differ between the groups. During months 7-18, patients receiving continuous budesonide treatment had significantly fewer exacerbations (mean 0.97), compared with 1.69 in group 2 and 1.58 in group 3. The number of asthma-free days did not differ between regular and intermittent budesonide treatment. Growth velocity was normalised during continuous low-dose budesonide and budesonide therapy given as needed. The latter was associated with catch-up growth. CONCLUSIONS: Regular use of budesonide afforded better asthma control but had a more systemic effect than did use of budesonide as needed. The dose of ICS could be reduced as soon as asthma is controlled. Some children do not seem to need continuous ICS treatment.

AB  - Background: Asthma control remains suboptimal in adults and children worldwide. Inhaled salmeterol/fluticasone propionate combination (SFC) and oral montelukast (MON) are 2 treatments available for childhood asthma.Objective: This study, the PEdiatric Asthma Control Evaluation (PEACE), investigated the efficacy and tolerability of SFC compared with MON for the control of persistent asthma in children.Methods: Children with asthma (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV[1]] 55%-80% predicted; reversibility >/=12%) aged 6 to 14 years who were receiving only short-acting beta[2]-agonists entered a 2-week run-in period. Symptomatic patients (rescue use or symptoms during 4 of the last 7 days) were randomized to double-blind, double-dummy treatment with SFC 50/100 microg BID via multidose dry powder inhaler or MON 5-mg tablet QD for 12 weeks. The primary end point was change from baseline in morning peak expiratory flow (PEF). Efficacy assessments included lung function, asthma symptoms, rescue medication use, and asthma control. Tolerability was assessed by recording the number and type of adverse events (AEs) and the number of asthma exacerbations.Results: Of 607 patients screened, 548 were randomized to treatment. The SFC group contained 281 patients and the MON group included 267. Demographic characteristics and baseline data were similar for both groups (mean age, 9.3 years for both groups; mean [SD] FEV[1], 1.49 [0.43] L in the SFC group and 1.48 [0.43] L in the MON group). There were more males in the MON group (179 [67%]) than in the SFC group (156 [56%]). The adjusted mean (SE) changes from baseline in morning PEF were 45.88 (2.82) L/min with SFC and 28.7 (2.86) L/min with MON (treatment difference, 17.16 L/min; 95% CI, 9.23-25.08; P < 0.001). Compared with MON, the SFC group had significantly more asthma symptom-free days (odds ratio [OR], 1.74; 95% CI, 1.07-2.82; P = 0.025), more rescue-free days (OR, 3.24; 95% CI, 2.09-5.02; P < 0.001), and more asthma-controlled weeks (difference in treatment medians over weeks 1-12, 16.77%; 95% CI, 8.3-16.77; P < 0.001). Both treatments were well tolerated, with a similar number of patients reporting AEs (SFC group, 155/281 [55%]; MON group, 153/267 [57%]); the most common AE in both groups was headache (SFC group, 66 [23%]; MON group, 72 [27%]). The mean exacerbation rates over 12 weeks (post hoc analysis) were 0.12 in the SFC group and 0.30 in the MON group (SFC/MON ratio, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.29-0.57; P < 0.001).Conclusions: In these children with uncontrolled asthma previously on short-acting beta[2]-agonist monotherapy (% predicted FEV[1] <80%, frequent asthma symptoms and rescue medication use), treatment with SFC was significantly more effective in improving morning PEF and other measures of asthma control and in decreasing exacerbation rates (in a post hoc analysis) than treatment with MON. The 2 drugs were both well tolerated, with similar numbers and types of AEs reported.

AB  - The etiology and morbidity associated with asthma are thought to stem from both genetic factors and potentially modifiable environmental factors, such as viral infections. Although it is unclear whether respiratory viral infections cause asthma, observational studies have demonstrated a high rate of asthma in children with a history of severe viral lower respiratory tract infections during infancy, and viruses are associated with the majority of asthma exacerbations among both children and adults. This article discusses the pathogens associated with virus-induced wheezing illnesses during infancy and early childhood, the association of bronchiolitis during infancy with an increased risk of childhood asthma, and the association of respiratory viruses with asthma exacerbations in older children and adults.

AB  - Exposure to a farming environment protects individuals from respiratory allergy. The timing and duration of exposure seem to play critical roles. The largest reduction in risk of developing respiratory allergies is seen among those who are exposed prenatally and continuously thereafter. Contact with farm animals, at least in childhood, likely confers protection; other factors have not been completely identified. Also, the consumption of milk directly from the farm during childhood has been shown to be beneficial with respect to childhood asthma and allergies. Increased levels of microbial substances may contribute to the protective effects. The mechanisms by which such environmental exposures confer protection from respiratory allergies are not well understood. A number of gene-by-environment interactions have been observed with polymorphisms in genes of innate immunity receptors and exposure to farming environments. Increased levels of microbial exposures recognized by innate immune responses may affect adaptive immune responses resulting in decreased levels of atopic sensitization and asthma.

AB  - The prevalence of asthma has increased in developed countries. The efficacy of available drugs in those with severe persistent disease is limited. This has led to a renewed search for the reasons for failures of the existing treatment and for novel concepts. Treatment with inhaled corticosteroids, and to a much lesser extent theophylline, can reduce the survival of inflammatory cells including eosinophils. Emerging trends in treatments for asthma could include strategies to alter the cytokine/chemokine balance. It is evident that the current ICS are already very efficient and safe, it will be difficult to introduce further improved formulations. Perhaps the most fruitful effort shall be in developing patient friendly easy to use targeted delivery systems. The newer therapies are planned for the several upstream targets and may have potential to prevent the disease. Various potential therapies are being worked upon like-targeting prevention of T cell activation, modulation of Th-1/Th-2 differentiation, inhibition of Th-2 related cytokines, Th-1/Th-2 modulation, inhibition of downstream mediators etc. The new strategy shall perhaps lie with matching the patients and their disease with the most suitable therapy.

AB  - RATIONALE: Maternal diet during pregnancy has the potential to affect airway development and to promote T-helper-2-cell responses during fetal life. This might increase the risk of developing childhood asthma or allergy. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the influence of maternal food consumption during pregnancy on childhood asthma outcomes from 1 to 8 years of age. METHODS: A birth cohort study consisting of a baseline of 4,146 pregnant women (1,327 atopic and 2,819 nonatopic). These women were asked about their frequency of consumption of fruit, vegetables, fish, egg, milk, milk products, nuts, and nut products during the last month. Their children were followed until 8 years of age. Longitudinal analyses were conducted to assess associations between maternal diet during pregnancy and childhood asthma outcomes over 8 years. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Complete data were obtained for 2,832 children. There were no associations between maternal vegetable, fish, egg, milk or milk products, and nut consumption and longitudinal childhood outcomes. Daily consumption of nut products increased the risk of childhood wheeze (odds ratio [OR] daily versus rare consumption, 1.42; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.06-1.89), dyspnea (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.16-2.15), steroid use (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.06-2.46), and asthma symptoms (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.08-1.99). CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study indicate an increased risk of daily versus rare consumption of nut products during pregnancy on childhood asthma outcomes. These findings need to be replicated by other studies before dietary advice can be given to pregnant women.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify factors that impact asthma morbidity in rural school-aged children. DESIGN: Exploratory analysis of baseline data collected in a longitudinal intervention study was performed. SETTING: Four rural school districts that served small towns and unincorporated areas participated in this study. SAMPLE: Participants were children in grades 2 to 5 who had current asthma and who spoke English or Spanish. There were 183 children (108 boys, 75 girls) with an average age of 8.78 years and who were Hispanic (46%), white (31%), or African American (22%). METHODS: Associations between asthma risk factors (gender, ethnicity/race, socioeconomic status, asthma severity), asthma resources (access to care, health insurance), family asthma management, and asthma morbidity (absenteeism, emergency department visits, hospitalizations) were analyzed. FINDINGS: Children with more severe asthma had higher absenteeism and more hospitalizations, and their parents performed more asthma management behaviors. Families who had difficulty accessing care had more hospitalizations and emergency department visits and were more likely to be poor. More boys, more Hispanic and African American children, and more children from poorer families were hospitalized for asthma than were middle-class and non-Hispanic white children. CONCLUSIONS: Asthma is a chronic condition that is fairly easy for some families to manage, whereas other families are having higher asthma morbidity that needs to be addressed through targeted interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous research has documented effects of both physical and social environmental exposures on childhood asthma. However, few studies have considered how these two environments might interact to affect asthma. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to test interactions between chronic exposure to traffic-related air pollution and chronic family stress in predicting biologic and clinical outcomes in children with asthma. METHOD: Children with asthma (n = 73, 9-18 years of age) were interviewed about life stress, and asthma-relevant inflammatory markers [cytokine production, immunoglobulin E (IgE), eosinophil counts] were measured. Parents reported on children's symptoms. Children completed daily diaries of symptoms and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) measures at baseline and 6 months later. Exposure to traffic-related air pollution was assessed using a land use regression model for nitrogen dioxide concentrations. RESULTS: NO(2) by stress interactions were found for interleukin-5 (beta for interaction term = -0.31, p = 0.02), IgE (interaction beta = -0.29, p = 0.02), and eosinophil counts (interaction beta = -0.24, p = 0.04). These interactions showed that higher chronic stress was associated with heightened inflammatory profiles as pollution levels decreased. Longitudinally, NO(2) by stress interactions emerged for daily diary symptoms (interaction beta = -0.28, p = 0.02), parent-reported symptoms (interaction beta = -0.25, p = 0.07), and PEFR (interaction beta = 0.30, p = 0.03). These interactions indicated that higher chronic stress was associated with increases over time in symptoms and decreases over time in PEFR as pollution levels decreased. CONCLUSIONS: The physical and social environments interacted in predicting both biologic and clinical outcomes in children with asthma, suggesting that when pollution exposure is more modest, vulnerability to asthma exacerbations may be heightened in children with higher chronic stress.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of childhood asthma in the USA increased by 50% from 1980 to 2000, with especially high prevalence in poor urban communities. METHODS: Data on the prevalence of asthma among children aged 4-5 years and on hospitalisations for asthma among children less than 15 years old were available for 42 health service catchment areas within New York City. Street tree counts were provided by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. The proximity to pollution sources, sociodemographic characteristics and population density for each area were also measured. RESULTS: Controlling for potential confounders, an increase in tree density of 1 standard deviation (SD, 343 trees/km(2)) was associated with a lower prevalence of asthma (RR, 0.71 per SD of tree density; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.79), but not with hospitalisations for asthma (RR, 0.89 per SD of tree density; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.06). CONCLUSIONS: Street trees were associated with a lower prevalence of early childhood asthma. This study does not permit inference that trees are causally related to asthma at the individual level. The PlaNYC sustainability initiative, which includes a commitment to plant one million trees by the year 2017, offers an opportunity for a large prospective evaluation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Systemic corticosteroids are known to induce osteoporosis and increase the risk for fractures in adults and children. Inhaled corticosteroids have been shown to increase the risk for osteoporosis and fractures in adults at risk; however, long-term prospective studies of children to assess risks of multiple short courses of oral corticosteroids and chronic inhaled corticosteroids have not been performed. Thus, we assessed the effects of multiple short courses of oral corticosteroids and long-term inhaled corticosteroids on bone mineral accretion over a period of years. METHODS: This was a cohort follow-up study for a median of 7 years of children who had mild-to-moderate asthma and initially were randomly assigned into the Childhood Asthma Management Program trial. Serial dual-energy radiograph absorptiometry scans of the lumbar spine for bone mineral density were performed for all patients. Annual bone mineral accretion was calculated for 531 boys and 346 girls who had asthma and were aged 5 to 12 years at baseline (84% of the initial cohort). RESULTS: Oral corticosteroid bursts produced a dosage-dependent reduction in bone mineral accretion (0.052, 0.049, and 0.046 g/cm(2) per year) and an increase in risk for osteopenia (10%, 14%, and 21%) for 0, 1 to 4, and >or=5 courses, respectively, in boys but not girls. Cumulative inhaled corticosteroid use was associated with a small decrease in bone mineral accretion in boys but not girls but no increased risk for osteopenia. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple oral corticosteroid bursts over a period of years can produce a dosage-dependent reduction in bone mineral accretion and increased risk for osteopenia in children with asthma. Inhaled corticosteroid use has the potential for reducing bone mineral accretion in male children progressing through puberty, but this risk is likely to be outweighed by the ability to reduce the amount of oral corticosteroids used in these children.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the beta2-adrenergic receptor gene and asthma and wheeze have been inconsistent. Recent studies indicated that tobacco smoke affects beta2-adrenergic receptor gene expression and associations of beta2-adrenergic receptor gene variants with asthma in adults. We aimed to investigate the joint effects of in utero and childhood secondhand tobacco smoke exposure and 2 well-characterized functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (Arg16Gly and Glu27Gln) of beta2-adrenergic receptor gene on asthma and wheezing in 3128 non-Hispanic and Hispanic white children of the Children's Health Study. METHODS: We fitted logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the independent and joint effects of these single-nucleotide polymorphisms and in utero and secondhand tobacco smoke exposure on asthma and wheeze outcomes. RESULTS: Exposures to in utero maternal smoking and secondhand tobacco smoke were associated with wheezing. Children who were homozygous for the Arg16 allele and were exposed to maternal smoking in utero were at a threefold increased risk for lifetime wheeze compared with children who were unexposed and had at least 1 Gly16 allele. We found similar joint effects of secondhand tobacco smoke and Arg16Gly with wheezing. The risk for lifetime, current, and nocturnal wheeze increased with the number of smokers at home among Arg16 homozygous children. The results were consistent in 2 cohorts of children recruited in 1993 and 1996. Diplotype-based analyses were consistent with the single-nucleotide polymorphism-specific results. No associations were found for Glu27Gln. CONCLUSIONS: Both in utero and childhood exposure to tobacco smoke were associated with an increased risk for wheeze in children, and the risks were greater for children with the Arg16Arg genotype or 2 copies of the Arg16-Gln27 diplotype. Exposures to smoking need to be taken into account when evaluating the effects of beta2-adrenergic receptor gene variants on respiratory health outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about factors associated with progression of childhood asthma from onset of symptoms to index date determined by medical records. OBJECTIVE: To determine the duration between the onset of asthma symptoms to index date of asthma (ie, time when one met the criteria for asthma) and associated factors. METHODS: Study participants came from a sample of 839 healthy children, aged 5 to 12 years, who had participated in a previous study. Comprehensive medical record reviews were conducted to determine first documentation of asthma symptoms and index date of asthma. Factors were evaluated for an association with the duration from onset of asthma symptoms to index date of asthma. RESULTS: Of the study sample, 222 children met the criteria for asthma and had an available onset date of asthma symptoms. The median ages at onset of asthma symptoms and the index date were 5.6 and 7.6 years, respectively. The median duration between onset of asthma symptoms and index date was 2.9 months, and the mean was 17.2 months. There was a tendency for patients with a pet at home (P = .047), exercise-induced symptoms (P = .04), younger age at symptom onset (P = .05), and more severe asthma (P = .05) to have a shorter duration from onset of symptoms to index date. CONCLUSIONS: The duration from onset of asthma symptoms to index date of asthma varies significantly depending on host and environmental factors. It does not necessarily correlate with commonly recognized risk factors for incidence or severity of asthma.

AB  - Background: Extra-fine hydrofluoroalkane-beclomethasone differs from other inhaled corticosteroids by its fine aerosol characteristics. Therefore, extra-fine hydrofluoroalkane-beclomethasone may be particularly useful for treating peripheral airway inflammation in asthma.Objective: To analyze the anti-inflammatory effects of extra-fine hydrofluoroalkane-beclomethasone vs fluticasone dry powder inhaler (DPI) in asthmatic children by measuring bronchial and alveolar nitric oxide (NO) and inflammatory markers in exhaled breath condensate (EBC).Methods: In a 6-month crossover study, 33 children aged 6 to 12 years with moderate persistent asthma were randomly treated with extra-fine hydrofluoroalkane-beclomethasone (200 microg daily via an Autohaler) and fluticasone DPI (200 microg daily via a Diskus). The primary outcome variables were alveolar NO concentration and bronchial NO flux. The secondary outcome variables were levels of inflammatory markers in EBC, lung function indices, symptoms, exacerbations, and adverse effects. All the variables were recorded at baseline and after each treatment period.Results: Mean +/- SE alveolar NO concentration and bronchial NO flux were comparable after treatment with hydrofluoroalkane-beclomethasone vs fluticasone DPI (4.7 +/- 0.5 vs 4.3 +/- 0.5 ppb, P = .55, and 1,124.3 +/- 253.6 vs 1,029.1 +/- 195.5 pL/s, P = .70, respectively). In addition, levels of inflammatory markers in EBC, lung function indices, and symptoms did not differ between treatments. Patients used fewer beta2-agonists during the last 2 weeks of hydrofluoroalkane-beclomethasone treatment.Conclusion: The anti-inflammatory effects of hydrofluoroalkane-beclomethasone are similar to those of fluticasone DPI in children with moderate persistent asthma.

AB  - Background: Secondhand smoke triggers childhood asthma. Understanding sources of exposure, parental beliefs about exposure, and readiness to change that exposure are important for designing smoke exposure reduction interventions.Methods: As part of screening for a clinical trial of a smoke exposure reduction intervention, 519 smoke-exposed children 3 to 12 years old with asthma provided urine specimens for cotinine testing, and their primary caregivers completed questionnaires.Results: The urine cotinine to creatinine ratio (CCR) was lowest if neither the primary caregiver nor day-care provider smoked (mean CCR, 14.0; SD, 14.4), greater if either smoked (mean CCR, 22.2; SD, 21.3; and mean, CCR, 26.3; SD, 22.2, respectively), and greatest if both smoked (mean CCR, 39.6; SD, 27.5; p < 0.01). Parental perception of their child's exposure was weakly associated with the child's CCR (r(2) = 0.11, p < 0.001). Most parents (58.3%) reported that tobacco smoke exposure had small/no negative effect on their child's asthma. Substantial proportions of those for whom a specific exposure reduction action was relevant were classified as contemplating, preparing, or had recently taken action to reduce their child's exposure, including smoking cessation (61.3%), keeping the child out of smoke-exposed places (72.7%), and making the child's home (49.2%) and areas out of the home smoke free (66.9%).Conclusions: Smoking by the primary caregiver and day-care provider are important sources of exposure for children with asthma. Parental assessment of their child's exposure is associated with biologically confirmed exposure but cannot be relied on to assess that exposure. Although the harm of smoke exposure was frequently underestimated, many parents appeared receptive to considering action to reduce their child's exposure.Trial Registration: (Clinicaltrials.gov). Identifier: NCT00217958.

AB  - Background: No quick and easy assessment tool is presently available to measure asthma control and outcome in Chinese children.Methods: We translated an established seven-item questionnaire into the Chinese Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-CACT) to measure asthma symptoms and their effect on daily function in 247 children aged 4-11 years enrolled from specialty clinics around Tainan. Subjects were classed as having either intermittent or persistent asthma and were evaluated at two outpatient visits 4-8 weeks apart (baseline and follow-up).Results: C-CACT at baseline correlated significantly with physician evaluation scores (PES) except in predicted peak expiratory flow rate. There were significant differences for mean C-CACT score and mean PES between the intermittent group and persistent group. Internal consistency reliability of the survey was 0.741 at baseline and 0.759 at the follow-up visit. Test-retest reliability among 209 patients with the same specialist rating of asthma control at baseline and follow-up was r = 0.546 (P < 0.001). C-CACT scores of patients whose therapy needed to be stepped up was significantly lower than in those with unchanged or stepped-down therapy (F = 39.61, P < 0.001).Conclusions: C-CACT provides a reliable, valid, and responsive measure of asthma control in Chinese children.

AB  - Rationale: The basis for gender influences on allergen-specific IgEs is unclear.Objectives: To perform regular and sex-stratified genomewide linkage analyses of IgE to each of three allergens (Ascaris lumbricoides, Blatella germanica [German cockroach]), and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus [dust mite]) and to conduct an association study of a candidate gene in a linked genomic region.Methods: Genomewide linkage analyses of allergen-specific IgEs were conducted in 653 members of eight large families of Costa Rican children with asthma. An analysis of the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms in thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and IgE measurements was conducted in 417 parent-child trios in Costa Rica. Significant results were replicated in 470 families of white children in the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP).Measurements and Main Results: Among all subjects, there was suggestive evidence of linkage (LOD >/= 2.72) to IgE to Ascaris (on chromosome 7q) and IgE to dust mite (on chromosomes 7p and 12q). In a sex-stratified analysis, there was significant evidence of linkage to IgE to cockroach on chromosome 5q23 (peak LOD, 4.14 at 127 cM) in female subjects. TSLP is located within the 1.5 LOD-unit support interval for this linkage peak and has female-specific effects on lung disease in mice. In a sex-stratified analysis, the T allele of single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2289276 in TSLP was associated with reductions in IgE to cockroach (in Costa Rican girls) and total IgE (in girls in Costa Rica and in CAMP; P value for sex-by-genotype interaction, <0.01 in both studies).Conclusions: Consistent with findings in murine models, a variant in TSLP may have female-specific effects on allergic phenotypes.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association among birth weight, prematurity, and the prevalence of asthma later in childhood and to assess the degree to which this association may differ between black and white children. METHODS: Michigan Medicaid claims data from 2001 through 2003 were analyzed to determine asthma prevalence for 150,204 children between ages 5 and 18 years. Asthma cases were identified using Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set persistent asthma criteria and included children having claims for any of the following services within a calendar year: at least one inpatient or one emergency department (ED) claim with an asthma primary diagnosis; at least four asthma medication-dispensing events; or at least four outpatient visits with an asthma diagnosis, and at least two asthma medication-dispensing events. Birth weight and gestational age from birth certificate data were matched with Medicaid files to determine size-for-gestational-age criteria. RESULTS: Overall, 8.3% of children had persistent asthma; black children had slightly higher asthma prevalence (8.6%) than white children (7.8%; odds ratio [OR] = 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-1.15). Children born very preterm (</=32 weeks) had higher prevalence of childhood asthma (11.7%) compared with term births (8.0%; OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.40-1.63). However, no significant differences were observed in odds of asthma between black and white children born very preterm, preterm (33-36 weeks), or small for gestational age (SGA). CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of race, children born very preterm had an increased risk of childhood asthma. Although overall asthma prevalence is higher among black children enrolled in Medicaid compared with their white counterparts, these differences were attenuated when prematurity or SGA status were taken into account.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare clinical practice guideline (CPG) recommendations and reported physician management of acute paediatric asthma in the 11 largest paediatric emergency departments, all of which have CPGs, in Australia (n = 9) and New Zealand (n = 2). All 11 sites participate in the Paediatric Research in Emergency Departments International Collaborative (PREDICT) research network. METHODS: (a) A review of CPGs for acute childhood asthma from all PREDICT sites. (b) A standardised anonymous survey of senior emergency doctors at PREDICT sites investigating management of acute childhood asthma. RESULTS: CPGs for mild to moderate asthma were similar across sites and based on salbutamol delivery by metered dose inhaler with spacer and oral prednisolone. In severe to critical asthma, differences between sites were common and related to recommendations for: ipratropium use; metered-dose inhaler versus nebulised delivery of salbutamol in severe asthma; use of intravenous aminophylline, intravenous magnesium and dosing of intravenous salbutamol in critical asthma. The questionnaire (78 of 83 doctors responded) also revealed significant differences between doctors in the treatment of moderate to severe asthma. Ipratropium was used for moderate asthma by 42%. For severe to critical asthma, nebulised delivery of salbutamol was preferred by 79% of doctors over metered dose inhalers. For critical asthma, doctors reported using intravenous aminophylline in 45%, intravenous magnesium in 55%, and intravenous salbutamol in 87% of cases. Thirty-nine different dosing regimens for intravenous salbutamol were reported. CONCLUSIONS: CPG recommendations and reported physician practice for mild to moderate paediatric asthma management were broadly similar across PREDICT sites and consistent with national guidelines. Practice was highly variable for severe to critical asthma and probably reflects limitations of available evidence. Areas of controversy, in particular the comparative efficacy of intravenous bronchodilators, would benefit from multi-centre trials. Collaborative development of CPGs should be considered.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this article is to review the recently published studies addressing various treatment approaches for asthma in preschool children. RECENT FINDINGS: The heterogeneity of wheezing in the preschool years complicates the study of asthma in this age group. Once children at highest risk for persistence of wheezing are identified, various management strategies may be thoroughly studied. Several recent studies have confirmed the efficacy and safety of both inhaled corticosteroids and leukotriene receptor antagonists in the management of early childhood asthma. In addition to examining clinical efficacy, studies investigating the effects of these treatment modalities on the underlying airway inflammation have recently increased in number and quality and confirm the anti-inflammatory actions of these therapeutic strategies in the preschool child with asthma. SUMMARY: Evidence for the preferred treatment strategies for persistent asthma in young children remains incomplete. Based on the current body of evidence, there is rationale for further investigation of these management strategies, including direct comparisons between inhaled corticosteroids and leukotriene receptor antagonists, as well as the role of long-acting beta-agonists, potentially targeting the subpopulations of early childhood with wheezing who are at highest risk for persistence of asthma symptoms.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review describes recent studies in children that evaluated long-term outcomes of controller asthma medications. RECENT FINDINGS: The literature is replete with studies demonstrating the immediate profound effects of inhaled corticosteroids on symptom control, reduction in morbidity and mortality rates, improvement in lung function, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and inflammatory markers. Recent evidence supports that even this most effective class of medication does not alter the progression of recurrent wheeze to asthma, and that its effects on decline in lung function are limited. The lack of evidence supporting the superiority of lower dose inhaled corticosteroids combined with a long-acting beta-agonist over a full dose inhaled corticosteroid with respect to long-term efficacy measures and growth effects suggests that monotherapy with acceptable inhaled corticosteroid dose is the preferred treatment in children with mild to moderate persistent asthma. Montelukast has been shown to significantly reduce asthma exacerbations and lower use of supplemental inhaled corticosteroids compared with placebo. SUMMARY: There is mounting evidence that the currently available medications for childhood asthma have a substantial impact on multiple dimensions of asthma control. No drug in our current armamentarium, however, has been found to alter the natural progression of childhood asthma nor halt progressive airway damage in the more susceptible children.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Although great improvement has been obtained in quality of life and mastering of illness by asthmatic children over recent decades, controversies still exist related to asthma treatment. The objective of the present article is to discuss such controversies. RECENT FINDINGS: Results from recent publications related to childhood asthma treatment question existing dogmas. Important for prescribing correct treatment to children is correct diagnosis. Phenotypes of childhood asthma related to treatment decisions are discussed. Early use of inhaled steroids in young children is still debated as well as the preference of inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists versus leukotriene receptor antagonists as add on to inhaled steroids. When present, both allergic rhinitis and asthma should be treated to obtain improved control. Also as regards the treatment of exercise-induced asthma in children, new results concerning use of leukotriene receptor antagonists is discussed as well as the acute treatment in infants with bronchial obstruction. SUMMARY: There are still several controversies regarding treatment of the asthmatic child. New studies designed specifically for children are needed to solve these questions. One cannot rely on studies performed in adults for treatment in children. New studies designed for childhood asthma are needed to solve these controversies.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this article is to examine the evidence for the effectiveness of a written action plan as an important element of guided self-management and to identify key features associated with its effectiveness in children and adolescents. RECENT FINDINGS: Various written action plans are available for use; however, few have been specifically designed or validated for children. Strong, but limited pediatric evidence confirms that the addition of a written action plan to guided self-management education significantly improves outcome. Use of daily controller medication, with no step-up therapy other than as needed inhaled beta2-agonist, best prevents asthma exacerbations. Symptom-based appear superior to peak-flow based written action plans. The paucity of pediatric trials does not permit the identification of other keys features that enhance the dispensing of written action plans by healthcare professionals or uptake of recommendations by children, adolescents and their parents. SUMMARY: Written action plans are effective tools to facilitate self-management. While step-up therapy is not superior to daily controller medication, symptom-based are superior to peak-flow based action plans for preventing exacerbations, other keys features associated with effectiveness have yet to be identified.

AB  - Objective: Black and Latino children with asthma have worse morbidity and receive less controller medication than their white peers. Scant information exists on racial/ethnic differences in parent perceptions of asthma. To compare parent perceptions among black, Latino, and white children with asthma in 4 domains: (1) expectations for functioning with asthma; (2) concerns about medications; (3) interactions with providers; and (4) competing family priorities.Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we conducted telephone interviews with parents of children with persistent asthma in a Medicaid health plan and a multispecialty provider group in Massachusetts. To measure expectations for functioning and other domains, we adapted multi-item scales from past studies. Associations between race/ethnicity and these domains were evaluated in multivariate analyses that controlled for age, gender, household income, parental education, insurance, and language. The response rate was 72%.Results: Of the 739 study children, 24% were black, 21% Latino, and 43% white. Parents of black and Latino children had lower expectations for their children's functioning with asthma (P < .001), higher levels of worry about their children's asthma (P < .001), and more competing family priorities (P = .004) compared with parents of white children. Parents of Latino children had higher levels of concern about medications for asthma than parents of black or white children (P = .002). There were no differences among racial/ethnic groups in reports of interactions with the provider of their children's asthma care.Conclusion: Efforts to eliminate disparities in childhood asthma may need to address variation in expectations and competing priorities between minority and white families.

AB  - Objective: To describe the clinical management of 10 cases of childhood asthma using a conservative, multi-modal treatment approach based on applied kinesiology (AK) chiropractic methods. Clinical Features: Ten patients are presented (7 male, 3 female) between the ages of 3 and 22. Each patient had been medically diagnosed and treated for asthma, and all patients were taking one or more asthma medications. Intervention and Outcome: After physical, orthopaedic and AK manual muscle testing examination, the patients were admitted to a multi-modal treatment protocol including chiropractic manipulative therapy, cranial manipulative therapy, muscle therapies aimed at strengthening the muscles of respiration, and nutritional evaluation using the methods developed in applied kinesiology chiropractic. Outcome measures for the study included subjective/objective visual analogue respiratory impairment scales (VAS), improvement in exercise-induced asthma symptoms, reduction of respiratory distress with daily activity, reduction in the frequency of coughing during the day and night, and ease of breathing. These assessments were gathered from both the children and their parents or guardians. Additionally, each patient was able to go off their asthma medications over a range of 3-6 visits (covering a range of 14 days to 5 months time) without a return of their asthma symptoms. All the patients remained off their medications during a follow-up period ranging from 3 months to 4 years. Conclusion: A percentage of patients presenting to chiropractors have asthma. This case series report suggests that a potential benefit may exist in asthma-associated symptoms for selected cases treated with this multi-modal chiropractic protocol.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) plays a role in a spectrum of respiratory diseases; however, the effects of sequence variation across the entire locus in asthma pathogenesis have yet to be determined. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to investigate whether sequence variations in the GSTP1 coding and promoter regions are associated with asthma and wheezing outcomes and to determine whether variants affect susceptibility to maternal smoking. METHODS: Four haplotype tagging SNPs were selected that accounted for 83% of the common haplotypic variation in GSTP1. The associations of GSTP1 variants with asthma and wheezing were assessed among white children in the Children's Health Study (CHS). RESULTS: The Ile105Val allele and a SNP in the upstream promoter region (SNP1: rs6591255, putative transcription factor 1 binding site) were associated with asthma and wheezing outcomes, an association observed in two cohorts of the CHS recruited in different years. Haplotypes that included both the promoter SNP (i.e., rs6591255) and the 105 Val variant were associated with an increased risk for asthma in non-Hispanic whites. Using SNP- and haplotype-based approaches, the effect of maternal smoking on wheezing was largest in children with the Ile105Val allele. CONCLUSIONS: Variants in both the promoter and coding regions of the GSTP1 locus may contribute to the occurrence of childhood asthma and wheezing and may increase susceptibility to adverse effects of tobacco-smoke exposure.

AB  - The objective of this article was to investigate the relationship between serum leptin concentration and airway inflammation in preschool children with asthma, the individual serum leptin concentration, obesity index, and respiratory function, including bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), were investigated. The relationship between the serum leptin concentration and the obesity index was determined in 103 healthy preschool children aged 6 as controls. For the BHR investigation, the serum leptin concentration in 57 preschool children aged 6 (33 with asthma and 24 wheezers) was determined. These children then underwent lung function tests using methacholine inhalation challenge by the oscillation method. The BHR was also measured in 15 of the 103 controls subjects. In the control group, serum leptin concentration was significantly correlated to the obesity index. There was no statistical difference in both serum leptin concentration and the obesity index among the asthma patients, the wheezers and the control group. Although there was no significant association between serum leptin concentration and lung function parameters (FVC, FEV1, and V'50), a significant association was observed between the serum leptin concentration and BHR (p < 0.038), and between obesity index and BHR (p = 0.015). The serum IL-6 concentration was not related with the serum leptin concentration and BHR. These results suggest that serum leptin has no effect on lung functional parameters but does affect the BHR, and that the relationship between leptin and airway inflammation may contribute to the severity of childhood asthma at 6 years of age.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Family structure is known to influence children's behavioral, educational, and cognitive outcomes, and recent studies suggest that family structure affects children's access to health care as well. However, no study has addressed whether family structure is associated with the care children receive for particular conditions or with their physical health outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of family structure on the treatment and outcomes of children with asthma. METHODS: Our data sources were the 1996-2003 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and the 2003 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH). The study samples consisted of children 2-17 years of age with asthma who lived in single-mother or 2-parent families. We assessed the effect of number of parents and number of other children in the household on office visits for asthma and use of asthma medications using negative binomial regression, and we assessed the effect of family structure on the severity of asthma symptoms using binary and ordinal logistic regression. Our regression models adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, parental experience in child-rearing and in caring for an asthmatic child and, when appropriate, measures of children's health status. RESULTS: Asthmatic children in single-mother families had fewer office visits for asthma and filled fewer prescriptions for controller medications than children with 2 parents. In addition, children living in families with 3 or more other children had fewer office visits and filled fewer prescriptions for reliever and controller medications than children living with no other children. Children from single-mother families had more health difficulties from asthma than children with 2 parents, and children living with 2 or more other children were more likely to have an asthma attack in the past 12 months than children living with no other children. CONCLUSIONS: For children with asthma, living with a single mother and the presence of additional children in the household are associated with less treatment for asthma and worse asthma outcomes.

AB  - RATIONALE: Evidence is emerging that exposure to maternal distress in early life plays a causal role in the development of childhood asthma. OBJECTIVES: Because much of the data are from high-risk cohorts, we undertook a birth cohort study in a complete population of children to test this association. METHODS: Using Manitoba, Canada's, health care and prescription databases, this longitudinal study assessed the association between maternal distress during the first year of life and onward, and asthma at age 7 in a 1995 birth cohort of 13,907 children. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Maternal distress was defined on the basis of health care or prescription medication use for depression or anxiety. Asthma status was derived from health care and prescription records for asthma, using a definition validated by comparison to pediatric allergist diagnosis. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the likelihood of asthma (odds ratio [OR], 95% confidence interval [95% CI]). Independent of well-known asthma risk factors, our population-based study of a non-high-risk cohort demonstrated an increased risk of childhood asthma (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01-1.55) among children exposed to continued maternal distress from birth until age 7. Exposure to maternal depression and anxiety limited to the first year of life did not have a demonstrable association with subsequent asthma. Of interest, we observed that the risk of asthma associated with continued maternal distress was increased in children living in high- versus low-income households (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.12-1.85). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal distress in early life plays a role in the development of childhood asthma, especially if it continues beyond the postpartum period.

AB  - Background: There is a growing body of literature linking GIS-based measures of traffic density to asthma and other respiratory outcomes. However, no consensus exists on which traffic indicators best capture variability in different pollutants or within different settings. As part of a study on childhood asthma etiology, we examined variability in outdoor concentrations of multiple traffic-related air pollutants within urban communities, using a range of GIS-based predictors and land use regression techniques.Methods: We measured fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and elemental carbon (EC) outside 44 homes representing a range of traffic densities and neighborhoods across Boston, Massachusetts and nearby communities. Multiple three to four-day average samples were collected at each home during winters and summers from 2003 to 2005. Traffic indicators were derived using Massachusetts Highway Department data and direct traffic counts. Multivariate regression analyses were performed separately for each pollutant, using traffic indicators, land use, meteorology, site characteristics, and central site concentrations.Results: PM2.5 was strongly associated with the central site monitor (R2 = 0.68). Additional variability was explained by total roadway length within 100 m of the home, smoking or grilling near the monitor, and block-group population density (R2 = 0.76). EC showed greater spatial variability, especially during winter months, and was predicted by roadway length within 200 m of the home. The influence of traffic was greater under low wind speed conditions, and concentrations were lower during summer (R2 = 0.52). NO2 showed significant spatial variability, predicted by population density and roadway length within 50 m of the home, modified by site characteristics (obstruction), and with higher concentrations during summer (R2 = 0.56).Conclusion: Each pollutant examined displayed somewhat different spatial patterns within urban neighborhoods, and were differently related to local traffic and meteorology. Our results indicate a need for multi-pollutant exposure modeling to disentangle causal agents in epidemiological studies, and further investigation of site-specific and meteorological modification of the traffic-concentration relationship in urban neighborhoods.

AB  - Despite the increasing attention to the relationship between asthma and work exposures, occupational asthma remains underrecognized and its population burden underestimated. This may be due, in part, to the fact that traditional approaches to studying asthma in populations cannot adequately take into account the healthy worker effect (HWE). The HWE is the potential bias caused by the phenomenon that sicker individuals may choose work environments in which exposures are low; they may be excluded from being hired; or once hired, they may seek transfer to less exposed jobs or leave work. This article demonstrates that population- and workplace-based asthma studies are particularly subject to HWE bias, which leads to underestimates of relative risks. Our objective is to describe the HWE as it relates to asthma research, and to discuss the significance of taking HWE bias into account in designing and interpreting asthma studies. We also discuss the importance of understanding HWE bias for public health practitioners and for clinicians. Finally, we emphasize the timeliness of this review in light of the many longitudinal "child to young adult" asthma cohort studies currently underway. These prospective studies will soon provide an ideal opportunity to examine the impact of early workplace environments on asthma in young adults. We urge occupational and childhood asthma epidemiologists collaborate to ensure that this opportunity is not lost.

AB  - Background: Low levels of asthma control worldwide point to the possibility of sub-optimal management; therefore, documentation of physicians' perception is critical for future interventions. Our aim was to examine self-reported management abilities of Turkish physicians dealing with children with asthma, document the factors affecting appropriate decisions and compare the results with those of a previous survey. Methods: Physicians were surveyed via a questionnaire aimed to document self-perceived asthma knowledge and attitudes in asthma management. Results: The majority of physicians were male (63%) and examined 234 ± 9 patients per week. Infrequent use of objective parameters in asthma diagnosis and attack severity assessment was reported and most preferred nebulized corticosteroids to the systemic form in acute asthma. Even though self-perceived overall asthma knowledge did not differ between genders (p = 0.098), male physicians scored higher than females for inhaled steroids for acute asthma (2.8 ± 0.12 vs 2.17 ± 0.2, respectively, p = 0.007), while female physicians recorded more frequent use of inhaled steroids for chronic asthma (3.72 ± 0.08 vs 3.43 ± 0.07, respectively, p = 0.006). Female physicians' scoring for "symptom control" as the main aim of asthma management was higher than that of their male counterparts (3.88 ± 0.04 vs 3.65 ± 0.06, respectively, p = 0.002). Conclusion: Although there were some discrepancies between guidelines and clinical practice, most applications of Turkish physicians dealing with children with asthma were appropriate. Interestingly, when scores of female versus male physicians were compared, it can be suggested that female physicians have a more appropriate perception of asthma, indicating a significant contribution of gender-related factors in clinical attitudes and beliefs.

AB  - Sodium cromoglycate has been recommended as maintenance treatment for childhood asthma for many years. Its use has decreased since 1990, when inhaled corticosteroids became popular, but it is still used in many countries. To determine the efficacy of sodium cromoglycate compared to placebo in the prophylactic treatment of children with asthma. We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register (October 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2007), MEDLINE (January 1966 to November 2007), EMBASE (January 1985 to November 2007) and reference lists of articles. We also contacted the pharmaceutical company manufacturing sodium cromoglycate. In 2007 we updated the review. All double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trials, which addressed the effectiveness of inhaled sodium cromoglycate as maintenance therapy, studying children aged 0 up to 18 years with asthma. Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We pooled study results. Of 3500 titles retrieved from the literature, 24 papers reporting on 23 studies could be included in the review. The studies were published between 1970 and 1997 and together included 1026 participants. Most were cross-over studies. Few studies provided sufficient information to judge the concealment of allocation. Four studies provided results for the percentage of symptom-free days. Pooling the results did not reveal a statistically significant difference between sodium cromoglycate and placebo. For the other pooled outcomes, most of the symptom-related outcomes and bronchodilator use showed statistically significant results, but treatment effects were small. Considering the confidence intervals of the outcome measures, a clinically relevant effect of sodium cromoglycate cannot be excluded. The funnel plot showed an under-representation of small studies with negative results, suggesting publication bias. There is insufficient evidence to be sure about the efficacy of sodium cromoglycate over placebo. Publication bias is likely to have overestimated the beneficial effects of sodium cromoglycate as maintenance therapy in childhood asthma.[CINAHL Note: The Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews contain interactive software that allows various calculations in the MetaView.]

AB  - Considerable variation in the prevalence of childhood asthma and its symptoms (wheezing) has been observed in previous studies and there is evidence that the prevalence has been increasing over time.~Background~Background~We have systematically reviewed the reported prevalence and time trends of wheezing symptoms among children, worldwide and within the same country over time. All studies comprising more than 1000 persons and meeting certain other quality criteria published over a 16-year period, between January 1990 and December 2005, are reported and a comparison of ISAAC (International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood) and non-ISAAC studies is made, in part as a way of expanding the power to examine time trends (the older studies tend to be non-ISAAC), but also to examine possible methodological differences between ISAAC and non-ISAAC questions.~Methods~Methods~A wide range of current prevalence of wheeze was observed between and within countries over time. The UK had the highest recorded prevalence of 32.2% in children aged 13-14 in 1994-5 and Ethiopia had the lowest prevalence, 1.7% in children aged 10-19 in 1996. All studies in Australia and the UK were compared using multiple logistic regression. ISAAC phase I and III studies reported significantly higher prevalence of current wheeze (OR = 1.638) compared with non-ISAAC studies, after adjusting for various other factors (country, survey year, age of child, parental vs child response to the survey). Australia showed a significantly higher prevalence of current wheezing (OR = 1.343) compared with the UK, there was a significant increase in the prevalence odds ratio per survey year (2.5% per year), a significant decrease per age of child (0.7% per year), and a significantly higher response in current wheezing if the response was self-completed by the child (OR = 1.290). These factors, when explored separately for ISAAC and non-ISAAC studies, showed very different results. In ISAAC studies, or non-ISAAC studies using ISAAC questions, there was a significant decrease in current wheezing prevalence over time (2.5% per year). In non-ISAAC studies, which tend to cover an earlier period, there was a significant increase (2.6% per year) in current wheezing prevalence over time. This is very likely to be a result of prevalence of wheezing increasing from the 1970s up to the early 1990s, but decreasing since then.~Results~Results~The UK has the highest recorded prevalence of wheezing and Ethiopia the lowest. Prevalence of wheezing in Australia and the UK has increased from the 1970s up to the early 1990s, but decreased since then and ISAAC studies report significantly higher prevalences than non-ISAAC studies.~Conclusion~Conclusions

AB  - Aims. We present the case history of an eight-year-old girl with persistent moderate asthma due to repetitive bronchopneumonia episodes.Patient and methods. The patient was referred by the Pneumology Unit for respiratory physiotherapy at a private clinic, with the prioritary aim of rendering permeable her airways, which were obstructed by mucous plugs coursing with bronchopneumonia. An initial physiotherapeutic assessment was carried out according to the Spanish Guideline for the Management of Asthma; this was to be followed by a five-month respiratory physiotherapy programme with the objective of achieving successful control of her asthma.Results. The results show an improvement of her spirometric values, of the pulmonary auscultation, of the roentgenologic findings and of the physiotherapeutic anamnesis, and evident self-control of her asthma episodes.Conclusions. The institution of a respiratory physiotherapy programme in cases of childhood asthma improves lung function and the child's quality of life.[sic]

AB  - Background: Tobacco smoke and genetic susceptibility are risk factors for asthma and wheezing. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is a combined effect of interleukin-13 gene (IL13) polymorphisms and tobacco smoke on persistent childhood wheezing and asthma.Methods: In the Isle of Wight birth cohort (UK, 1989-1999), five IL13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): rs1800925 (-1112C/T), rs2066960, rs1295686, rs20541 (R130Q) and rs1295685 were genotyped. Parents were asked whether their children had wheezed in the last 12 months at ages 1, 2, 4 and 10 years. Children who reported wheeze in the first 4 years of life and also had wheezing at age 10 were classified as early-onset persistent wheeze phenotype; non-wheezers never wheezed up to age 10. Persistent asthma was defined as having a diagnosis of asthma both during the first four years of life and at age 10. Logistic regression methods were used to analyze data on 791 children with complete information. Potential confounders were gender, birth weight, duration of breast feeding, and household cat or dog present during pregnancy.Results: Maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with early-onset persistent wheeze (OR 2.93, p < 0.0001); polymorphisms in IL13 were not (OR 1.15, p = 0.60 for the common haplotype pair). However, the effect of maternal smoking during pregnancy was stronger in children with the common IL13 haplotype pair compared to those without it (OR 5.58 and OR 1.29, respectively; p for interaction = 0.014). Single SNP analysis revealed a similar statistical significance for rs20541 (p for interaction = 0.02). Comparable results were observed for persistent childhood asthma (p for interaction = 0.03).Conclusion: This is the first report that shows a combined effect of in utero exposure to smoking and IL13 on asthma phenotypes in childhood. The results emphasize that genetic studies need to take environmental exposures into account, since they may explain contradictory findings.

AB  - Rationale: Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 is involved in airway inflammation and remodeling, two key processes in asthma pathogenesis. Tobacco smoke and traffic emissions induce airway inflammation and modulate TGF-beta1 gene expression. We hypothesized that the effects of functional TGF-beta1 variants on asthma occurrence vary by these exposures.Objectives: We tested these hypotheses among 3,023 children who participated in the Children's Health Study.Methods: Tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs4803457 C>T and C-509T (a functional promoter polymorphism) accounted for 94% of the haplotype diversity of the upstream region. Exposure to maternal smoking in utero was based on smoking by biological mother during pregnancy. Residential distance from nearest freeway was calculated based on residential address at study entry.Measurements and Main Results: Children with the -509TT genotype had a 1.8-fold increased risk of early persistent asthma (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-2.95). This association varied marginally significantly by in utero exposure to maternal smoking. Compared with children with the -509CC/CT genotype with no in utero exposure to maternal smoking, those with the -509TT genotype with such exposure had a 3.4-fold increased risk of early persistent asthma (95% CI, 1.46-7.80; interaction, P = 0.11). The association between TGF-beta1 C-509T and lifetime asthma varied by residential proximity to freeways (interaction P = 0.02). Children with the -509TT genotype living within 500 m of a freeway had over three-fold increased lifetime asthma risk (95% CI, 1.29-7.44) compared with children with CC/CT genotype living > 1500 m from a freeway.Conclusions: Children with the TGF-beta1 -509TT genotype are at increased risk of asthma when they are exposed to maternal smoking in utero or to traffic-related emissions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 120 asthma camps presently serve nearly 10,000 children nationwide. A clinical profile of the children who attend asthma camps has not been published. OBJECTIVES: To create a standardized universal health history camp application that includes an assessment of health-related quality of life using the Child Asthma Short Form; to test a newly validated tool, the Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT), to assess asthma control in children; to provide a clinical snapshot of the overall status of children with asthma in the United States; and to determine the benefit of children's asthma camps. METHODS: Participating camps distributed the universal health history and the Child Asthma Short Form as part of their application. The C-ACT was distributed separately. RESULTS: A total of 1,783 campers from 24 camps in 17 states provided the requested information. Camp attendees generally had moderately severe asthma, as indicated by a mean +/- SD parent-reported severity rating of 4.86 +/- 2.10 on a 10-point scale. Average daytime and nighttime symptom scores and functional limitation scores indicated children moderately burdened by their asthma symptoms. Using the C-ACT, 37% of children were found to have inadequately controlled asthma. Children who had attended asthma camp the previous year reported better use of asthma management tools, were more likely to be using controller therapy, and had more responsibility for taking their medication (P < .05). CONCLUSION: The burden of asthma experienced by children attending asthma camps is substantial, suggesting that there is an opportunity to improve the lives of children attending asthma camps.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Children from Indian and Pakistani (South Asian) and black minority groups have relatively high rates of attendance at accident and emergency (A&E) departments and admissions to hospital in the UK. We examine parents' beliefs and management of childhood asthma that possibly contribute to their greater use of hospital services. DESIGN: Questionnaire survey. SETTING: Three London hospitals serving multicultural communities with a high proportion of South Asian subjects. PARTICIPANTS: Parent(s) accompanying 150 children aged 3-9 years with asthma attending asthma clinics and A&E departments. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: White, South Asian and 'other' ethnic group parents were compared regarding their children's symptoms and asthma in relation to why their children had developed asthma, use of asthma treatments, views about the prognosis of their children's asthma, and their feelings associated with stigma. RESULTS: South Asian more often than white parents stated that they did not give preventers to their children (odds ratio (OR) 0.30; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.75), that most drugs were 'addictive' (OR 3.89; 95% CI 1.47 to 10.27), and that medicines could do more harm than good (OR 3.19; 95% CI 1.22 to 8.34). South Asian and 'other' ethnic groups were more reluctant to tell others about their children's asthma (OR 0.11; 95% CI 0.01 to 1.06 and OR 0.06; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.65, respectively). CONCLUSION: Cultural perspectives related to ethnicity are key factors in the understanding of asthma management. Health staff should give high priority to eliciting parents' beliefs regarding management of their children's asthma.

The treatment begins with developing goals of therapy for a child by the health care provider, the family, and the child as a team. The primary objective is to reduce symptoms and exacerbations using therapies that include conventional medications, environmental controls, and lifestyle modification while reducing the potential for adverse effects of medications and the disease. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) may play a role in meeting these objectives, and through the integration of conventional and CAM therapies, an integrative medicine approach may facilitate reaching these objectives in a more effective manner.Copyright © 2007 by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spirometry, and in particular forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV(1)), are standard tools for objective evaluation of asthma. However, FEV(1) does not correlate with symptom scores, and hence its value in the assessment of childhood asthma may be limited. Therefore, some clinicians subjectively assess the presence of curvature in the maximum expiratory flow-volume (MEFV) curves obtained from spirometry, where concave patterns are observable despite normal FEV(1) values. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the usefulness of subjective and objective measures of the curvature in the descending phase of the MEFV curve for the assessment of asthma. METHODS: We obtained symptom scores and performed spirometry in 48 patients with asthma (21 females, mean +/- SD age 10.8 +/- 2.4 y). We measured FEV(1), the ratio of FEV(1) to forced vital capacity (FEV(1)/FVC), maximum expiratory flow at one quarter of the way, and at halfway, through the forced expiratory maneuver (MEF(25) and MEF(50), respectively), and maximum expiratory flow in the middle half of the forced expiratory maneuver (MEF(25-75)). Expiratory obstruction was ranked independently by 3 pediatric pulmonologists, by subjective assessment of the MEFV curve. In addition, the curvature of the descending limb of the MEFV curve was quantitatively estimated by introducing an 'average curvature index.' RESULTS: No significant correlations were found between FEV(1), MEF(50), MEF(25), and MEF(25-75,) respectively, and symptom score (r = -0.22, p = 0.14; r = -0.23, p = 0.11; r = -0.28, p = 0.057; r = -0.27, p = 0.06). A weak correlation was found for FEV(1)/FVC and symptom score (r = -0.33, p = 0.021). However, quantitatively determined average curvature index (ACI) correlated significantly better with measured symptom scores (r = 0.53, p < 0.001) and were in good agreement with the assessment of expiratory obstruction from subjective curvature assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Our general findings show that individual lung function variables do not correlate well with symptoms, whereas subjective curvature assessment is thought to be helpful. With the average curvature index we have illustrated a potential clinical usefulness of quantifying the curvatures of MEFV curves.

AB  - Rationale: Replication of gene-disease associations has become a requirement in complex trait genetics.Objectives: In studies of childhood asthma from two different ethnic groups, we attempted to replicate associations with five potential asthma susceptibility genes previously identified by positional cloning.Methods: We analyzed two family-based samples ascertained through an asthmatic proband: 497 European-American children from the Childhood Asthma Management Program and 439 Hispanic children from the Central Valley of Costa Rica. We genotyped 98 linkage disequilibrium-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in five genes: ADAM33, DPP10, GPR154 (HUGO name: NPSR1), HLA-G, and the PHF11 locus (includes genes SETDB2 and RCBTB1). SNPs were tested for association with asthma and two intermediate phenotypes: airway hyperresponsiveness and total serum immunoglobulin E levels.Measurements and Main Results: Despite differing ancestries, linkage disequilibrium patterns were similar in both cohorts. Of the five evaluated genes, SNP-level replication was found only for GPR154 (NPSR1). In this gene, three SNPs were associated with asthma in both cohorts, although the opposite alleles were associated in either study. Weak evidence for locus-level replication with asthma was found in the PHF11 locus, although there was no overlap in the associated SNP across the two cohorts. No consistent associations were observed for the three other genes.Conclusions: These results provide some further support for the role of genetic variation in GPR154 (NPSR1) and PHF11 in asthma susceptibility and also highlight the challenges of replicating genetic associations in complex traits such as asthma, even for genes identified by linkage analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence for environmental causes of asthma is limited, especially among African Americans. To look for systematic differences in early life domestic exposures between inner-city preschool children with and without asthma, we performed a study of home indoor air pollutants and allergens. METHODS: Children 2-6 years of age were enrolled in a cohort study in East Baltimore, Maryland. From the child's bedroom, air was monitored for 3 days for particulate matter <or= 2.5 and <or= 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM(2.5), PM(10)), nitrogen dioxide, and ozone. Median baseline values were compared for children with (n = 150) and without (n = 150) asthma. Housing characteristics related to indoor air pollution were assessed by caregiver report and home inspection. In addition, indoor allergen levels were measured in settled dust. RESULTS: Children were 58% male, 91% African American, and 88% with public health insurance. Housing characteristics related to pollutant exposure and bedroom air pollutant concentrations did not differ significantly between asthmatic and control subjects [median: PM(2.5), 28.7 vs. 28.5 microg/m(3); PM(10), 43.6 vs. 41.4 microg/m(3); NO(2), 21.6 vs. 20.9 ppb; O(3), 1.4 vs. 1.8 ppb; all p > 0.05]. Settled dust allergen levels (cat, dust mite, cockroach, dog, and mouse) were also similar in bedrooms of asthmatic and control children. CONCLUSIONS: Exposures to common home indoor pollutants and allergens are similar for inner-city preschool children with and without asthma. Although these exposures may exacerbate existing asthma, this study does not support a causative role of these factors for risk of developing childhood asthma.

AB  - Dietary factors, such as intake of fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, and probiotics, appear to influence the development of asthma and other allergic disease. The results of recent studies indicate that a higher maternal intake of vitamin D during pregnancy is associated with a lower risk of childhood asthma. However, vitamin D intake among children does not appear to reduce the risk of wheezing in early childhood. Maternal intake of probiotics during pregnancy also appears to have a protective effect against some allergies. For example, supplementation with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG is associated with a reduced risk of atopic eczema in children. There is no current evidence that probiotic supplementation prevents asthma.

AB  - Spatial variation in childhood asthma and a recent increase in prevalence indicate that environmental factors play a significant role in the etiology of this important disease. Socioeconomic position (SEP) has been associated inversely and positively with childhood asthma. These contradictory results indicate a need for systematic research about SEP and asthma. Pathways have been suggested for effects of SEP on asthma at both the individual and community level. We examined the relationship of prevalent asthma to community-level indicators of SEP among 5762 children in 12 Southern California communities, using a multilevel random effects model. Estimates of community-level SEP were derived by summarizing census block group-level data using a novel method of weighting by the proportion of the block groups included in a community-specific bounding rectangle that contained 95% of local study subjects. Community characteristics included measures of male unemployment, household income, low education (i.e., no high school diploma) and poverty. There was a consistent inverse association between male unemployment and asthma across the inter-quartile range of community unemployment rates, indicating that asthma rates increase as community SEP increases. The results were robust to individual-level confounding, methods for summarizing census block group data to the community level, scale of analysis (i.e., community-level vs. neighborhood-level) and the modeling algorithm. The positive association between SEP and prevalent childhood asthma might be explained by differential access to medical care that remains unmeasured, by the hygiene hypothesis (e.g., lower SES may associate with higher protective exposures to endotoxin in early life), or by SEP acting as a proxy for unmeasured neighborhood characteristics.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Studies have identified associations between household secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) exposure and induction of childhood asthma. However, the true nature and strength of this association remains confounded in many studies, producing inconsistent evidence. To look for sources of potential bias and try to uncover consistent patterns of relative risk estimates (RRs), we conducted a meta-analysis of studies published between 1970 and 2005. DATA SOURCES: Through an extensive literature search, we identified 38 epidemiologic studies of SHS exposure and the development of childhood asthma (that also controlled for atopy history) from 300 potentially relevant articles. DATA SYNTHESIS: We observed substantial heterogeneity within initial summary RRs of 1.48 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.32-1.65], 1.25 (1.21-1.30), and 1.21 (1.08-1.36), for ever, current, and incident asthma, respectively. Lack of control for type of atopy history (familial or child) and child's own smoking status within studies and age category altered summary RRs in separate meta-regressions. After adjusting for these confounding characteristics, consistent patterns of association emerged between SHS exposure and childhood asthma induction. Our summary RR of 1.33 (95% CI, 1.14-1.56) from studies of incident asthma among older children (6-18 years of age) is 1.27 times the estimate from studies of younger children and higher than estimates reported in earlier meta-analyses. CONCLUSIONS: This new finding indicates that exposure duration may be a more important factor in the induction of asthma than previously understood, and suggests that SHS could be a more fundamental and widespread cause of childhood asthma than some previous meta-analyses have indicated.

AB  - Although additional studies are needed to clarify the impact of diet on asthma and allergy, some patterns have emerged. For example, there is evidence that a diet high in omega-6 fatty acids (found in margarine, for example) is associated with increased risk of childhood atopy and asthma. In contrast, consumption of omega-3 fatty acids (found in fresh oily fish) appears to have a protective effect. There also is evidence that consumption of antioxidant nutrients, including vitamin E, vitamin C, zinc, and selenium, is associated with reduced risk of asthma. Maternal intake of vitamin E during pregnancy may reduce the risk of childhood asthma. Maternal intake of oily fish (not fish sticks) also may help protect children from asthma, especially when the mother has a history of asthma.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Development of asthma in children is influenced by interactions between genetic and environmental factors. It is unclear whether paternal or maternal histories of disease confer different risks. Previous population-based studies have not stratified analyses by child gender and sensitization status. Our aim was to study in detail the hereditary component of childhood asthma. METHODS: A population-based cohort of 3430 (97% of invited) 7- to 8-year-old school children participated in an expanded International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood survey, and two thirds were skin-prick tested. Heredity was defined as a family history of (1) asthma and (2) atopy (allergic rhinitis or eczema). Multivariate analyses corrected for known risk factors for asthma. RESULTS: At ages 7 to 8, prevalence of asthma was 5.3% among the children and 9.0% among the parents. In children without parental asthma or parental atopy, the prevalence of asthma was 2.8%. Corrected for parental asthma, parental atopy was a weak but significant risk factor. There were minor differences in the impact of parental disease between sensitized and nonsensitized children and between boys and girls. CONCLUSIONS: As risk factors for childhood asthma, there were major differences between parental asthma and parental atopy. Sibling asthma was only a marker of parental disease. Interactions between parental disease and the child's allergic sensitization or gender were not statistically significant. Asthma in both parents conferred a multiplicative risk, whereas the effect of parental atopy was additive, however limited. Asthma and atopy, despite their causal relationship, are separate entities and could be inherited differently. This large, population-based, and well-characterized cohort study does not confirm parent-of-origin effects found in previous studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this work was to determine whether overweight in youth with mild-to-moderate asthma occurs with increased frequency and is accompanied by impaired psychological functioning. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The interrelationships among BMI and demographic and psychological characteristics were examined in 1005 children (aged 5-12 years) enrolled in the Childhood Asthma Management Program and seen for repeated visits over 4 1/2 years. RESULTS: Baseline rates of overweight (BMI for age: > or = 95th percentile) were comparable, but rates of overweight risk (BMI for age: 85th to < 95th percentile) among children in the Childhood Asthma Management Program were elevated in comparison with the general population of children in the United States. Rates of overweight and overweight risk did not increase over the course of the longitudinal study. Overweight and overweight risk were more frequent among black and Hispanic than white children, although they were not higher relative to same-race groups in the general population. Overweight at baseline was associated with lower IQ, more social withdrawal, and greater internalized psychological distress. As the children became older, the overweight group demonstrated increased evidence of behavior problems and decreased physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies an increase in overweight risk but not overweight in children with mild-to-moderate asthma. Comorbidity between asthma and overweight may be underestimated, because children with severe asthma and those from impoverished backgrounds were not represented in this sample. For the 14% of children who were overweight, some associated psychological difficulties were present in childhood, and additional problems were seen during adolescence. These results suggest a need for programs that encourage greater vigilance and intervention for overweight children with asthma.

AB  - Rationale: Atopic sensitization has long been known to be related to asthma in children, but its role in determining asthma prevalence remains to be elucidated further. Objectives: To investigate the role of atopic sensitization in the large international variation in the prevalence of childhood asthma. Methods: Cross-sectional studies of random samples of 8- to 12-year-old children (n = 1,000 per center) were performed according to the standardized methodology of Phase Two of the International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood (ISAAC). Thirty study centers in 22 countries worldwide participated and reflect a wide range of living conditions, from rural Africa to urban Europe. Data were collected by parental questionnaires (n = 54,439), skin prick tests (n = 31,759), and measurements of allergen-specific IgE levels in serum (n = 8,951). Economic development was assessed by gross national income per capita (GNI). Measurements and Main Results: The prevalence of current wheeze (i.e., during the past year) ranged from 0.8% in Pichincha (Ecuador) to 25.6% in Uruguaiana (Brazil). The fraction of current wheeze attributable to atopic sensitization ranged from 0% in Ankara (Turkey) to 93.8% in Guangzhou (China). There were no correlations between prevalence rates of current wheeze and atopic sensitization, and only weak correlations of both with GNI. However, the fractions and prevalence rates of wheeze attributable to skin test reactivity correlated strongly with GNI (Spearman rank-order coefficient rho = 0.50, P = 0.006, and rho = 0.74, P < 0.0001, respectively). In addition, the strength of the association between current wheeze and skin test reactivity, assessed by odds ratios, increased with GNI (rho = 0.47, P = 0.01). Conclusions: The link between atopic sensitization and asthma symptoms in children differs strongly between populations and increases with economic development.

AB  - Background: Until recently, airway remodeling has been considered to be a secondary phenomenon, developing later in the disease process as a consequence of persistent inflammation. The presence of airway inflammation and remodeling in children with asthma indicate that the remodeling process begins early in the disease process of asthma and occurs synchronously in ongoing and repeated airway inflammation rather than as a consequence of airway inflammation. Bronchial epithelial cell damage also occurs early in the course of childhood asthma, and injured and stressed epithelial cells trigger airway remodeling through activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal tropic unit. Therefore, the characteristic features of bronchial epithelial cells in asthmatics should be clarified. Early intervention with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) before serious pathological changes occur, is expected to prevent the development of remodeling and improve asthma outcomes. Methods/Data base: A review of the current research and ideas regarding the mechanisms and assessment of airway inflammation and remodeling, as well as the effects of current and potential future therapeutics on airway remodeling, with a focus on bronchial epithelial cells. Results/Conclusions: Early intervention with ICS improves asthma-related symptoms and may partially prevent airway remodeling, however, the effects are not satisfactory. Therefore, therapeutic options, and how and when treatment can be effected should be investigated to reduce airway inflammation and prevent the development of airway remodeling.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Disproportionate life stress and consequent physiologic alteration (i.e., immune dysregulation) has been proposed as a major pathway linking socioeconomic position, environmental exposures, and health disparities. Asthma, for example, disproportionately affects lower-income urban communities, where air pollution and social stressors may be elevated. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine the role of exposure to violence (ETV), as a chronic stressor, in altering susceptibility to traffic-related air pollution in asthma etiology. METHODS: We developed geographic information systems (GIS)-based models to retrospectively estimate residential exposures to traffic-related pollution for 413 children in a community-based pregnancy cohort, recruited in East Boston, Massachusetts, between 1987 and 1993, using monthly nitrogen dioxide measurements for 13 sites over 18 years. We merged pollution estimates with questionnaire data on lifetime ETV and examined the effects of both on childhood asthma etiology. RESULTS: Correcting for potential confounders, we found an elevated risk of asthma with a 1-SD (4.3 ppb) increase in NO(2) exposure solely among children with above-median ETV [odds ratio (OR) = 1.63; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.14-2.33)]. Among children always living in the same community, with lesser exposure measurement error, this association was magnified (OR = 2.40; 95% CI, 1.48-3.88). Of multiple exposure periods, year-of-diagnosis NO(2) was most predictive of asthma outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: We found an association between traffic-related air pollution and asthma solely among urban children exposed to violence. Future studies should consider socially patterned susceptibility, common spatial distributions of social and physical environmental factors, and potential synergies among these. Prospective assessment of physical and social exposures may help determine causal pathways and critical exposure periods.

AB  - Medical Practitioners are often questioned regarding the prognosis of a child with asthma. We have performed a literature review of the natural history of childhood asthmatics. Factors which affect the natural history and prognosis of childhood asthma are discussed. Current evidence suggests that evolution of asthma severity is fairly predictable. Features of childhood asthma such as severity, duration, atopy, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and exposure to smoking can predict the course of asthma into adulthood. Most children with mild intermittent asthma will outgrow their asthma, or have mild episodic asthma. Early commencement of anti-inflammatory therapy, such as inhaled corticosteroids may prevent the progression of the disease. Most patients with mild asthma have good functional outcome and low healthcare utilisation.

AB  - Aims of the study. To present an overview of review management of childhood asthma in one UK primary care trust with respect to organization and perceptions of key stakeholders and children's and families' needs. Background. Review management of childhood asthma in primary care is important in addressing the continuing high levels of morbidity. However, the delivery of this service appears to be fragmented, so it is not known how well primary care asthma clinics function. Children's, parents' and professionals' perceptions of such clinics and the roles they play within them are also poorly understood. Research design.Aqualitative case study design was used in the study. This is a form of enquiry that investigates contemporary issues within their real life contexts, using particular situations within the case to describe important phenomena. Methods. Eighteen children, 16 parents, 14 practice purses and 14 general practitioners from 14 general practices in one primary care trust were interviewed. Review appointments were observed and asthma-related documentation examined. Findings. Key findings point to diversity in the service and that key stakeholders' view practice nurses as primarily responsible for the review management. However, there are issues related to their levels of responsibility, other health professionals' roles and interdisciplinary communication. Finally, families felt some of their needs were neglected and professionals reported uncertainties in providing family-centred care. Conclusions. This case study indicates that responsibility for review consultations in childhood asthma needs to be formalized, including a more proactive and familycentred approach. There are implications for the practice nurse role regarding professional education and preparation for family-centred care. Relevance to clinical practice. This paper shows that unstructured, diverse care delivery persists in primary care; children and their families identify both strengths and unmet needs in review management visits; and professionals have uncertainties about providing effective child and family-centred care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To address the major methodological issues of reverse causation and selection bias in epidemiologic studies of antibiotic use in early life and the development of asthma, we undertook a cohort study of this association in a complete population of children. METHODS: Using the health-care and prescription databases of Manitoba, Canada, this longitudinal study assessed the association between antibiotic prescription use during the first year of life and asthma at age 7 years in a 1995 birth cohort of 13,116 children. RESULTS: Independent of well-known asthma risk factors, asthma was significantly more likely to develop in children who had received antibiotics in the first year of life at age 7 years. The association with asthma was observed for antibiotic use in non-respiratory tract infections (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 3.37). The risk of asthma was highest in children receiving more than four courses of antibiotics (adjusted OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.88), especially among rural children, and in the absence of maternal asthma or a dog in the birth year. Broad-spectrum (BS) cephalosporin use was more common in these subpopulations of children. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic use in early life was associated with the development of childhood asthma, a risk that may be reduced by avoiding the use of BS cephalosporins.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the changes in the asthma phenotype as children progress from childhood into young adulthood. RECENT FINDINGS: Some children with asthma in the early school years improve symptomatically during adolescence and young adulthood, with less frequent remissions and increased relapse rates in those with severe symptoms. During remission of symptoms, lung function abnormalities, airway hyper-responsiveness, and airway inflammation often persist. New data from the Childhood Asthma Management Program cohort show progression of lung function abnormalities during adolescence. SUMMARY: Most children with persistent asthma have persistent disease as adults, and lung function abnormalities continue to progress as these children age.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To highlight studies that have contributed significantly to our current knowledge of inhaled glucocorticoids in childhood asthma. RECENT FINDINGS: In 2006, three important studies were published that investigated whether inhaled glucocorticoid therapy, if started soon after the onset of asthma symptoms, could alter the subsequent course of the disease. Several studies focused on the comparative clinical efficacy of inhaled glucocorticoids to leukotriene receptor antagonists in children with mild to moderate asthma. Although the Expert Panel had recommended inhaled glucocorticoid therapy as the preferred long-term controller with persistent asthma, there were no specific studies comparing these two classes of long-term controller medications in children. Another topic of significant clinical interest was the comparative efficacy of inhaled glucocorticoid to systemic glucocorticoids in the treatment of acute asthma. The question was answered in a study published in children with mild to moderate acute asthma. Lastly, the safety of inhaled glucocorticoid therapy was also evaluated in preschool children. SUMMARY: Inhaled glucocorticoids are the preferred long-term controller for initiating treatment of persistent asthma. Early intervention with inhaled glucocorticoids achieves symptom control but does not alter the natural history of asthma. Inhaled glucocorticoids are not as effective as systemic glucocorticoids for managing acute asthma exacerbations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Contaminants encountered in many households, such as environmental tobacco smoke, house dust mite, cockroach, cat and dog dander, and mold, are risk factors in asthma. Young children are a particularly vulnerable subpopulation for environmentally mediated asthma, and the economic burden associated with this disease is substantial. Certain mechanical interventions are effective both in reducing allergen loads in the home and in improving asthmatic children's respiratory health. RESULTS: Combinations of interventions including the use of dust mite-impermeable bedding covers, improved cleaning practices, high-efficiency particulate air vacuum cleaners, mechanical ventilation, and parental education are associated with both asthma trigger reduction and improved health outcomes for asthmatic children. Compared with valuated health benefits, these combinations of interventions have proven cost effective in studies that have employed them. Education alone has not proven effective in changing parental behaviors such as smoking in the home. CONCLUSIONS: Future research should focus on improving the effectiveness of education on home asthma triggers, and understanding long-term children's health effects of the interventions that have proven effective in reducing asthma triggers.

AB  - This is an open study of 81 cases of asthma in various paediatric age groups who received only homeopathic treatment for two years. The remedies were prescribed by individualising each case. The study showed that asthmatic attacks due to a variety of causes, like exercise, infection and allergy, could be treated successfully with homeopathy. Exacerbations and the use of nebulizers were reduced, and the asymptomatic period prolonged.

AB  - Rationale: Metabolomic analysis provides biochemical profiles of low-molecular-weight endogenous metabolites in biological fluids. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomic analysis applied to exhaled breath condensate ('breathomics'). Information coming from NMR spectra was analyzed with a view to establish the NMR variables that best discriminate between children with asthma and healthy children. Methods: Twenty-five children with asthma (17 with persistent asthma treated with inhaled corticosteroids, 8 with intermittent asthma inhaled corticosteroid naive; age, 7-15 yr) and 11 healthy age-matched control subjects were enrolled. Every child performed exhaled nitric oxide measurement, spirometry, and condensate collection. Condensate samples were analyzed by means of NMR spectroscopy. Linear and partial least squares discriminant analyses were applied to data obtained from the NMR spectra. Measurements and Main Results: The combination of exhaled nitric oxide and FEV(1) discriminates children with asthma and healthy children with a success rate of approximately 81%, whereas selected signals from NMR spectra offer a slightly better discrimination ( approximately 86%). The selected NMR variables derive from the region of 3.2 to 3.4 ppm, indicative of oxidized compounds, and from the region of 1.7 to 2.2 ppm, indicative of acetylated compounds. Conclusions: Metabolomics can be applied to exhaled breath condensate, leading to the characterization of airway biochemical fingerprints. The presence of acetylated compounds suggests new metabolic pathways that may have a role in asthma pathophysiology.

AB  - BACKGROUND:: Despite significant advances in treatment modalities, morbidity due to childhood asthma has continued to increase, particularly for poor and minority children. OBJECTIVES:: To describe the parental illness representation of asthma in juxtaposition to the professional model of asthma and to evaluate the impact of that illness representation on the adequacy of the child's medication regimen. METHODS:: Parents (n = 228) of children with asthma were interviewed regarding illness beliefs using a semistructured interview. The impact of background characteristics, parental beliefs, the child's symptom interpretation, and the parent-healthcare provider (HCP) relationship on the adequacy of the child's medication regimen were evaluated. RESULTS:: The parental and professional models of asthma differ markedly. Demographic risk factors (p = .005), low parental education (p < .0001), inaccurate symptom evaluation by the child (p = .02), and a poor parent-HCP relationship (p < .0001) had a negative effect on the parental illness representation. A parental illness representation concordant with the professional model of asthma (p = .05) and more formal asthma education (p = .02) had a direct positive effect on the medication regimen. Demographic risk factors (p = .006) and informal advice-seeking (p = .0003) had a negative impact on the regimen. The parental illness representation mediated the impact of demographic risk factors (p = .10), parental education (p =.07), and the parent-HCP relationship (p = .06) on the regimen. DISCUSSION:: Parents and HCPs may come to the clinical encounter with markedly different illness representations. Establishing a partnership with parents by eliciting and acknowledging parental beliefs is an important component of improving disease management.

AB  - Asthma prevalence in the Cataño Air Basin of Puerto Rico is 27% for children aged 13-14 years and 45% for children aged 5-6 years. There is concern that these rates are related to air pollution. The authors conducted a nested case-control study to evaluate whether proximity to air pollution point sources was associated with increased risk of asthma attacks. For 1997-2001, 1,382 asthma-related medical visits (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes 493 and 493.9) in children under 17 were identified through health insurance claims. Controls were children with no asthma attacks who were randomly selected from enrollees in two health insurance companies by incidence density sampling (1:5) and matched to cases on gender, age, insurance company, and event date. The distance from a point source to the subject's residence area represented a surrogate exposure measurement. Odds ratios for a 1-km decrease in distance were obtained by conditional logistic regression. Risk of asthma attack was associated with residing near a grain mill (odds ratio (OR) = 1.35), petroleum refinery (OR = 1.44), asphalt plant (OR = 1.23), or power plant (OR = 1.28) (all p's < 0.05). Residence near major air emissions sources (>100 tons/year) increased asthma attack risk by 108% (p < 0.05). These results showed that proximity to some air pollution sources is associated with increased risks of asthma attacks.

AB  - Background: Few studies have investigated adult-onset wheezing because of difficulties identifying childhood asthma or wheeze retrospectively.Objective: To investigate risk factors for the incidence and recurrence of wheezing illness in adulthood.Methods: British children born during 1 week in 1958 (N = 18,558) were followed up periodically. Information on wheezing illness was obtained via parental interviews at ages 7, 11, and 16 years and via cohort member interviews at ages 23, 33, and 42 years. At ages 44 to 45 years a subset (N = 12,069) was targeted for biomedical survey, and total IgE and specific IgE responses to grass, cat, and dust mite were measured.Results: Incidences of wheezing illness at ages 17 to 33 and 34 to 42 years were positively associated with atopy (any specific IgE -0.3 kU/L) and cigarette smoking. For ages 17 to 42 years, proportions of incident "asthma" and incident "wheeze without asthma" associated with atopy, adjusted for sex and smoking, were estimated to be 34% (95% confidence interval [CI], 26%-42%) and 5% (95% CI, 1%-9%), respectively, whereas proportions associated with cigarette smoking, adjusted for sex and atopy, were estimated to be 13% (95% CI, 0%-26%) and 34% (95% CI, 27%-40%), respectively. Among participants with no reported wheezing illness at ages 17 to 23 or 33 years, wheeze prevalence at the age of 42 years was positively associated with symptoms in childhood.Conclusions: Onset and relapse of wheezing illness in adult life seem to be similarly affected by atopy and cigarette smoking, although the nature of these effects may differ between asthma and wheeze without asthma. Children who apparently "outgrow" early wheezing illness remain at increased risk for relapse or recurrence during midlife.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Evidence for the heterogeneity of response to asthma medications including inhaled corticosteroids and leukotriene receptor antagonists is mounting. beta2-Adrenoceptor gene polymorphisms may contribute to asthma responsiveness to short- and long-acting beta2-agonists. This review examines recent articles describing variability in response to inhaled corticosteroids, leukotriene receptor antagonists and short-acting beta2-agonists specifically in pediatric persistent asthmatics. RECENT FINDINGS: In the late 1990's, differences in the response to a leukotriene receptor antagonist and an inhaled corticosteroid in adults with moderate persistent asthma were first described. Subsequently, similar findings have recently been elucidated in children with mild to moderate persistent asthma. The variability in response to these two classes of control medicines now appears to encompass all ages with persistent asthma. In general, despite the variability in response to these medications, both resulted in improved clinical and physiologic control measures. SUMMARY: Childhood asthma is a complex disease with numerous clinical phenotypes that contribute to response variability to asthma medications.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The review characterizes airway remodelling in childhood asthma and describes how early in life it is possible to detect, and possibly cure, the cellular and biochemical changes that characterize this event. This topic is timely and relevant since a variety of clinical and epidemiologic studies strongly suggest that in asthma, remodelling may start very early in life and that current prevention and treatment measures, including early avoidance measures and pharmaceutical interventions, are relatively ineffective in preventing the development of irreversible airway changes or in reverting them, once established. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent findings show that structural changes characterizing remodelling, such as subepithelial basement membrane thickening, epithelial cell disruption, protease/antiprotease imbalance and neoangiogenesis, are detectable in children with asthma and even in children with respiratory symptoms or with atopy, before a clear clinical diagnosis of bronchial asthma is made. SUMMARY: Identification of the early structural changes that may precede the development of asthma and of factors leading to permanent loss of lung function appear central to future asthma management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Polymorphisms in the proinflammatory cytokine genes tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and lymphotoxin-alpha (LTA, also called TNF-beta) have been associated with asthma and atopy in some studies. Parental smoking is a consistent risk factor for childhood asthma. Secondhand smoke and ozone both stimulate TNF production. OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to investigate whether genetic variation in TNF and LTA is associated with asthma and atopy and whether the association is modified by parental smoking in a Mexican population with high ozone exposure. METHODS: We genotyped six tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TNF and LTA, including functional variants, in 596 nuclear families consisting of asthmatics 4-17 years of age and their parents in Mexico City. Atopy was determined by skin prick tests. RESULTS: The A allele of the TNF-308 SNP was associated with increased risk of asthma [relative risk (RR) = 1.54; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04-2.28], especially among children of non-smoking parents (RR = 2.06; 95% CI, 1.19-3.55; p for interaction = 0.09). Similarly, the A allele of the TNF-238 SNP was associated with increased asthma risk among children of nonsmoking parents (RR = 2.21; 95% CI, 1.14-4.30; p for interaction = 0.01). LTA SNPs were not associated with asthma. Haplotype analyses reflected the single SNP findings in magnitude and direction. TNF and LTA SNPs were not associated with the degree of atopy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that genetic variation in TNF may contribute to childhood asthma and that associations may be modified by parental smoking.

AB  - The burden of asthma has increased dramatically despite increased understanding of asthma and new medication regimens. Data reported here are part of a larger study investigating factors that influence parental asthma illness representation and the impact of this representation on treatment outcomes, including the parent/health care provider relationship. We investigated the influence of asthma related education provided by health care providers on these outcomes. After interviewing 228 parents of children with asthma, we found that asthma education received from the child's health care providers positively influenced parental belief systems, especially attitudes towards anti-inflammatory medications and facts about asthma. Parents who reported receiving more education also reported stronger partnerships with their child's health care provider. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Res Nurs Health 30: 203-212, 2007.

AB  - Asthma is the most common chronic illness in childhood and represents a significant burden to health care and educational systems. Between one quarter and two thirds of childhood asthma cases persist into adulthood. Childhood asthma may be particularly difficult to diagnose because of the high prevalence of episodic wheezing and cough in childhood illnesses such as upper respiratory tract infections. National and worldwide guidelines for the management of asthma in children are continually being updated. These guidelines recommend first establishing a diagnosis and assessing the severity of disease, initiating pharmacologic therapy based on symptoms and lung function, and adjusting doses and agents as required based on the level of asthma control. Inhaled corticosteroids are the cornerstone of long-term asthma management in children of all ages. Recent research efforts have focused on ways to improve inhalant drug delivery to the lungs and minimize oral and systemic bioavailability so as to improve the therapeutic benefit:risk ratio.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Several epidemiological studies have confirmed the association between viral respiratory infections and wheezing episodes or exacerbations of asthma in childhood. In contrast, whether particular viral infections can be protective or able to initiate asthma is still debated; recent studies reported herein have added to our understanding in several different domains, including natural history, virology and mechanisms. RECENT FINDINGS: Animal studies support the possibility that severe infections with respiratory syncytial virus early in life may be able to diverge the immune response towards an allergic phenotype; however, in human studies, predisposition seems dominating. Human rhinoviruses are increasingly being shown to be equally important as respiratory syncytial virus even in infancy. Newly discovered respiratory viruses have also been associated with asthma exacerbations. The interferon pathway is currently scrutinized with respect to virus-induced inflammation; furthermore, indications that viral infections may be associated with remodeling phenotypes have been recently published. SUMMARY: Notwithstanding the progress in epidemiology and pathogenesis of virus-induced asthma, more effort is needed in assessing possible strategies for treatment. Current treatments seem to be relatively ineffective, but new pathways give a hopeful message for future therapies.

AB  - The burden of asthma for children in the United States is substantial and has continued to rise for the past 2 decades. There is growing evidence that the indoor environment may play an important role in the pathogenesis of childhood asthma. This article first reviews the effects of indoor allergen exposure and sensitization on asthma incidence and morbidity, focusing on dust mite, cockroach, pet, and rodent allergens. It then addresses the effects of indoor air pollutants (ozone, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, environmental tobacco smoke, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide) on asthma morbidity.

AB  - Viral infections are important causes of asthma exacerbations in children, and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), caused by viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (RV), are a leading cause of bronchiolitis in infants. Infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis are at significantly increased risk for both recurrent wheezing and childhood asthma. To date, studies addressing the incidence of asthma after bronchiolitis severe enough to warrant hospitalization have focused almost exclusively on RSV, but a number of recent studies suggest that other respiratory pathogens, including RV, may contribute as well. It is not known whether viral bronchiolitis directly contributes to asthma causation or simply identifies infants at risk for subsequent wheezing, as from an atopic predisposition or preexisting abnormal lung function. Alternatively, the properties of the infecting virus may be important. Thus, many possible determinants exist that may contribute to the severity of bronchiolitis and the subsequent development of asthma. One such determinant is the potential involvement of genetic susceptibility loci to asthma after viral bronchiolitis, a critical area that is just beginning to be evaluated. By clarifying the roles of both host- (genetic) and virus- (environment) specific factors that contribute to the frequency and severity of viral LRTI, it may be possible to determine if severe LRTIs cause asthma, or if asthma susceptibility predisposes patients to severe LRTI in response to viral infection. Characterizing these relationships offers the potential of identifying at-risk hosts in whom preventing or delaying infection could alter the phenotypic expression of asthma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been hypothesised that the rise in childhood asthma in the developed world could result at least in part from the increasing exposure of children to toxic chlorination products in the air of indoor swimming pools. OBJECTIVES: Ecological study to evaluate whether this hypothesis can explain the geographical variation in the prevalence of asthma and other atopic diseases in Europe. METHODS: The relationships between the prevalences of wheezing by written or video questionnaire, of ever asthma, hay fever, rhinitis, and atopic eczema as reported by the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC), and the number of indoor chlorinated swimming pools per inhabitant in the studied centres were examined. Associations with geoclimatic variables, the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and several other lifestyle indicators were also evaluated. RESULTS: Among children aged 13-14 years, the prevalence of wheezing by written questionnaire, of wheezing by video questionnaire, and of ever asthma across Europe increased respectively by 3.39% (95% CI 1.96 to 4.81), 0.96% (95% CI 0.28 to 1.64), and 2.73% (95% CI 1.94 to 3.52), with an increase of one indoor chlorinated pool per 100 000 inhabitants. Similar increases were found when analysing separately centres in Western or Northern Europe and for ever asthma in Southern Europe. In children aged 6-7 years (33 centres), the prevalence of ever asthma also increased with swimming pool availability (1.47%; 95% CI 0.21 to 2.74). These consistent associations were not found with other atopic diseases and were independent of the influence of altitude, climate, and GDP per capita. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of childhood asthma and availability of indoor swimming pools in Europe are linked through associations that are consistent with the hypothesis implicating pool chlorine in the rise of childhood asthma in industrialised countries.

AB  - African American children in the United States are disproportionately affected by childhood asthma. Despite the enormous effort that has gone into developing educational interventions to teach patients and families self-management skills, morbidity and mortality rates continue to rise, especially for the African American child (CDC, 2005). In an attempt to increase understanding of the factors that may influence self-management of chronic disease, this study examined the relationship between asthma self-efficacy belief and asthma self-management in urban African American children. The study, using a descriptive correlational design, surveyed 81 urban African American children age 7-12 years old with self reported asthma. The relationship among asthma self-efficacy and asthma self-management was explored using the Asthma Belief Survey and Asthma Inventory Control survey. Results demonstrated a significant positive correlation (r=.529, p<.01) between the child's asthma self-efficacy and asthma self-management behaviors. As self-efficacy scores increased, the child's use of more asthma self-management behaviors also increased. Although limited by the design, this study continues to contribute to the body knowledge regarding the psychological construct of self-efficacy and how it is relates to asthma self-management in African American children. Health care providers who work with children with asthma may find that educational interventions designed to enhance self-efficacy may improve self-management in this population of children.

AB  - Objective: To describe a pilot program that utilized patient and physician education plus collaboration with managed care organizations (MCOs) to reduce hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) visits due to asthma in children.Methods: Ten pediatric practices in suburban New York State participated. A specialist team consisting of a pediatric pulmonologist/allergist and a nurse practitioner made 7 visits to the practices over 2 years to provide education to providers. 64 patients aged 0 to 17 years from these practices who had a history of asthma-related hospital admissions were selected to receive a 2-hour initial session with the specialist team followed by monthly phone calls from the nurse practitioner.Results: There was a significant reduction in hospital admissions, from 62 (3.43/1000 members) to 28 (1.6/1000) in the first year and to 27 (1.7/1000) in the second year. ED visits were reduced from 110 (7.46/1000 members) to 66 (5.19/1000) in the first year and to 77 (6.2/1000) in the second year. Conclusion: Collaboration with MCOs to educate physicians and patients provides a promising frame-work for reduction of hospital admissions and ED visits due to childhood asthma.

AB  - Current guidelines recommend environmental control practices (ECPs) as part of asthma management. We investigated the relationship of caregiver health beliefs and asthma experiences to ECP use in homes of children with asthma.Caregivers of children with asthma (ages 2 to 6 years) completed a survey about indoor environmental exposures, ECPs, physician ECP recommendations, caregiver health beliefs and experiences (outcome expectancy, self-efficacy, emotional bother) regarding ECPs, child's respiratory symptoms, and medication use. Allergic sensitization was determined by skin prick testing.Children (n = 150) were 58% male, 91% African American, 42% from households with annual income <$25,000, and 63% had persistent asthma symptoms. Caregivers who had higher outcome expectancy were more likely to report use of ECP than those with lower outcome expectancy (smoking avoidance (70 vs. 33%), roach control (61 vs. 44%), pet avoidance (42 vs. 24%), allergen-proof mattress/pillow encasings (6 vs. 0%), carpet removal (12 vs. 2%), and stuffed-animal removal (8 vs. 1%) (all p < 0.05)). Self-efficacy and emotional bother were not associated with use or failure to use most ECPs. Most caregivers (83%) reported that their child's physician had recommended smoking avoidance; however, less than half had recommended avoidance of specific allergens. Caregivers who reported that physicians recommended pet avoidance, allergen-proof mattress/pillow encasings, bed linens washing, or stuffed-animal removal were more likely to have high outcome expectancy for the ECP.This study demonstrates a strong link between physician recommendations, higher caregiver outcome expectancy, and greater reported use of ECPs. Given the role of the environment on childhood asthma, physicians should be encouraged to counsel caregivers about ECPs.

AB  - Rationale: Although involuntary exposure to maternal smoking during the in utero period and to secondhand smoke are associated with occurrence of childhood asthma, few studies have investigated the role of active cigarette smoking on asthma onset during adolescence.Objectives: To determine whether regular smoking is associated with the new onset of asthma during adolescence.Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study among 2,609 children with no lifetime history of asthma or wheezing who were recruited from fourth- and seventh-grade classrooms and followed annually in schools in 12 southern California communities. Regular smoking was defined as smoking at least seven cigarettes per day on average over the week before and 300 cigarettes in the year before each annual interview. Incident asthma was defined using new cases of physician-diagnosed asthma.Measurements and Main Results: Regular smoking was associated with increased risk of new-onset asthma. Children who reported smoking 300 or more cigarettes per year had a relative risk (RR) of 3.9 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.7-8.5) for new-onset asthma compared with nonsmokers. The increased risk from regular smoking was greater in nonallergic than in allergic children. Regular smokers who were exposed to maternal smoking during gestation had the largest risk from active smoking (RR, 8.8; 95% CI, 3.2-24.0).Conclusions: Regular smoking increased risk for asthma among adolescents, especially for nonallergic adolescents and those exposed to maternal smoking during the in utero period.

AB  - RATIONALE: Airway remodeling and inflammation are characteristic features of adult asthma that are still poorly investigated in childhood asthma. OBJECTIVES: To examine epithelial and vascular changes as well as the inflammatory response in airways of children with asthma. METHODS: We analyzed bronchial biopsies obtained from 44 children undergoing bronchoscopy for appropriate clinical indications other than asthma: 17 with mild/moderate asthma (aged 2-15 yr), 12 with atopy without asthma (1-11 yr), and 15 control children without atopy or asthma (1-14 yr). By histochemistry and immunohistochemistry, we quantified epithelial loss, basement membrane thickness, number of vessels, and inflammatory cells in subepithelium. RESULTS: Epithelial loss and basement membrane thickness were increased in children with asthma compared with control subjects (p = 0.005 and p = 0.0002, respectively) and atopic children (p = 0.002 and p = 0.005, respectively). The number of vessels and eosinophils was increased not only in asthmatic children (p = 0.03 and p = 0.0002, respectively) but also in atopic children without asthma (p = 0.03 and p = 0.008, respectively) compared with control subjects. When we stratified the analysis according to age, we observed that children with asthma younger than 6 yr had increased epithelial loss, basement membrane thickening, and eosinophilia compared with control subjects of the same age. CONCLUSIONS: Epithelial damage and basement membrane thickening, which are pathologic features characteristic of adult asthma, are present even in childhood asthma. Other changes, such as airway eosinophilia and angiogenesis, were also observed in atopic children without asthma. These observations suggest that pathologic changes occur early in the natural history of asthma and emphasize the concept that some of these lesions may characterize atopy even in the absence of asthmatic symptoms.

AB  - The influence of physical housing quality on childhood asthma expression, especially the effect of exposure to moulds, allergens, and pollutants, is well documented. However, attempts to explain increasing rates and severity of childhood asthma solely through physical environmental factors have been unsuccessful, and additional exposures may be involved. Increasing evidence has linked psychological stress and negative affective states to asthma expression. At the same time, recent scholarship in the social sciences has focused on understanding how social environments, such as housing, "get under the skin" to influence health, and suggests that psychological factors play a key role. While there is relevant overlapping research in social science, psychology, economics, and health policy in this area, findings from these disciplines have not yet been conceptually integrated into ongoing asthma research. We propose to expand the dimensions of housing considered in future asthma research to include both physical and psychological aspects which may directly and indirectly influence onset and severity of disease expression. This synthesis of overlapping research from a number of disciplines argues for the systematic measure of psychological dimensions of housing and consideration of the interplay between housing stress and physical housing characteristics in relation to childhood asthma.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study's objective is to determine if there is an association between rates of violence and rates of childhood asthma in Los Angeles County communities. METHODS: Rates of hospitalization for assault and for asthma were calculated for each ZIP Code and city in Los Angeles County. Linear regression was used to determine the effect of assault rates on asthma rates while controlling for potential confounders such as poverty and racial/ethnic distribution. At the city level, crime rates were included in the model as additional measures of community violence. RESULTS: Hospitalization rates for childhood asthma and assaults were significantly correlated at both the city (r = 0.80) and the ZIP Code (r = 0.54) levels. The association remained significant when controlling for poverty and racial/ethnic distribution with linear regression (p < 0.0001). At the city level, the variables measuring the crime rate were not significant predictors of asthma hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: Community violence as measured by the rate of assault hospi; talizations is associated with childhood asthma in Los Angeles County. Health care providers should consider their asthmatic patients' social environments when devising treatment plans.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthmatic patients have a T[H]2-predominant milieu that is associated with humoral immunity. However, little is known about whether humoral immune responses to viral antigens differ between asthmatic and nonasthmatic children. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether humoral immune response differs in asthmatic patients vs nonasthmatic patients. METHODS: Measles virus specific IgG antibody levels were determined for the Rochester Family Measles Study cohort (n = 876), a convenience sample of healthy children 5 to 12 years of age in Rochester, MN. We conducted comprehensive medical record reviews of 838 children who were eligible for this study. We determined the child's asthma status at the time of determination of antibody levels by applying predetermined criteria for asthma. Comparisons were made using the 2-sample t test or chi2 test. RESULTS: Of the 838 children, 156 (18.6%) had asthma at the time of the determination of antibody levels and were not taking systemic steroids within 14 days of specimen collection. Among those with a nonequivocal antibody reading, the seropositive response rates were similar in asthmatic patients and nonasthmatic patients (89.7% vs 90.3%, respectively; P = .83). However, the equivocal response rates were slightly higher among asthmatic patients than nonasthmatic patients (6.4% vs 4.7%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Asthmatic children seem to have similar humoral immune responses to measles vaccine as those without asthma. Although the findings reassure health care practitioners, whether this finding is generalizable to other vaccines and whether asthmatic patients with low antibody levels have normal cell-mediated immunity need to be elucidated in future studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about how childhood asthma affects immigrant Hispanic families in the United States. Qualitative research is effective for understanding the social, cultural, functional, and structural aspects of asthma in the family context. Furthermore, such knowledge is necessary to develop culturally appropriate interventions for these families. OBJECTIVES: To describe participants' perceptions of their roles in caring for an asthmatic child, to compare family patterns of caring for an asthmatic child by parents' country of origin, to identify barriers to caring for an asthmatic child, and to evaluate specific coping needs of low-income immigrant Hispanic families caring for an asthmatic child. METHODS: Five focus groups were conducted with low-income, immigrant, Spanish-speaking Hispanic adults caring for an asthmatic child, including community health workers, mothers, fathers, and grandparents, along with women with asthma. Audiotaped focus groups were transcribed verbatim in Spanish, forward translated into English, and back translated into Spanish. Data analysis was performed using qualitative analytic methods. RESULTS: Forty-one participants represented a range of countries of origin. Different themes emerged for community health workers vs parents and grandparents and for women vs men caring for a child with asthma. All the participants reported strong beliefs in using folk medicines. Barriers identified included language, culture, poverty, lack of health insurance, and poor living conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight the lack of asthma self-management skills, diagnostic uncertainty, and the use of folk medicine as factors that should be taken into consideration when tailoring interventions to improve asthma outcomes in this vulnerable population.

AB  - Inhaled corticosteroids are effective and safe treatments for childhood asthma in standard doses, yet at high dosages they may be associated with adverse events and suboptimal outcomes; add-on therapy is, therefore, recommended to minimise their use. We quantified prescribing of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and add-on therapy in children in July 2003 and found that high-dose inhaled corticosteroids were prescribed to 10% of children aged 5-11 years and 6% of under-5's who were treated for asthma. Add-on therapy was lacking for almost half of these individuals. Some children were receiving treatment not in accord with current licences and evidence-based recommendations and, as such, may be at risk of adverse outcomes.

AB  - The pool chlorine hypothesis postulates that the rise in childhood asthma in the developed world could result at least partly from the increasing exposure of children to toxic gases and aerosols contaminating the air of indoor chlorinated pools. To further assess this hypothesis, we explored the relationships between childhood asthma, atopy, and cumulated pool attendance (CPA). We studied 341 schoolchildren 10-13 years of age who attended at a variable rate the same public pool in Brussels (trichloramine in air, 0.3-0.5 mg/m3). Examination of the children included a questionnaire, an exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) test, and the measurement of exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) and total and aeroallergen-specific serum IgE. CPA by children (range, 0-1,818 hr) emerged among the most consistent predictors of asthma (doctor diagnosed or screened with the EIB test) and of elevated eNO, ranking immediately after atopy and family history of asthma or hay fever. Although the risk of elevated eNO increased with CPA [odds ratio (OR) = 1.30; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.10-1.43] independently of total or specific serum IgE, the probability of developing asthma increased with CPA only in children with serum IgE > 100 kIU/L (OR for each 100-hr increase in CPA = 1.79; 95% CI, 1.07-2.72). All these effects were dose related and most strongly linked to pool attendance before 6-7 years of age. Use of indoor chlorinated pools especially by young children interacts with atopic status to promote the development of childhood asthma. These findings further support the hypothesis implicating pool chlorine in the rise of childhood asthma in industrialized countries.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Early-life exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) can result in developmental delay as well as childhood asthma and increased risk of cancer. The high cost of childhood asthma related to ETS exposure has been widely recognized; however, the economic impact of ETS-related developmental delay has been less well understood. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health (CCCEH) has reported adverse effects of prenatal ETS exposure on child development in a cohort of minority women and children in New York City (odds ratio of developmental delay = 2.36; 95% confidence interval 1.22-4.58). Using the environmentally attributable fraction (EAF) approach, we estimated the annual cost of one aspect of ETS-related developmental delay: Early Intervention Services. The estimated cost of these services per year due to ETS exposure is > Dollars 50 million per year for New York City Medicaid births and Dollars 99 million per year for all New York City births. CONCLUSION: The high annual cost of just one aspect of developmental delay due to prenatal exposure to ETS provides further impetus for increased prevention efforts such as educational programs to promote smoke-free homes, additional cigarette taxes, and subsidizing of smoking cessation programs.

AB  - This study purposed to characterize the psychomotor profile of eleven children at the age of seven and eight years old (8,01±0,55) with severe asthma and to compare them with healthy children at the same age (7,94±0,60). The children with severe asthma diagnosis were recruited from Support Group of Respiratory Education Program (GAPER) and the healthy children from the Graciela Elizabete Almada Diaz Municipal School on Paranagua city. The assessment instrument used was Fonseca's Psychomotor Battery (PMB) 1995, which consists of seven categories: Tonicity, Equilibration, Lateralization, Body Perception; Time-sspacial Structurization, Global Praxis, and Fine Praxis; to classify the profile psychomotor in apraxic, dyspraxic, eupraxic and hyperpraxic. Through Qui-quadrate test (p</=0,05) it was possible to verify that there were different statistics between the groups on Body Perception and Fine Praxis. Considering Body Perception the control group presented superior profile (eupraxic) in relation to asthma group (eupraxic and dyspraxic profile). In the Fine Praxis profile the control group presented superior profile too (eupraxic and hyperpraxic profile) in relation to asthma group (dyspraxic profile). Therefore, it was possible to find out that asthma may interfere at some child's motor abilities acquisition. Although, these difficulties on Body Perception and Fine Praxis didn't have severe influence on the psychomotor development oh these children, whose general profile psychomotor was normal. So it is necessary to be added more researches to find out concluded results in relation of the population, and to analyses others variables like sex and environment influences.

AB  - School-age children spend a significant portion of their day at school where they can be exposed to asthma triggers, but little information exists regarding potential relationships between childhood asthma and school environmental factors. This study examined patterns of asthma hospitalization and possible factors contributing to asthma hospitalizations, including sociodemographics and school environmental factors, among school-age children (5-18 years) in New York State (NYS) over an 11-year period (1991-2001). Asthma hospitalization data from the Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System and the 1990 and 2000 census population files were geocoded into NYS school districts statewide, and school district asthma hospitalization rates were then calculated. Building Condition Survey for each school was then utilized to create summary measures of school building conditions for each school district. Hospitalization rates were linked to district school building conditions by using logistic regression analysis that controlled for poverty. Calculation of time trends revealed overall declines in asthma rates among school-age children for NYS from 1991 to 2001. This general decline was found in each sociodemographic group. The mean rate for NYS from 1991 to 2001 was 27/10,000. Poorly rated building systems that were significantly associated with increased school district asthma hospitalization rates were roofing (odds ratio [OR] = 1.76; 95% confidence interval [CI(95)] = 1.13-2.74), windows (OR = 1.66; CI(95)= 1.08-2.54), exterior walls (OR = 2.24; CI(95)= 1.31-3.83), floor finishes (OR = 1.75; CI(95)= 1.14-2.69), and boiler/furnace (OR = 1.71; CI(95)= 1.99-2.94). This does not indicate a definite link between these systems and asthma hospitalizations since the available building system information is very general and crude.

AB  - The authors investigated the relation between ambient concentrations of five of the Environmental Protection Agency's criteria pollutants and asthma exacerbations (daily symptoms and use of rescue inhalers) among 990 children in eight North American cities during the 22-month prerandomization phase (November 1993-September 1995) of the Childhood Asthma Management Program. Short-term effects of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter less than 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM(10)), sulfur dioxide, and warm-season ozone were examined in both one-pollutant and two-pollutant models, using lags of up to 2 days. Lags in carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide were positively associated with both measures of asthma exacerbation, and the 3-day moving sum of sulfur dioxide levels was marginally related to asthma symptoms. PM(10) and ozone were unrelated to exacerbations. The strongest effects tended to be seen with 2-day lags, where a 1-parts-per-million change in carbon monoxide and a 20-parts-per-billion change in nitrogen dioxide were associated with symptom odds ratios of 1.08 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02, 1.15) and 1.09 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.15), respectively, and with rate ratios for rescue inhaler use of 1.06 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.10) and 1.05 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.09), respectively. The authors believe that the observed carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide associations can probably be attributed to mobile-source emissions, though more research is required.

AB  - Objectives. We assessed whether the association between low birthweight and early childhood asthma can be explained by an extensive set of individual- and neighborhood-level measures. Methods. A population-based sample of children born in large US cities during 1998-2000 was followed from birth to age 3 years (N=1803). Associations between low birthweight and asthma diagnosis at age 3 years were estimated using multilevel models. Prenatal medical risk factors and behaviors, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, and neighborhood characteristics were controlled. Results. Low-birthweight children were twice as likely as normal birthweight children to have an asthma diagnosis (34% vs 18%). The fully adjusted association (OR= 2.36; P<.001) was very similar to the unadjusted association (OR= 2.48; P<.001). Rates of renter-occupied housing and vacancies at the census tractSlevel were strong independent predictors of childhood asthma. Conclusions. Very little of the association between low birthweight and asthma at age 3 can be explained by an extensive set of demographic, socioeconomic, medical, behavioral, and neighborhood characteristics. Associations between neighborhood housing characteristics and asthma diagnosis in early childhood need to be further explored.

AB  - Background: One barrier to receiving adequate asthma care is inaccurate estimations of symptom severity.Aims: To interview parents of children with asthma in order to: (1) describe the range of reported illness severity using three unstructured methods of assessment; (2) determine which assessment method is least likely to result in a "critical error" that could adversely influence the child's care; and (3) determine whether the likelihood of making a "critical error" varies by sociodemographic characteristics.Methods: A total of 228 parents of children with asthma participated. Clinical status was evaluated using structured questions reflecting National Asthma Education and Prevention Panel (NAEPP) criteria. Unstructured assessments of severity were determined using a visual analogue scale (VAS), a categorical assessment of severity, and a Likert scale assessment of asthma control. A "critical error" was defined as a parent report of symptoms in the lower 50th centile for each method of assessment for children with moderate-severe persistent symptoms by NAEPP criteria.Results: Children with higher severity according to NAEPP criteria were rated on each unstructured assessment as more symptomatic compared to those with less severe symptoms. However, among the children with moderate-severe persistent symptoms, many parents made a critical error and rated children in the lower 50th centile using the VAS (41%), the categorical assessment (45%), and the control assessment (67%). The likelihood of parents making a critical error did not vary by sociodemographic characteristics.Conclusions: All of the unstructured assessment methods tested yielded underestimations of severity that could adversely influence treatment decisions. Specific symptom questions are needed for accurate severity assessments.

AB  - Objective: To find the clinical signs that are the best predictors of hypoxemia (SpO2 =92%) in acute asthma in children.Methods: Color of skin, dyspnea (by single breath counting), alertness, respiratory rate, presence of audible wheeze, wheezing on auscultation, accessory muscle use, nasal flaring, pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulsus paradoxus and oxygen saturation at room air (by pulse oximetry) were recorded at the time of presentation and one hour after presentation after completion of 3 doses of nebulized salbutamol and budesonide.Results: Hypoxemia (SpO2 92% pounds sterling) was seen in 45% children at presentation and 14(28.6%) after one hour. The clinical signs that correlated significantly with hypoxemia at both time points were dyspnea assessed by single breath count (OR 3.3, 95% CI 0.9-12.9), accessory muscle use score > or = 3 (OR 3.0, 95% CI 0.9-15.4) and pulsus paradoxus> 10 (OR 3.0, 95% CI 0.7-13.6). In a multiple logistic regression model accessory muscle score > or = 3 and pulsus paradoxus> 10 were identified as independent predictors of hypoxemia (sensitivity 64.3%, specificity 91%).Conclusion: Physical assessment in a child with acute exacerbation of asthma should at least include accessory muscle use and pulsus paradoxus, since these predict hypoxemia the best.

AB  - Background: Functionally relevant polymorphisms of the beta2-adrenoceptor gene (ADRB2) are common in white populations, but their contribution to the burden of airways disease in the population is uncertain. We aimed to relate the long-term prevalence of asthma or wheeze to functional coding region polymorphisms in the ADRB2 gene.Methods: The British 1958 birth cohort consisted of all people born in Britain during a week in 1958. Asthma, wheezy bronchitis, and wheezing were ascertained by interview at ages 7, 11, 16, 23, 33, and 42 years, and lung function tests at 35 and 45 years. DNA samples from 8018 participants in the 45-year follow-up were genotyped for three coding variants in the ADRB2 gene. We extend the follow-up of this nationwide cohort by a further 10 years and relate asthma prevalence, prognosis, and lung function to functional coding region polymorphisms in the ADRB2 gene in the cohort members who contributed DNA samples. We also compared and combined our findings with those reaching significance in two previous meta-analyses.Findings: Half the cohort (4105 of 8018) had some history of wheezing illness by age 42 years. Neither lifetime prevalence nor age at onset were related to ADRB2 coding variants. However, the common polymorphisms Arg16Gly (rs1042713, Arg 16 allele frequency 36.3%) and Gln27Glu (rs1042714, Glu 27 allele frequency 44.6%) were significantly associated with persistence of asthmatic symptoms from childhood to middle age. Among homozygotes for the Arg16-Gln27 haplotype at these loci, 19.3% (41 of 212) childhood wheezers had five or more wheezing episodes in the past year at age 42, compared with 11.9% (71 of 599) with no copy of this haplotype. However, only 3% of all frequent adult wheezing was statistically attributable to this haplotype. The less common Thr164Ile polymorphism (rs1800888, Ile allele frequency 1.5%) was not a major predictor of either frequency or prognosis of asthma. Our data do not support the findings of previous meta-analyses when considered in isolation or when combined with their contributory studies.Interpretation: ADRB2 polymorphisms might predict a small component of the long-term prognosis in childhood asthma, but are not important determinants of asthma incidence or prevalence in the British population.

AB  - Rationale: Exhaled breath condensate pH (EBC-pH) may be useful noninvasive marker for evaluation of patients with asthma. Objectives: To investigate the relationship between EBC-pH and symptoms suggestive of childhood asthma in an epidemiologic setting and examine its relation to lung function, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and airway inflammation. Methods: Within the context of a prospective population-based birth cohort, EBC was collected from 630 children at age 8 yr using the RTube (pH measured after deaeration with argon). Lung function was measured by spirometry (FEV(1); n = 521) and plethysmography (sRaw; n = 567), and AHR by methacholine challenge (n = 498). Airway inflammation was assessed using exhaled nitric oxide (eNO; n = 305). Results: EBC-pH values ranged widely (4.40-8.29), and did not differ between 54 children with parentally reported asthma and 562 nonasthmatic subjects (median [interquartile range]: 7.75 [7.45-7.85] vs. 7.77 [7.59-7.87]; p = 0.35). There was a trend for lower EBC-pH among current wheezers (n = 98; 7.72 [7.50-7.83]) compared with nonwheezers (n = 532; 7.77 [7.60-7.87]; p = 0.07). Wheeze frequency, severity, and use of antiasthma medication were not associated with EBC-pH. There was no consistent association between EBC-pH and lung function, airway reactivity, and airway inflammation (FEV(1), sRaw, PD(20) methacholine, or eNO). There was no significant difference in EBC-pH between current wheezers receiving asthma medication who had positive methacholine challenge compared with children without any of these features. Conclusions: In the epidemiologic setting, EBC-pH does not differ between children with and without parentally reported symptoms suggestive of asthma. We found no consistent association between EBC-pH and lung function, AHR, and airway inflammation in this sample from the general population.

AB  - Cases of asthma are increasing dramatically. Asthma is the most common chronic disease among children. Children's health and education can be affected by uncontrolled disease. Families play an important role in childhood asthma management. The main purpose of this study was to understand the parental stress and associated coping behaviors of mothers of children with asthma. The study adopted the survey design with the purposive sampling method. Data collection took place between December, 2003 and February, 2004. Sixty-eight mothers participated in the research. Data were collected with structured questionnaires, incorporating the Parental Distress Rating Scale, the Parental Coping Behavior Rating Scale, the Seriousness of Asthma Symptom Rating Scale and Demographic Data Sheet. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS/10.0 software. The results showed that factors affecting the mother's stress, included her age and the seriousness of the child's disease. Factors affecting the mother's coping behaviors included the mother's educational level, the child's age, the seriousness of the child's disease, the mother's age, the number of asthmatic children in the family, and the mother's system of belief. Using multiple regression analysis, the number of asthmatic children in the family, and the mother's coping behavior were found to be significant in explaining 47% of the variance in parental stress. We hope that these data will help clinical health care providers in fostering more effective strategies of health care in asthma of children and mother.

AB  - The Early Childhood Asthma Project involved asthma case identification in 35 Head Start centers in Detroit, MI, and attempted implementation of an intervention designed to help families manage a child's asthma more effectively. Surveys were distributed to the parents of all Head Start children (3408), and 2198 complete surveys were returned. Case detection found probable asthma in 30% of the children whose parent returned a sufficiently complete survey. Implementation of the intervention was unsuccessful in this setting. Obstacles to effective implementation included the sample's low participation and high attrition, limited involvement of Head Start personnel, factors related to the program approach, and the target population's beliefs about asthma.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Spirometry is an important component of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines for asthma, yet published data show variable associations between forced expiratory volume in 1 second percentage (FEV1%) predicted, symptoms and health care utilization. The objective of this analysis was to examine the association between FEV1% and future risk of exacerbations among a well-characterized population of children with asthma. METHODS: Using data that are available from the Childhood Asthma Management Program, we examined the relationship between prebronchodilator FEV1% and important clinical outcomes. Multiple observations of FEV1 were available for each patient; multivariate regression analysis, using a general estimating equation approach, was used to control for the correlation between repeated measurements among individuals and potential confounders. FEV1% was categorized into 4 levels and as a continuous variable. Outcomes of interest included mean symptom score (0-3), episode-free days, and asthma-related events (oral steroid use, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations) during the ensuing 4-month period. Our analysis was limited to the placebo group (N = 417). RESULTS: We observed a clear relationship between prebronchodilator FEV1% and important clinical outcomes. In multivariable models that simultaneously controlled for covariates of interest, age at baseline, time, previous event history, and nocturnal awakenings, a significant relationship between FEV1% and asthma symptoms and serious asthma exacerbations (oral steroids, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations) was observed. Compared with children with an FEV1% > or = 100%, children with FEV1% 80% to 99%, 60% to 79%, and < 60% were 1.3, 1.8, and 4.8, respectively, more likely to have a serious asthma exacerbation during the ensuing 4 months. CONCLUSIONS. In children with mild to moderate asthma, FEV1% predicted is independently associated with future asthma symptoms and health care utilization. Previous asthma-related hospitalizations and nocturnal symptoms also were independently associated with risk for future adverse events. FEV1 is an important component of asthma health status and asthma severity classification.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthma is a major public health problem of increasing concern in the United States. Low-income populations, minorities, and children living in inner cities experience disproportionately higher morbidity and mortality due to asthma. In 1991, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease at the National Institutes of Health funded the National Cooperative Inner-City Asthma Study (NCICAS), the foundation for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-funded Inner-City Asthma Intervention (ICAI) on which the tool kit discussed in this article is based. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the purpose and content of a tool kit for health care organizations that wish to enhance their asthma management efforts and to improve the quality of life of children with asthma and their families. METHODS: The ICAI was tailored to the individual child and family through a combination of group and individual activities (core) and follow-up. Information contained in the tool kit is based on project reports, tracking and data collection reports, program oversight activity, and general subject matter knowledge. RESULTS: Although the NCICAS proved successful, moving from a research design to the real world of implementation was difficult. The tool kit draws on the experience of implementation and provides strategies, options, and considerations for health care organizations to use in tailoring project activities. CONCLUSION: The ICAI demonstrated that committed health care organizations, with trained and experienced individuals, could help empower children and families to manage childhood asthma. The tool kit was designed to share the best practices and lessons learned from the ICAI implementation of the NCICAS protocol at the community level.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The prevalence of asthma and allergic disorders in childhood is increasing in many parts of the world. This review focuses on recent findings with regard to environmental risk factors and their manipulation in the primary prevention of these diseases in childhood. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have failed to resolve the controversy on the subject of exposure to indoor aeroallergens and the risk of sensitization and asthma in childhood. Bronchiolitis due to respiratory syncytial virus in infancy is associated with a significant increase in risk of asthma, but not atopy. In the prevention of these diseases, the effects of breastfeeding are controversial, with studies showing a protective effect in children without allergic predisposition, but other studies showing no effect or even the potential for an increased asthma risk. A significant reduction in the prevalence of doctor-diagnosed asthma at 7 years was found in a randomized controlled multifaceted (reduction of inhaled and ingested allergens) intervention study of high-risk infants. Other intervention measures, such as an education program on how to reduce exposure, the use of probiotics, and immunization against infections, all showed some protective effects. SUMMARY: More research is required, especially with regard to longer periods of follow-up for all current intervention studies aimed at reducing exposure, the onset and duration of intervention, and other novel intervention measures in the primary prevention of asthma and allergic diseases in childhood.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To report on recent studies on the effect of inhaled corticosteroids on pulmonary function in young children with asthma. RECENT FINDINGS: Inhaled corticosteroids are considered the most effective treatment for persistent asthma in children. Appropriate control of childhood asthma may prevent more serious disease or irreversible obstruction in later years. While some authors have described an improvement with the use of inhaled corticosteroids in young children, others found no clinical or functional benefit. Various studies have shown that inhaled corticosteroids ameliorate clinical outcomes, and recently a study demonstrated improvement in pulmonary function in young children with asthma. The use of different study designs may explain the lack of consistent results and disagreement regarding the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids in these patients. SUMMARY: Based on the preponderance of evidence, treatment with inhaled corticosteroids in infants and young children with recurrent wheeze and risk factors of developing asthma appears to allow better control of the illness and improve the pulmonary function.

AB  - A short cut review was carried out to establish whether adding inhaled anti-cholinergics to beta-agonists improves outcome in the treatment of acute childhood asthma. 148 papers were found using the reported searches, of which one presented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of this best paper is tabulated. It is concluded that anti-cholinergics reduce time to recovery and discharge and may reduce admissions for moderate to severe groups.

AB  - Asthma is now the leading cause of emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and missed school days in New York City's poorest neighbourhoods. While most research focuses on the influence of the indoor environment on asthma, this study examines the neighbourhood effects on childhood asthma, such as housing and ambient environmental hazards. Using Geographic Information Science (GI Science) we identify neighbourhoods with elevated concentrations of childhood asthma hospitalizations between 1997 and 2000 in US census tracts, analyze the sociodemographic, housing characteristics, and air pollution burdens from stationary, land use and mobile sources in these areas. The paper reveals the importance of distinguishing the specific and often different combinations of poor housing conditions, outdoor air pollution and noxious land uses that contribute to the high incidence of asthma in impoverished urban neighbourhoods.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine differences in asthma prevalence and emergency department (ED) visits for asthma between non-Hispanic black and white children, and factors that might explain those differences, in a large, nationally representative sample covering the period 1997 to 2003. METHODS: Bivariate and multivariate regression analyses (with logit and multinomial logit methods) were conducted with a sample consisting of all non-Hispanic black and white children (< 18 years of age) from the 1997 to 2003 rounds of the National Health Interview Survey. Models included a progressively larger set of controls for factors that might explain racial differences in asthma prevalence and ED visits for asthma. RESULTS: Being black was associated with a greater likelihood of currently having asthma and with a greater likelihood of having gone to the ED for asthma treatment in the past 1 year. Elevated asthma risks for black children were robust after controlling for a host of child and family characteristics that might explain them. CONCLUSIONS: Black children are more likely to have asthma and to experience ED visits for asthma, compared with otherwise comparable white children, and these racial disparities cannot be explained by differences in measurable child or family characteristics. These results suggest that racial disparities in asthma continue to pose risks for black children, and they point to the need for additional research into potential explanations and remedies.

AB  - Rationale: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) mediates a spectrum of airway inflammatory responses, including those to air pollutants, and is an asthma candidate gene. One TNF promoter variant (G-308A) affects expression of TNF and has been associated with inflammatory diseases; however, studies of asthma have been inconsistent. Because ozone produces oxidative stress, increased airway TNF, and inflammation, the associations of the -308 TNF polymorphism with asthma may vary by ozone exposure and variants of oxidant defense genes glutathione-S-transferase (GST) M1 and GSTP1.Objectives: To investigate the association of TNF G-308A with asthma and wheezing and to determine whether these associations vary with ozone exposure and GSTM1 and GSTP1 genotype.Methods: We studied associations of TNF-308 genotype with lifetime and current wheezing and asthma among 3,699 children in the Children's Health Study. We examined differences in associations with community ozone and by GSTM1 null and GSTP1 105 Ile/Val (A105G) genotype.Results: Children with TNF-308 GG had decreased risk of asthma (odds ratio, 0.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.7-0.9) and lifetime wheezing (odds ratio, 0.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.7-0.9). The protective effects of GG genotype on wheezing outcomes were of greater magnitude in lower compared with higher ozone communities. These findings were replicated in the two cohorts of fourth-grade children recruited in 1993 and 1996. The reduction of the protective effect from the -308 GG genotype with higher ozone exposure was most marked in the GSTM1 null and GSTP1 Ile/Ile groups.Conclusions: The TNF-308 GG genotype may have a protective role in asthma pathogenesis, depending on airway oxidative stress levels.

AB  - PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to assess the relationship between hospitalization rates and asthma prevalence in New York City children and investigate the role that sociodemographic factors play in asthma. METHODS: A parent-report questionnaire was distributed in 26 randomly selected New York City public elementary schools, stratified according to neighborhood hospitalization rates. RESULTS: The overall student response rate was 76.9% (5250 students). Prevalence of current asthma was 17.9%, 9.59%, 6.39% (p < .001) in areas of high, median, and low asthma hospitalization rates, respectively. The overall prevalence of current asthma was 13.0%. Children living in predominantly low socioeconomic status (SES) communities had a 70% greater risk of current asthma, independent of their own ethnicity and income level. Asthma prevalence within different ethnic and income groups was consistently lower in neighborhoods of greater socioeconomic status, except among Puerto Rican children, who had high asthma prevalence, regardless of school attended or income. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of current asthma is strongly associated with attending a school in a low-income neighborhood. Although hospitalization rates have been used as an indicator of the burden of asthma in a neighborhood, it alone does not reflect the level of disparities that exist among communities with different socioeconomic backgrounds.

AB  - PURPOSE: A growing body of evidence indicates that perinatal factors modulate immune development and thereby may affect childhood asthma risk. In this study, we examined the associations between birth by cesarean section (C-section) and atopic disease occurrence in childhood. METHODS: Subjects were born in California between 1975 and 1987 and were 8 to 17 years old during their enrollment in the Children's Health Study. Our analysis was restricted to 3464 children born at or after 37 weeks of gestation with a birth weight of 2500 g or greater based on birth certificate data. Information about sociodemographic factors, reported physician-diagnosed asthma, and other atopic diseases was obtained by using a self-administered structured questionnaire. Logistic regression models were fitted to compute odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Children born by C-section were at increased risk for asthma (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.01-1.75), hay fever (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.24-1.99), and allergy (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.03-1.53) compared with those born vaginally. Risk associated with C-section was the same for children regardless of family history of asthma or allergy. CONCLUSION: We conclude that birth by C-section or processes associated with it may increase the risk for atopic disease in childhood.

AB  - Results from studies of traffic and childhood asthma have been inconsistent, but there has been little systematic evaluation of susceptible subgroups. In this study, we examined the relationship of local traffic-related exposure and asthma and wheeze in southern California school children (5-7 years of age). Lifetime history of doctor-diagnosed asthma and prevalent asthma and wheeze were evaluated by questionnaire. Parental history of asthma and child's history of allergic symptoms, sex, and early-life exposure (residence at the same home since 2 years of age) were examined as susceptibility factors. Residential exposure was assessed by proximity to a major road and by modeling exposure to local traffic-related pollutants. Residence within 75 m of a major road was associated with an increased risk of lifetime asthma [odds ratio (OR) = 1.29 ; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-1.86], prevalent asthma (OR = 1.50 ; 95% CI, 1.16-1.95), and wheeze (OR = 1.40 ; 95% CI, 1.09-1.78). Susceptibility increased in long-term residents with no parental history of asthma for lifetime asthma (OR = 1.85 ; 95% CI, 1.11-3.09), prevalent asthma (OR = 2.46 ; 95% CI, 0.48-4.09), and recent wheeze (OR = 2.74 ; 95% CI, 1.71-4.39). The higher risk of asthma near a major road decreased to background rates at 150-200 m from the road. In children with a parental history of asthma and in children moving to the residence after 2 years of age, there was no increased risk associated with exposure. Effect of residential proximity to roadways was also larger in girls. A similar pattern of effects was observed with traffic-modeled exposure. These results indicate that residence near a major road is associated with asthma. The reason for larger effects in those with no parental history of asthma merits further investigation. Key words: air pollution, asthma, child, epidemiology, traffic.

AB  - This study tested the relationship of anxiety and asthma severity to symptom perception. Eighty-six children diagnosed with mild or moderate asthma had symptom perception and pulmonary function measured throughout methacholine challenge (to induce bronchoconstriction). Higher trait anxiety was associated with heightened symptom perception (controlling for pulmonary function) at baseline. Greater asthma severity was associated with blunted symptom perception (controlling for pulmonary function) at the end of methacholine challenge and with a slower rate of increase in symptom perception across methacholine challenge. These results suggest that anxiety plays a role when children's symptoms are mild, whereas medical variables such as severity play a role in perception of changes in asthma symptomatology as bronchoconstriction worsens.

AB  - OBJECTIVES. To describe the development and evaluation of a pilot emergency department (ED)-based asthma surveillance system for childhood asthma visits based on billing data and to illustrate how the data can be used to document trends and patterns in ED visits for asthma in children.METHODS. During 2001 and 2002, aggregate reports based on ED billing data from 3 hospitals in western Michigan were obtained from a single physician billing company. Data were tabulated and graphed to show trends in the monthly number of ED visits for asthma in children. Comparisons were made by age, gender, and site. We evaluated the system by using established guidelines.RESULTS. The data illustrated strong seasonal trends, as well as marked differences in ED use according to age and gender. The total numbers of asthma ED visits were remarkably similar between the 2 years evaluated; however, the timing and duration of the seasonal peaks differed. Our evaluation of the system found that it met many of the characteristics that define successful surveillance systems, including simplicity, flexibility, acceptability, sensitivity and positive predictive value, timeliness, and stability. However, the surveillance system's representativeness was limited by the inability to calculate valid population-based ED-visit rates. Despite this limitation, the data provided useful information by documenting the burden and demographic profile of children who use the ED for asthma care and in identifying seasonal and time-related trends.CONCLUSIONS. We were able to successfully implement a pilot ED-based surveillance system for childhood asthma visits by using billing data. This system promotes the understanding of the burden of asthma among children visiting the ED. The development of an ED-based surveillance system for childhood asthma visits using billing data is recommended, particularly when there is a desire to understand the characteristics of children with asthma who use the ED and/or a need to understand the impact of local asthma quality-improvement programs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES. The Hawaii Child Asthma Research to Elevate Standards (CARES) Program implemented an emergency department (ED)-based education and management program to facilitate National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guideline understanding among asthmatic children and their families, ED staff, and health care providers.METHODS. The multipronged approach used: (1) 2-phased prospective tracking system of ED asthma patients; (2) ED-based educational intervention for patients/families; and (3) asthma education for ED staff and community-based health care providers. Data were collected across 4 EDs during phase I (October 8, 2002, to October 1, 2003) and phase II (October 1, 2003, to July 8, 2004). Follow-up data were collected by telephone 3 weeks (phase I), and 3 weeks and 3 months (phase II) after the ED encounter. The patient/family intervention was delivered throughout phase II. During phase I, ED and community-based health care professionals developed strategies for building an integrated asthma care system. ED staff training was delivered before phase II. Continuing medical education for health care providers was delivered before and during the first month of phase II.RESULTS. Tracking data on 706 phase I and 353 phase II patient encounters revealed that the majority of patients with persistent asthma did not use long-term controller medications and did not possess a written asthma action plan. From preintervention to postintervention, the number of patients possessing a written asthma action plan increased from 48 to 322. Of 186 persistent asthmatics, 34 were using controller medications daily, 34 as needed, and 118 not at all. Daily use increased to 80 3 weeks postintervention and to 68 3 months postintervention.CONCLUSION. An ED-based childhood asthma tracking system can serve as a basis for designing and implementing an ED-based educational intervention. ED staff, primary care providers, and others can work together to promote asthma care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Montelukast is a widely used controller agent in childhood asthma. It is modestly effective in reducing symptoms, decreasing the need for rescue albuterol, and improving forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). OBJECTIVE: To determine whether montelukast therapy improves peripheral airway obstruction as measured by lung volumes, air trapping, airway resistance (Raw), and specific conductance (Sgaw). METHODS: Twenty-one children aged 9 to 18 years with mild-to-moderate asthma were randomized into a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to receive montelukast (5 or 10 mg) or matching placebo daily for 8 weeks. Symptoms and albuterol use were recorded twice daily, and exhaled nitric oxide measurement, forced oscillometry, spirometry, and body box plethysmography (before and after beta-agonist use) were performed at randomization and at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks. Circulating eosinophil counts and serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) levels were obtained at randomization and at 8 weeks. RESULTS: Montelukast-treated patients had lower residual volume (P = .05), residual volume-total lung capacity ratio (P = .04), Raw (P = .02), Sgaw (P = .03), and serum ECP levels (P = .02) at 8 weeks compared with those treated with placebo. There was a trend toward reduced daytime and nighttime albuterol use, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. There were no significant differences in FEV1, FEV1-forced vital capacity ratio, exhaled nitric oxide levels, or daytime and nighttime symptom scores between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Montelukast therapy was associated with less air trapping, hyperinflation, and Raw and better Sgaw compared with placebo. Lower serum ECP levels, a surrogate measure of airway inflammation, were associated with improvements in lung function.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The focus in managing asthma has undergone a paradigm shift from the concept of assessing severity to assessing control. The recent Practice Parameter on attaining optimal asthma control highlights the need to titrate the step-care management of asthma to the level of control assessed at each clinic encounter. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent advances in the monitoring of asthma control in children include the use of questionnaires such as the Childhood Asthma Control Test, use of biomarkers such as fractional concentration of exhaled nitric oxide, sophisticated hand-held electronic monitoring of lung function such as peak flow and forced expiratory volume, indicators of lung growth and bronchial hyper-responsiveness such as post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume, outcomes-utilization data, markers of atopy, and electronic measures of adherence. SUMMARY: Three recent proof-of-concept studies in adults have demonstrated the relevance of criteria other than guidelines-recommended asthma symptoms and pulmonary function tests. These studies used airway hyper-responsiveness, sputum eosinophilia, and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide as indices to facilitate fine-tuning of asthma control and use of controller-inhaled steroids. The next logical step would be to determine the applicability of these and other measures to children in both research and clinical settings.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the association between antibiotic exposure in the first year of life and the development of childhood asthma. DESIGN: Metaanalysis of observational studies retrieved through systematic search of all available electronic data sources. Studies included in the metaanalyses were those with populations exposed to one or more courses of antibiotics during the first year of life, and asthma diagnosis was defined as diagnosis by a physician between the age of 1 to 18 years. SETTING: Retrospective and prospective studies published in the English-language literature from 1966 to present. RESULTS: Eight studies (four prospective and four retrospective) examined the association between exposure to at least one course of antibiotics and development of childhood asthma. The total number of subjects for the analysis comparing exposure to at least one antibiotic to no exposure in the first year of life was 12,082 children and 1,817 asthma cases. In the dose-response analysis, we included data from a total of 27,167 children and 3,392 asthma cases. The pooled odds ratio (OR) for the eight studies was 2.05 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.41 to 2.99). The association was significantly stronger in the retrospective studies (OR, 2.82; 95% CI, 2.07 to 3.85) than the prospective studies (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.42). Five of the eight studies examined whether the association was related to the number of courses of antibiotics taken in the first year of life. The overall OR for the dose-response analysis was 1.16 (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.28) for each additional course of antibiotics; however, this association was not significantly stronger in the retrospective studies (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.60) relative to the prospective studies (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.20). CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to at least one course of antibiotics in the first year of life appears to be a risk factor for the development of childhood asthma. Because of the limitations of the studies conducted to date, additional large-scale, prospective studies are needed to confirm this potential association.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The optimal treatment for early childhood asthma remains controversial. Budesonide (BUD) has shown superiority over placebo in infants, and over disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) in children aged > 2 years. The aim of this double-blind, randomised, parallel-group study was to compare the effectiveness of nebulised BUD and DSCG in asthmatic children aged < 36 months.Research design and methods: 82 infants (mean age 18.0 months [range, 11.6-31.2 months]) with suspected asthma (three exacerbations of dyspnoea and wheezing during the past 12 months, with one or more exacerbations in the past 3 months) were treated for 3 months with nebulised BUD (Pulmicort Respules) 0.5 mg/2 mL bid or DSCG 20 mg/2 mL tid. Follow-up was at 6 months.Main outcome measures and results: Patients treated with BUD had a lower exacerbation rate than DSCG-treated patients after 3 months of treatment (5.4% vs. 31.7%; p = 0.003) and towards the end of follow-up (30% vs. 49%; p = 0.062). During treatment, days without cough were 80% and 65% for BUD and DSCG, respectively (p = 0.014), and nights without cough were 89% and 78%, respectively (p = 0.016). Side-effects were mild and of similar frequency in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: Inhaled nebulised BUD was well tolerated and more effective than nebulised DSCG in reducing the incidence of asthma exacerbations and days with symptoms. These beneficial effects of BUD were maintained throughout the 6-month follow-up.

AB  - Objective: This study investigates whether racial/ethnic disparities in childhood asthma prevalence can be explained by differences in family and neighborhood socioeconomic position (SEP).Methods: Data were from the 2001 Rhode Island Health Interview Survey (RI HIS), a statewide representative sample of 2,600 Rhode Island households, and the 2000 U.S. Census. A series of weighted multivariate models were fitted using generalized estimating equations (GEE) for the logistic case to analyze the independent and joint effects of race/ethnicity and SEP on doctor-diagnosed asthma among 1,769 white, black and Hispanic children <18 years old.Results: Compared with white children, black children were at increased odds for asthma and this effect persisted when measures of family and neighborhood SEP were included in multivariate models (AOR: 2.49; 95% Cl: 1.30-4.77). Black children living in poverty neighborhoods had substantially higher odds of asthma than Hispanic and white children in poverty areas and children in moderate- and high-income neighborhoods (AOR: 3.20: 95% Cl: 1.62-6.29).Conclusion: The high prevalence of asthma among black children in poor neighborhoods is consistent with previous research on higher-than-average prevalence of childhood asthma in poor urban minority communities. Changing neighborhood social structures that contribute to racial disparities in asthma prevalence remains a challenge.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have suggested a relationship between childhood asthma and behavior problems. However, few studies have used community-based samples to assess the prevalence of behavior problems among urban children with asthma symptoms. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between asthma symptoms and behavior among a population-based sample of inner-city children and to determine the prevalence of behavioral comorbidity among children with asthma symptoms. METHODS: In 2003, parents of children who were entering kindergarten in the city of Rochester completed a detailed survey regarding the child's background, medical history (with specific questions about asthma symptoms), and behavior. We compared children with no asthma symptoms, intermittent symptoms, and persistent symptoms with regard to positive peer social skills (eg, makes friends easily), negative peer social skills (eg, fights with other children), task orientation (eg, concentrates well), and shy/anxious behavior (eg, is withdrawn) (validated scales; range: 1-4). We used multivariate regression to determine the independent association between symptom severity and behavioral outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1619 children were included (response rate: 80%; mean age: 5.1 year), and 15% had asthma symptoms (8% persistent, 7% intermittent). Average negative peer scores were worse for children with persistent asthma symptoms compared with children with intermittent and no symptoms (mean scores: 1.88, 1.70, and 1.65). Children with persistent symptoms also scored worse than children with no symptoms on the assessment of task orientation (2.85 vs 3.03) and shy/anxious behavior (2.11 vs 1.89). Among children with persistent asthma symptoms, >20% scored >1 SD below average on 2 or more scales, compared with 16% of children with intermittent symptoms and 10% with no symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Urban children with persistent asthma symptoms demonstrate more behavior problems across several domains compared with children with no symptoms. These findings suggest a clear need for an early biopsychosocial approach to care for vulnerable children with asthma.

AB  - Rationale: T-bet (TBX21 or T-box 21) is a critical regulator of T-helper 1 lineage commitment and IFN-gamma production. Knockout mice lacking T-bet develop airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to methacholine, peribronchial eosinophilic and lymphocytic inflammation, and increased type III collagen deposition below the bronchial epithelium basement membrane, reminiscent of both acute and chronic asthma histopathology. Little is known regarding the role of genetic variation surrounding T-bet in the development of human AHR.Objectives: To assess the relationship between T-bet polymorphisms and asthma-related phenotypes using family-based association.Methods: Single nucleotide polymorphism discovery was performed by resequencing the T-bet genomic locus in 30 individuals (including 22 patients with asthma). Sixteen variants were genotyped in 580 nuclear families ascertained through offspring with asthma from the Childhood Asthma Management Program clinical trial. Haplotype patterns were determined from this genotype data. Family-based tests of association were performed with asthma, AHR, lung function, total serum immunoglobulin E, and blood eosinophil levels.Main Results: We identified 24 variants. Evidence of association was observed between c.-7947 and asthma in white families using both additive (p = 0.02) or dominant models (p = 0.006). c.-7947 and three other variants were also associated with AHR (log-methacholine PC(20), p = 0.02-0.04). Haplotype analysis suggested that an AHR locus is in linkage disequilibrium with variants in the 3'UTR. Evidence of association of AHR with c.-7947, but not with other 3'UTR SNPs, was replicated in an independent cohort of adult males with AHR.Conclusions: These data suggest that T-bet variation contributes to airway responsiveness in asthma.

AB  - Allergies and food reactions are common and may be associated with foods including adapted cow's milk formula. Formulas containing hydrolysed proteins have been used to treat infants with allergy or food intolerance. However, it is unclear whether hydrolysed formula can be advocated for prevention of allergy and food intolerance in infants without evidence of allergy or food intolerance. To determine the effect of feeding hydrolysed formulas on allergy and food intolerance in infants and children compared to adapted cow's milk or human breast milk. If hydrolysed formulas are effective, to determine what type of hydrolysed formula is most effective including extensively and partially hydrolysed formulas. To determine which infants benefit, including infants at low or high risk of allergy and infants receiving early, short term or prolonged formula feeding. The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. The review was updated with searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (1966-March 2006), EMBASE (1980-March 2006) and CINAHL (1982-March 2006) and previous reviews including cross references. Randomised and quasi-randomised trials that compare the use of a hydrolysed infant formula to human milk or cow's milk formula. Trials with >80% follow up of participants were eligible for inclusion. Eligibility of studies for inclusion, methodological quality and data extraction were assessed independently by each review author. Primary outcomes included clinical allergy, specific allergies and food intolerance. Meta-analysis was conducted using a fixed effects model. Two trials compared early, short term hydrolysed formula to human milk feeding. No significant difference in infant allergy or childhood cow's milk allergy (CMA) were reported. No eligible trial compared prolonged hydrolysed formula to human milk feeding. Two trials compared early, short term hydrolysed formula to cow's milk formula feeding. No significant benefits were reported. One large quasi-random study reported a reduction in infant CMA of borderline significance in low risk infants (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.38, 1.00). Ten eligible studies compared prolonged feeding with hydrolysed formula versus cow's milk formula in high risk infants. Meta-analysis found a significant reduction in infant allergy (seven studies, 2514 infants; typical RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66, 0.94), but not in the incidence of childhood allergy (two studies, 950 infants; typical RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69, 1.05). There was no significant difference in infant eczema (eight studies, 2558 infants, typical RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.68, 1.04), childhood eczema incidence (two studies, 950 infants, typical RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.63, 1.10), childhood eczema prevalence (one study, 872 infants; RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.43, 1.02), or infant or childhood asthma, rhinitis and food allergy. One study reported a significant reduction in infants with CMA with confirmed atopy (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.15, 0.89). Subgroup analysis of trials blinded to formula found no significant difference in infant allergy (four studies, 2156 infants; typical RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.69, 1.08) or childhood allergy incidence (one study, 872 infants; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.73, 1.14). No eligible trial examined the effect of prolonged hydrolysed formula feeding on allergy beyond early childhood. There is evidence that preterm or low birthweight infants fed a hydrolysed preterm formula have significantly reduced weight gain, but not in other growth parameters (head circumference or length). Studies in term infants report no adverse effects on growth. Subgroup analysis of trials of partially hydrolysed versus cow's milk formula found a significant reduction in infant allergy (six studies, 1391 infants; typical RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65, 0.97) but not childhood allergy, or infant or childhood asthma, eczema or rhinitis. Methodological concerns were the same as for the overall analysis. Analysis of trials of extensively hydrolysed formula versus cow's milk formula found no significant differences in allergy or food intolerance. Infants fed extensively hydrolysed formula compared with partially hydrolysed formula had a significant reduction in food allergy (two studies, 341 infants; typical RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.19, 0.99), but there was no significant difference in all allergy or any other specific allergy incidence. Comparing extensively hydrolysed casein containing formula with cow's milk formula, one study (431 infants) reported a significant reduction in childhood allergy incidence (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53, 0.97). Meta-analysis found a significant reduction in infant eczema (three studies, 1237 infants; typical RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.51, 0.97). One study reported a significant reduction in childhood eczema incidence (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.44, 0.98) and prevalence (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.27, 0.92). There is no evidence to support feeding with a hydrolysed formula for the prevention of allergy compared to exclusive breast feeding. In high risk infants who are unable to be completely breast fed, there is limited evidence that prolonged feeding with a hydrolysed formula compared to a cow's milk formula reduces infant and childhood allergy and infant CMA. In view of methodological concerns and inconsistency of findings, further large, well designed trials comparing formulas containing partially hydrolysed whey, or extensively hydrolysed casein to cow's milk formulas are needed.[CINAHL Note: The Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews contain interactive software that allows various calculations in the MetaView.]

AB  - Currently inhaled corticosteroids are the main stay in the maintenance treatment of chronic asthma in children. Although inhaled corticosteroids play a crucial role in the management of childhood asthma, the long-term side effects of inhaled corticosteroids used in the management of chronic asthma in children are not clearly known. The objective of this review is to compare the safety and efficacy of inhaled nedocromil sodium with placebo in the treatment of chronic asthma in children. We searched the Cochrane airway group trials register, Cochrane controlled trials register, Current contents, review articles, reference lists of articles. We also contacted the drug manufacturer and primary authors for additional citations. We also searched abstracts of major respiratory society meetings. The last search was carried out in October 2004 Randomised placebo controlled trials comparing nedocromil sodium to placebo in the treatment of chronic asthma in children (0 to 18 years). Both authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Fifteen trials (twelve parallel group studies; three crossover trials recruiting 1422 children (837 males and 585 females)) were included. The studies were generally of good methodological quality. Two large long term studies used nedocromil for six months and four to six years and showed conflicting results in symptom free days. Short term studies (duration between 4 weeks to 12 weeks) showed that nedocromil sodium produced some improvement in a number of efficacy measures compared to placebo including FEV(1), FVC, FEV(1) % predicted, PC20 FEV(1), evening PEF and symptom scores. The parent's assessment of efficacy was in favour of nedocromil (odds ratio (OR) 0.5 (95% CI 0.3 to 0.8). Nedocromil sodium has a good safety profile. The only significant side effect observed was unpleasant taste. There was little evidence for a clinically dose response effect and only a few studies recruited participants with severe asthma. A limited number of small studies have shown that nedocromil is of benefit in improving lung function and some measures of symptoms, but the evidence with regard to the primary outcome of the review was conflicting. Two long-term trials did not show consistent effects on lung function outcomes, whereas several small short-term trials have shown benefit in these outcomes. Differing severities at baseline may explain this difference with milder participants experiencing less benefit, although the discrepancy between study findings may also reflect publication bias. Nedocromil sodium is associated with a very good safety profile with no significant short term or long- term adverse side effects. Although nedocromil may have advantages over inhaled corticosteroids in terms of side effects, there is a need for head to head trials of nedocromil and inhaled corticosteroids to establish whether asthma control is similar, especially in mild asthma. It is not yet clear where nedocromil should sit in relation to other therapies in the treatment of asthma in children.[CINAHL Note: The Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews contain interactive software that allows various calculations in the MetaView.]

AB  - Xanthines have been used in the treatment of asthma as a bronchodilator, though they may also have anti-inflammatory effects. The current role of xanthines in the long-term treatment of childhood asthma needs to be reassessed. To determine the efficacy of xanthines (e.g. theophylline) in the maintenance treatment of paediatric asthma. A search of the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register was undertaken with predefined search terms. Searches are current to May 2005. Randomised controlled trials,lasting at least four weeks comparing a xanthine with placebo, regular short-acting beta-agonist (SABA), inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), cromoglycate (SCG), ketotifen (KET) or leukotriene antagonist, in children with diagnosed with chronic asthma between 18 months and 18 years old. Two reviewers independently selected each study for inclusion in the review and extracted data. Primary outcome was percentage of symptom-free days. Thirty-four studies (2734 participants) of adequate quality were included. Xanthine versus placebo (17 studies): The proportion of symptom free days was larger with xanthine compared with placebo (7.97% [95% CI 3.41, 12.53]). Rescue medication usage was lower with xanthine, with no significant difference in symptom scores or hospitalisations. FEV1 , and PEF were better with xanthine. Xanthine was associated with non - specific side-effects. Data from behavioural scores were inconclusive. Xanthine versus ICS (four studies) : Exacerbations were less frequent with ICS, but no significant difference on lung function was observed. Individual studies reported significant improvements in symptom measures in favour of steroids, and one study reported a difference in growth rate in favour of xanthine. No difference was observed for study withdrawal or tremor. Xanthine was associated with more frequent headache and nausea. Xanthine versus regular SABA (10 studies): No significant difference in symptoms, rescue medication usage and spirometry. Individual studies reported improvement in PEF with beta-agonist. Beta-agonist treatment led to fewer hospitalisations and headaches. Xanthine was associated with less tremor. Xanthine versus SCG (six studies ): No significant difference in symptoms, exacerbations and rescue medication. Sodium cromoglycate was associated with fewer gastro-intestinal side-effects than xanthine. Xanthine versus KET (one study): No statistical tests of significance between xanthine and ketotifen were reported. Xanthine + ICS versus placebo + same dose ICS (three studies) : Results were conflicting due to clinical/methodological differences, and could not be aggregated. Xanthines as first-line preventer alleviate symptoms and reduce requirement for rescue medication in children with mild to moderate asthma. When compared with ICS they were less effective in preventing exacerbations. Xanthines had similar efficacy as single preventative agent compared with regular SABA and SCG. Evidence on AEs (adverse effects) was equivocal: there was evidence for increased AEs overall, but no evidence that any specific AE (including effects on behaviour and attention) occurred more frequently than with placebo. There is insufficient evidence from available studies to make firm conclusions about the effectiveness of xanthines as add-on preventative treatment to ICS, and there are no published paediatric studies comparing xanthines with alternatives in this role. Our data suggest that xanthines are only suitable as first-line preventative asthma therapy in children when ICS are not available. They may have a role as add-on therapy in more severe asthma not controlled by ICS, but further studies are needed to examine this, and to define the risk-benefit ratio compared with other agents.[CINAHL Note: The Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews contain interactive software that allows various calculations in the MetaView.]

AB  - Allergies and food reactions in infants and children are common and may be associated with a variety of foods including adapted cow's milk formula. Soy based formulas have been used to treat infants with allergy or food intolerance. However, it is unclear whether they can help prevent allergy and food intolerance in infants without clinical evidence of allergy or food intolerance. To determine the effect of feeding adapted soy formula compared to human milk, cow's milk formula or a hydrolysed protein formula on preventing allergy or food intolerance in infants without clinical evidence of allergy or food intolerance. The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. Updated searches were performed of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (1966-March 2006), EMBASE (1980-March 2006), CINAHL (1982-March 2006) and previous reviews including cross references. Randomised and quasi-randomised trials that compare the use of an adapted soy formula to human milk, an adapted cow's milk or a hydrolysed protein formula for feeding infants without clinical allergy or food intolerance in the first six months of life. Only trials with > 80% follow up of participants and reported in group of assignment were eligible for inclusion. Eligibility of studies for inclusion, methodological quality and data extraction were assessed independently by each review author. Primary outcomes included clinical allergy, specific allergies and food intolerance. Where no heterogeneity of treatment effect was found, the fixed effect model was used for meta-analysis. Where significant or apparent heterogeneity was found, results were reported using the random effects model and potential causes of the heterogeneity were sought. Three eligible studies enrolling high risk infants with a history of allergy in a first degree relative were included. No eligible study enrolled infants fed human milk. No study examined the effect of early, short term soy formula feeding. All compared prolonged soy formula to cow's milk formula feeding. One study was of adequate methodology and without unbalanced allergy preventing co-interventions in treatment groups. One study with unclear allocation concealment and 19.5% losses reported a significant reduction in infant allergy, asthma and allergic rhinitis. However, no other study reported any significant benefits from the use of a soy formula. Meta-analysis found no significant difference in childhood allergy incidence (2 studies; typical RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.37, 1.44). No significant difference was reported in one study in infant asthma (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.86, 1.40), infant eczema (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.95, 1.52), childhood eczema prevalence (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.73, 1.68), infant rhinitis (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.76, 1.16) or childhood rhinitis prevalence (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.73, 2.00). Meta-analysis found no significant difference in childhood asthma incidence (3 studies, 728 infants; typical RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.26, 1.92), childhood eczema incidence (2 studies, 283 infants; typical RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.90, 2.75) or childhood rhinitis incidence (2 studies, 283 infants; typical RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.06, 8.00). One study reported no significant difference in infant CMPI (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.45, 2.62), infant CMA (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.24, 4.86), childhood soy protein allergy incidence (RR 3.26, 95% CI 0.36, 29.17) and urticaria. No study compared soy formula to hydrolysed protein formula. Feeding with a soy formula cannot be recommended for prevention of allergy or food intolerance in infants at high risk of allergy or food intolerance. Further research may be warranted to determine the role of soy formulas for prevention of allergy or food intolerance in infants unable to be breast fed with a strong family history of allergy or cow's milk protein intolerance.[CINAHL Note: The Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews contain interactive software that allows various calculations in the MetaView.]

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the diagnostic accuracy of lung function measurements made using spirometry for childhood asthma, recent guidelines for the measurement and interpretation of spirometric lung function tests and recent developments for diagnosing asthma. RECENT FINDINGS: Measurements of lung function and bronchial lability made using spirometry may not perform any better than other tests such as skin prick testing, or measurements of exhaled nitric oxide for diagnosing asthma. New guidelines are available. SUMMARY: Spirometry is a simple, robust and widely available tool for investigating lung function. There are published guidelines for making measurements and their interpretation. The place of spirometry in the diagnosis of asthma, however, needs clarification. The diagnostic profiles of measurements of bronchodilator responsiveness and bronchial hyperreactivity made using spirometry, although reasonable, are not perfect. In schoolchildren, they are no better than knowledge of aeroallergen sensitization when considering a diagnosis of asthma.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There still is no cure for asthma. Early identification of patients at risk for disease progression may lead to better treatment opportunities and hopefully better disease outcomes in adulthood. Recent literature on childhood risk factors associated with the outcome of asthma in adulthood is reviewed. RECENT FINDINGS: The role of sex and smoking on the outcome of childhood asthma is still uncertain. Better lung function in childhood is consistently associated with better prognosis in adulthood, whereas the severity of bronchial hyperresponsiveness is not a good predictor of asthma outcome. Childhood atopy is associated with the persistence of symptoms but not with lung function in adulthood. An important finding is that anti-inflammatory treatment can reduce the accelerated decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 s and airway remodelling, but there is considerable variety in treatment response between individuals, which possibly can be explained by genetic make-up. Although many studies have investigated the genetics of asthma susceptibility, longitudinal studies on genes associated with asthma outcome are scarce. SUMMARY: Despite many high-quality investigations, accurate prediction of adult asthma in childhood is still not feasible. Future studies should focus on associations between genetic background and asthma prognosis as an important area of research with great potential.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate differences in asthma prevalence among Hispanic subgroups and non-Hispanic children living in the United States and to explore the association between these differences and risk factors. METHODS: Weighted logistic regression analyses of merged 1997 to 2001 National Health Interview Survey data were used to estimate the prevalence of asthma diagnosis and asthma attacks in a sample of 46511 children (age: 2-17 years) living in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. RESULTS: Puerto Rican children had the highest prevalence of lifetime asthma (26%) and recent asthma attacks (12%), compared with non-Hispanic black children (16% and 7%, respectively), non-Hispanic white children (13% and 6%, respectively), and Mexican children (10% and 4%, respectively). Adjustment for asthma risk factors did not change these comparisons appreciably. Compared with non-Hispanic white children, the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for a lifetime asthma diagnosis were 2.33 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.90-2.84) for Puerto Rican children, 1.16 (95% CI: 1.04-1.29) for non-Hispanic black children, and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.79-1.03) for Mexican children. Birthplace influenced the association between ethnicity and lifetime asthma diagnosis differently for Puerto Rican and Mexican children. Compared with United States-born non-Hispanic white children with United States-born parents, the adjusted ORs were 1.95 (95% CI: 1.48-2.57) for Puerto Rican children in families with the child and parent(s) born in the 50 states/District of Columbia and 2.50 (95% CI: 1.51-4.13) for island-born Puerto Rican children with island-born parents. The corresponding adjusted ORs for Mexican children were 1.05 (95% CI: 0.90-1.22) for families born in the 50 states/District of Columbia and 0.43 (95% CI: 0.29-0.64) for those born in Mexico. The results were similar for recent asthma attacks. CONCLUSIONS: The appreciably higher asthma morbidity rates experienced by Puerto Rican children cannot be explained by sociodemographic and other risk factors measured in the National Health Interview Survey. The heterogeneity of asthma among Hispanic subgroups should be considered in developing effective public health prevention and intervention strategies.

AB  - The burden of asthma, as measured by asthma prevalence, ambulatory visits, hospitalizations and mortality, has increased dramatically over the last two decades. Asthma continues to be the most common chronic illness of children, associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, despite improved asthma treatment protocols and medications. New interventions are needed to improve asthma morbidity outcomes.The major purpose of this secondary data analysis was to explore the relationship between household routines and the asthma morbidity outcomes of quality of life and burden of asthma for both the child with asthma and his/her parent. This original investigation was supported through the following grants: RO1 NRO4351-03 and RO1 NRO4351-02S1, and led by investigators H. Lorrie Yoos, PhD, Harriet Kitzman, PhD, and Ann McMullen, M.S (2000). Household routines were assessed by each of the study nurses for their own cohort of families, and families were ranked to the degree of routines in the home, from the greatest degree of routines to the least. A parent routine score was also created from questions asked of parents regarding mealtime, bedtime, and medication administration. It was hypothesized that families with more household routines would have a better quality of life than those with fewer household routines, and that families with more routines would have a lower burden of asthma than those who had fewer routines. A secondary aim of this study was to test a proposed model, to determine if adequacy of medication regimen and trigger exposure mediate the relationship between household routines and asthma outcomes.Parents in the most chaotic households, who had the fewest routines, had statistically significant lower quality of life and higher burden of asthma when compared to parents in households with greater routines. Neither parent nor child morbidity outcomes of quality of life and burden of asthma were statistically related to the nurse ranking of degree of routines in the household, though child morbidity outcomes were statistically related to parent report of routine score. Using parent routine score, those families with a greater degree of routines had children with a greater quality of life score, as well as a lower burden of asthma score, though this relationship must be regarded cautiously because of the timing of the data collection. The path analysis supported several of the proposed relationships and suggested several relationships not originally hypothesized. Adequacy of medication regimen and trigger control were not found to mediate the relationship between household routines and asthma outcomes. Nursing interventions are suggested that may improve the asthma morbidity outcomes tested.

AB  - In past decades the prevalence of asthma in children has increased substantially but this trend seems not to have persisted into the twenty-first century. What might have caused the increased prevalence is not well understood. With the expectation that the prevalence may be decreased by reducing exposure to environmental factors, several birth cohort studies are being (or have been) carried out all over the world. Although many studies are still ongoing, decisions on data gathered by these studies will be of great importance for clinical practice. An overview of designs of available studies will be essential in constructing a metaanalysis. We describe the similarities and differences between designs and variable sets of birth cohort studies focusing on the relationship between allergen exposure (solely or in combination with other environmental exposures) and development of childhood asthma. We also evaluate which studies are particularly qualified for inclusion in a meta-analysis relating asthma prevention to environmental exposures. Ongoing birth cohort studies on allergen exposure (solely or in combination with other environmental exposures) in relation to asthma development in children were identified and all available information on study designs was collected and compared. From the 19 studies selected, 13 are prospective cohort studies and 6 are randomized clinical trials (RCTs). All 6 RCTs included children during prenatal life whereas all but 5 prospective cohort studies started after birth. The exposures that almost all studies focus on are house dust mite (HDM) allergens, pet allergens, food allergens, and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). We concluded that RCTs are the best candidates for inclusion in a meta-analysis (an individual subject data analysis) in the future. Four RCTs we evaluated as being particularly suitable for inclusion in a meta-analysis on the basis of similarities in their study designs: the Isle of Wight Study, the Canadian Allergy and Asthma Project (CAAP), the CAPS Study, and the PREVASC Project. Of these four all recommend multifaceted interventions, and differences in their designs are expected to be overcome by stratification and restriction to homogeneous clusters.

AB  - This study was designed to investigate community beliefs about caring for childhood asthma and to elicit suggestions for interventions to improve asthmatic children's health. Focus groups were conducted with parents of children with asthma, children with asthma, school staff, and health care and childcare professionals. Data were analyzed for themes, such as disruption of normal living and having to work in a chaotic system, enabling researchers to posit a core belief for each group. These core beliefs, together with encompassed other, related beliefs held by group members, guide attitudes and actions about asthma. Interventions recommended by focus group participants included creating an asthma play, asthma education, and developing a clinic-based registry to standardize asthma documentation. The community's voice is important in assessment and design of health improvement projects. Incorporating the community's suggestions gives the community a sense of contributing to the health care of their children with asthma.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an asthma education program for children with asthma that is delivered in their school by certified asthma educators from a local hospital-based asthma center. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Twenty-six elementary schools located in a suburb of Toronto. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 256 children in grades 2 to 5 with asthma and their parents were randomized to control and experimental groups. INTERVENTION: Children in the experimental group received the 'Roaring Adventures of Puff' asthma education program over the course of six weekly 1-h sessions. Those in the control group continued receiving usual care. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Data collection involved measuring asthma quality of life, self-efficacy for managing asthma, school absenteeism, days of interrupted activity, health services use, and parental loss of time from work. Quality of life and self-efficacy data were collected from the children at baseline and 2 months. Telephone parental interviews conducted over 1 year were used to collect data on the remaining variables. Unpaired t test, analysis of variance, and chi2 test were used to determine whether differences existed between the groups. The results are reported as the mean +/- SD. The experimental group demonstrated higher scores than the control group for self-efficacy (3.6 +/- 0.7 vs 3.8 +/- 0.9, respectively; p < 0.05) and quality of life (5.0 +/- 1.4 vs 5.5 +/- 1.4, respectively; p < 0.05). At 1 year, the experimental group demonstrated fewer mean urgent health-care visits (2.5 +/- 2.5 vs 1.7 +/- 1.9 visits per year, respectively; p < 0.01), days of missed school (4.3 +/- 5.7 vs 3.0 +/- 4.4 days per year, respectively; p > 0.05), and days of interrupted activity (9.1 +/- 10.5 vs 6.2 +/- 7.3 days per year; p < 0.01) related to asthma than the control group. There were no differences between the groups for parental work absenteeism or scheduled asthma visits. CONCLUSION: Providing an asthma education program to children in their school can significantly improve quality of life and reduce the burden of childhood asthma.

AB  - The National Children's Study will address, among other illnesses, the environmental causes of both incident asthma and exacerbations of asthma in children. Seven of the Centers for Children's Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research (Children's Centers), funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, conducted studies relating to asthma. The design of these studies was diverse and included cohorts, longitudinal studies of older children, and intervention trials involving asthmatic children. In addition to the general lessons provided regarding the conduct of clinical studies in both urban and rural populations, these studies provide important lessons regarding the successful conduct of community research addressing asthma. They demonstrate that it is necessary and feasible to conduct repeated evaluation of environmental exposures in the home to address environmental exposures relevant to asthma. The time and staff required were usually underestimated by the investigators, but through resourceful efforts, the studies were completed with a remarkably high completion rate. The definition of asthma and assessment of disease severity proved to be complex and required a combination of questionnaires, pulmonary function tests, and biologic samples for markers of immune response and disease activity. The definition of asthma was particularly problematic in younger children, who may exhibit typical asthma symptoms sporadically with respiratory infections without developing chronic asthma. Medications confounded the definition of asthma disease activity, and must be repeatedly and systematically estimated. Despite these many challenges, the Children's Centers successfully conducted long-term studies of asthma.

AB  - To better understand what is known about the association between childhood asthma, school attendance, and academic outcomes, the authors reviewed published studies investigating this topic. Tables with brief descriptions of each study's research methodology and outcomes are included. Research reveals evidence that rates of absenteeism are higher among students with asthma. The exact magnitude of absenteeism is difficult to ascertain. However, the studies have helped to identify characteristics of children with asthma that are most likely to be associated with the highest absenteeism rates. Some interventions to improve rates of absenteeism among school-aged children with asthma show promise, but it cannot yet be concluded that students who adhere to medical routines for controlling asthma will as a result increase their rates of attendance. Studies thus far have shown that there is either only a weak or nonexistent association between asthma and school achievement. Further studies are required to verify if certain subpopulations of children with asthma (eg, those with severe and ongoing symptoms, those with disturbed sleep, kindergarten children) are at higher risk for poor school achievement.

AB  - Rationale: Tumor necrosis factor is a proinflammatory cytokine found in increased concentrations in asthmatic airways. The TNF-alpha (TNF) and lymphotoxin-alpha (LTA) genes belong to the TNF gene superfamily located within the human major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6p in a region repeatedly linked to asthma. The TNF position -308 and LTA NcoI polymorphisms are believed to influence TNF transcription and secretion, respectively.Objectives: This study sought to determine whether polymorphisms in TNF or LTA, or in TNF-LTA haplotypes, are associated with asthma and asthma phenotypes.Methods: We genotyped the TNF -308 and LTA NcoI polymorphisms, and two other haplotype-tagging polymorphisms in the TNF and LTA genes, in 708 children with mild to moderate asthma enrolled in the Childhood Asthma Management Program and in their parents. Using an extension of the family-based association tests in the PBAT program, each polymorphism was tested for association with asthma, age at onset of asthma, and time series data on baseline FEV(1) % predicted, postbronchodilator FEV(1) % predicted, body mass index, and log of PC(20).Measurements and Main Results: Although no associations were found for the individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms, the haplotype analysis found the LTA NcoI_G/LTA 4371T/TNF -308G/TNF 1078G haplotype to be associated with asthma and with all five phenotype groups.Conclusions: We conclude that it is unlikely that the TNF -308 or LTA NcoI polymorphisms influence asthma susceptibility individually, but that this haplotype of variants may be functional or may be in linkage disequilibrium with other functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms.

AB  - Rationale: Little is known regarding the relationship between parental history of asthma and subsequent airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in children with asthma.Objectives: We evaluated this relationship in 1,041 children with asthma participating in a randomized trial of antiinflammatory medications (the Childhood Asthma Management Program [CAMP]).Methods: Methacholine challenge testing was performed before treatment randomization and once per year over an average of 4.5 years postrandomization. Cross-sectional and longitudinal repeated measures analyses were performed to model the relationship between PC20 (the methacholine concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV1) with maternal, paternal, and joint parental histories of asthma. Models were adjusted for potential confounders.Measurements and Main Results: At baseline, AHR was strongly associated with a paternal history of asthma. Children with a paternal history of asthma demonstrated significantly greater AHR than those without such history (median log(e)PC20, 0.84 vs. 1.13; p = 0.006). Although maternal history of asthma was not associated with AHR, children with two parents with asthma had greater AHR than those with no parents with asthma (median log(e)PC20, 0.52 vs. 1.17; p = 0.0008). Longitudinal multivariate analysis of the relation between paternal history of asthma and AHR using repeated PC20 measurements over 44 months postrandomization confirmed a significant association between paternal history of asthma and AHR among children in CAMP.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the genetic contribution of the father is associated with AHR, an important determinant of disease severity among children with asthma.

AB  - Objective: To assess the involvement of complements (C3, C4) in the pathophysiology of bronchial asthma.Methods: Selection of patients (n = 64) were made according to the recommended international criteria for diagnosis and classification of asthma. Serum levels of complement components (C3, C4) were measured by radial immunodiffusion technique in 64 Libyan children (age: 1-12 years, sex: 39 males, 25 females) with mild to moderately severe asthma (Group A). Among these patients, 35 had active disease (AA) and 29 had inactive disease (NA). According to age range, 20, 21 and 23 patients were between 1-3 years (A1), > 3-5 years (A2) and > 5-12 years (A3) respectively. A1 had 9 and 11 patients with active (AA1) and inactive (NA1) disease; A2 had 10 and 11 patients with active (AA2) and inactive (NA2) disease; A3 had 16 and 7 patients with active (AA3) and inactive (NA3) disease respectively. Age matched comparisons were made with 57 healthy children (age: 1-12 years; sex: 30 males, 27 females) (Group B). Among the controls, 15, 19 and 23 children were between 1-3 years (B1), > 3-5 years (B2) and > 5-12 years (B3) respectively.Results: Mean C3 level was significantly elevated in patients, while C4 level was normal (A vs B --> C3: P < 0.2, C4: P > 0.2). Serum C3 level was significantly higher in patients with active disease only, while it was normal in patients with inactive disease (AA, NA, B --> P = 0.045); AA vs NA --> P < 0.05, AA vs B --> P < 0.02, NA vs B --> P > 0.05) and C4 levels were normal in both the groups (AA, NA, B --> P = 0.354). Further, C3 levels were significantly elevated in all the age groups, but in patients with active disease only (AA1, NA1, B1 --> P = 0.0024; AA2, NA2, B2 --> P = 0.0411; AA3, NA3, B3 --> P = 0.0102).Conclusion: The elevated C3 level was possibly due to induction by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 (IL-1). The probable mechanisms of C3 involvement in the pathophysiology of bronchial asthma were discussed.

AB  - The issue of whether nursing instruction efforts could improve asthma knowledge and quality of life among schoolchildren was investigated using a quasi-experimental design. The key instruments were the Asthmatic Knowledge Questionnaire and the Childhood Asthma Questionnaire-Form B. Asthmatic knowledge increased among children who received instruction from nurses (Meanpre/post=22.20/31.87, p<.05). These children also experienced significant improvements in their active quality of life (Meanpre/post=27.53/30.20, p<.05), and decreased distress (Meanpre/post=24.04/10.86, p<.05) and asthma severity (Meanpre/post=13.27/8.3, p<.05). This study finds nursing instruction helpful in improving asthma knowledge. However, in terms of quality of life, elevated knowledge has a marked (negative) correlation only with levels of distress and severity. It shows no detectable relationship with active or passive life quality. Therefore, though nursing instruction can improve schoolchildren's knowledge about asthma, the improvement in knowledge only relates to reducing distress and severity and thus improving quality of life. This result can provide guidance for nursing personnel in developing nursing instruction to improve active quality of life in child patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the utility of end-tidal capnography for predicting hospitalization in acute childhood asthma. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective cohort study of a convenience sample of children 5 to 17 years of age presenting to a pediatric emergency department with an acute asthma exacerbation. Capnography was performed at baseline. The length of the plateau portion of the baseline capnograph waveform was measured in millimeters and divided by the respiratory rate at the time of the measurement to create a ratio. The sensitivity and specificity of the baseline capnography ratio for predicting hospitalization were assessed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospitalization versus discharge from the pediatric emergency department. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were enrolled. The hospitalized (n = 12) and discharged (n = 25) groups did not differ in terms of any demographic or baseline characteristics except for pulmonary score and the median baseline capnography ratio. The median ratio was 0.15. Ten (83.3%) of 12 of patients who were hospitalized had a baseline ratio less than 0.15 compared with 8 (32%) of 25 of patients who were discharged from pediatric emergency department (P < 0.05). Controlling for baseline asthma severity, the odds of being hospitalized if the baseline capnography ratio was less than 0.15 were 18.77 (95% confidence interval, 1.91-184.69). CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests that baseline capnography may be useful as an objective effort-independent tool for identifying children with an asthma exacerbation who are at risk for hospitalization.

AB  - In the United States, asthma is the most common cause of school absences due to chronic illness, and its incidence in the pediatric population is increasing. Although most cases of childhood asthma can be controlled with recently available medications, there is often a gap between the goal of optimal control and the actual persistence of symptoms. In this article, Dr Sveum explores one approach to the most advantageous management of childhood asthma-an approach that weighs the advantage of a higher rate of medication adherence in practice against greater medication efficacy in clinical trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In epidemiological studies of the potential health effects of traffic related air pollution, self reported traffic intensity is a commonly used, but rarely validated, exposure variable. METHODS: As part of a study on the impact of Traffic Related Air Pollution on Childhood Asthma (TRAPCA), data from 2633 and 673 infants from the Dutch and the German-Munich cohorts, respectively, were available. Parents subjectively assessed traffic intensity at the home address. Objective exposures were estimated by a combination of spatial air pollution measurements and geographic information system (GIS) based modelling using an identical method for both cohorts. RESULTS: The agreement rates between self reported and GIS modelled exposure--accumulated over the three strata of self assessed traffic intensity--were 55-58% for PM(2.5), filter absorbance (PM(2.5) abs), and nitrogen dioxide in Munich and 39-40% in the Netherlands. Of the self reported low traffic exposed group, 71-73% in Munich and 45-47% in the Netherlands had low modelled exposure to these three air pollutants. Of the self assessed high exposed subgroups in Munich (15% of the total population) and the Netherlands (22% of the total population), only 22-33% and 30-32% respectively had high modelled exposure to the three air pollutants. The subjective assessments tend to overestimate the modelled estimates for PM(2.5) and NO2 in both study areas. When analysis was restricted to the portion of the Dutch cohort living in non-urban areas, the agreement rates were even lower. CONCLUSIONS: Self reported and modelled assessment of exposure to air pollutants are only weakly associated.

AB  - Health care providers, including nurses, physicians, and other personnel, are key figures who design and implement plans of care to help families manage childhood asthma, yet families' perceptions of relationships with these professionals has received limited study. Child and parent perspectives about relationships with their health care providers emerged as themes in a study that explored responsibility sharing between school-age children with asthma and their parents (Buford, 2004). Fourteen school-age children with asthma and 14 of their parents from 11 families participated in the study. Parents and, to a lesser extent, children, described aspects of their relationships with their health care providers that were supports or barriers to asthma management. Implications for nurses and other health care providers stem from these data and include the importance for health care providers to educate themselves and their patients about state-of-the-art asthma care. Education should be directed to both parents and their children. In addition, parents need to receive education about how to coach their children because the children depend on them for information and direction. Finally, nurses and other health care providers need to listen to parents and value their input about their children's conditions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the association between forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and cognitive ability in midlife in the normal population. METHODS: Multiple regression was used to test associations between FEV1 and cognitive function in 1778 men and women in the MRC National Survey of Health and Development, also known as the British 1946 birth cohort. Analyses were adjusted for sex, body size (birth weight, adult height, weight, and chest circumference), socioeconomic status, lifetime smoking, and a range of health indicators, including early respiratory vulnerability (infant lower respiratory infection, childhood asthma, and exposure to atmospheric pollution). RESULTS: FEV1 at 43 years was associated with slower psychomotor speed (peg placement) at the same age and with slower decline in psychomotor speed (letter search speed) from 43 to 53 years, independently of the previously mentioned potential confounders. These independent associations were not observed, however, for adult verbal ability, verbal memory, or rate of decline in memory, which were significantly explained by socioeconomic status and adolescent cognitive ability. In a subsequent analysis, adolescent cognition was positively associated with FEV1, although not with rate of decline in FEV1 from 43 to 53 years, again independently of the previously mentioned confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive function and FEV1 are positively associated across the life course. One possible explanation lies in the parallel action of endocrine, autonomic, and motor control systems on respiration and higher mental function. Because respiration and mental function are both associated with functional capacity and survival, this is a matter of potential clinical significance.

AB  - Asthma is the most prevalent chronic illness among children. Although inhaled corticosteroids are the recommended controller drug for treatment and prevention of childhood asthma attacks, long-term adherence is low. Our study aimed to determine the prevalence of fears and concerns of parents of children with asthma toward corticosteroid treatment, and the relationship of these concerns with level of adherence with therapy. Fifty mothers of asthmatic children aged 1-13 years, attending the Primary Care Pediatric Center in Beer- Sheva, were included in the study. Long-term inhaled corticosteroids were recommended to all the children. Four mothers refused to participate. Forty-six mothers were interviewed using a structured questionnaire regarding the presence of fears and concerns toward the use of inhaled corticosteroids. They were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of fears and concerns toward the treatment. Data regarding asthma history, socioeconomic status, level of adherence to treatment, sources of information regarding asthma treatment, and the use of alternative medicine were also collected. Fourteen (30.4%) mothers reported fears and concerns related to chronic treatment of their children with inhaled corticosteroids (concerned mothers). Thirty-two mothers (69.6%) expressed no fears regarding this treatment (confident mothers). Both groups were similar in their socioeconomic status. Five of 14 (35.7%) concerned mothers compared with only one of 32 (3.1%) confident mothers reduced the recommended dosage (p = 0.004). More concerned mothers tend to receive information from lay literature, friends, and relatives and to use alternative homeopathic treatment compared with confident mothers. Among concerned mothers, the reasons mentioned for their concerns were risk of addiction (64%), weight gain or stunting (50%), toxicity (35%), and irritability or hyperactivity (57%). Maternal fears and concerns about the potential side effects of prolonged inhaled corticosteroid treatment on their asthmatic children are fairly common and tend to decrease their adherence to treatment.

AB  - Some ecological analyses suggest an influence of neighborhood environment on asthma outcomes. However, no previous study has applied a multilevel approach to assess an ecological effect of neighborhood environment on the incidence of childhood asthma accounting for individual risk factors. This study assessed the influence of neighborhood and individual-level factors on the incidence of childhood asthma among all children born in Rochester, Minnesota, between 1976 and 1979. We identified asthmatics among all children born in Rochester, between 1976 and 1983. We applied a multilevel survival model with the frailty term to assess the effects of neighborhood characteristics, such as mean family income per census tract (n = 16) from the 1980 census report and the status of whether a census tract faces intersections with major highways or railroads, on asthma incidence. The relative risks (RR) of neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES), the status of whether census tracts face intersections with highways or railroads and the variance of random effect of census tracts were calculated adjusting individual-level covariates for asthma, including gender, birth weight, mother's age at birth and parental educational level at birth. We found that the RR of developing asthma among children living in census tracts facing intersections with highways or railroads was 1.6 (95% CI: 1.1-2.2) compared to those who lived in census tracts not facing intersections, adjusting individual- and neighborhood-level covariates. The variance of the frailty term attributable to census tracts was small (0.0085) and was modified (from 0.004 to 0.0085, 112% change) by adding neighborhood covariates. The overall effects of individual-level factors on asthma incidence were independent of neighborhood environment. The influence of neighborhood environment on childhood asthma in a non-inner-city setting, like Rochester, Minnesota, was small to modest. Incorporating pertinent neighborhood-level covariates into multilevel models needs to be considered in assessing the random effect of clusters.

AB  - The prevalence of childhood asthma has risen significantly over the past four decades. A family history of atopic disease is associated with an increased likelihood of developing asthma, and environmental triggers such as tobacco smoke significantly increase the severity of daily asthma symptoms and the frequency of acute exacerbations. The goal of asthma therapy is to control symptoms, optimize lung function, and minimize days lost from school. Acute care of an asthma exacerbation involves the use of inhaled beta2 agonists delivered by a metered-dose inhaler with a spacer, or a nebulizer, supplemented by anticholinergics in more severe exacerbations. The use of systemic and inhaled corticosteroids early in an asthma attack may decrease the rate of hospitalization. Chronic care focuses on controlling asthma by treating the underlying airway inflammation. Inhaled corticosteroids are the agent of choice in preventive care, but leukotriene inhibitors and nedocromil also can be used as prophylactic therapy. Long-acting beta2 agonists may be added to one of the anti-inflammatory medications to improve control of asthma symptoms. Education programs for caregivers and self-management training for children with asthma improve outcomes. Although the control of allergens has not been demonstrated to work as monotherapy, immunotherapy as an adjunct to standard medical therapy can improve asthma control. Sublingual immunotherapy is a newer, more convenient option than injectable immunotherapy, but it requires further study. Omalizumab, a newer medication for prevention and control of moderate to severe asthma, is an expensive option.

AB  - Swyer-James (MacLeod) syndrome is an acquired form of unilateral hyperlucency of the lung and is characterized by the development of severe emphysema, bronchiectasis, and/or bronchiolitis obliterans. It may develop as a complication of repeated episodes of pulmonary infection resulting in bronchiolitis obliterans and obstruction of small airways. Most patients with Swyer-James (MacLeod) syndrome can be managed clinically, and the pathologic features of the syndrome have been described in only a few reports. Placental transmogrification of the lung is a rare histopathologic finding that has been described in patients with severe emphysema associated with cigarette smoking, congenital bullous emphysema, and librochondromatous hamartomas of the lung and is characterized by the development of peculiar structures in the pulmonary parenchyma that resemble placental villi. To our knowledge, placental transmogrification of the lung has not been previously described in patients with Swyer-James (MacLeod) syndrome. We encountered a 32-year-old man with a history of childhood asthma who presented with progressively severe exertional dyspnea and had unilateral right lung hyperlucency. The patient underwent a right pneumonectomy. Examination of the lung revealed severe mixed centriacinar-panacinar emphysema in all lobes, bullous emphysema in the upper lobe, bronchiectases, mild interstitial pneumonia with fibrosis, and placental transmogrification of the pulmonary parenchyma of all 3 lobes. Here, we review the pathology of Swyer-James (MacLeod) syndrome and the possible pathogenesis of villous-like changes in the lung tissues.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Racial and ethnic disparities exist in reported childhood asthma prevalence, but it is unclear if disparities stem from true prevalence differences or a different likelihood of receiving a diagnosis from a health professional. Concern has been raised that asthma may be underdiagnosed, particularly among minority children who have more restricted access to high-quality health care. OBJECTIVE: To examine racial/ethnic differences among currently symptomatic children in acquiring an asthma diagnosis to determine if relative underdiagnosis among minorities exists. Children for whom no symptoms were reported (a group that includes those with well-controlled symptoms) were excluded from the analysis. METHODS: The 1999 National Health Interview Survey includes a nationally representative sample of children with reported wheezing symptoms. We included children 3 to 17 years old in the study and analyzed racial/ethnic differences in asthma diagnosis, controlling for young age, gender, parental education, single-parent household, central-city residence, region of residence, health insurance, having a usual place of care, and parent-reported severity of wheezing symptoms. RESULTS: Among those reported to have wheezed in the past year (n = 946), 83% of Puerto Rican, 71% of non-Hispanic black, and 65% of Mexican children were diagnosed with asthma compared with 57% of non-Hispanic white children. Using non-Hispanic white children as the reference group, the approximate adjusted relative risk for physician diagnosis of asthma given wheezing in the past year was 1.43 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04, 1.63) for Puerto Rican, 1.22 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.37) for non-Hispanic black, and 1.19 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.39) for Mexican children. Minority children were reported to have greater severity of wheezing symptoms. Even after accounting for this increased severity, children in racial and ethnic minority groups were as or more likely to have a reported asthma diagnosis than non-Hispanic white children. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not provide evidence for the hypothesis that symptomatic minority children are underdiagnosed with asthma compared with non-Hispanic white children. To the contrary, among currently symptomatic children, minority children were more likely to be diagnosed than non-Hispanic white children even after accounting for the higher wheezing severity among minority children.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations of maternal and grandmaternal smoking before, during, and after pregnancy with childhood asthma. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a case-control study nested within the Children's Health Study in southern California. The case patients consisted of 338 children with asthma that had been diagnosed in the first 5 years of life, and 570 control subjects were countermatched on in utero exposure to maternal smoking within grade, sex, and community of residence. MEASUREMENTS: Detailed maternal and household smoking histories and other asthma risk factor information was obtained by telephone interview. RESULTS: The participation rates were 72.3% and 82.5%, respectively, for control subjects and case patients. In utero exposure to maternal smoking was associated with increased risk for asthma diagnosed in the first 5 years of life (odds ratio [OR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0 to 2.3), and for persistent asthma (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.3). The associations did not differ in children with early transient asthma compared to those with early persistent asthma. Relative to never-smokers, children whose mothers smoked throughout the pregnancy had an elevated risk of asthma in the first 5 years of life (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.6). Children of mothers who quit smoking prior to the pregnancy showed no increased risk (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.5 to 1.5). We were unable to assess the association of smoking cessation during pregnancy because very few mothers were reported to have done so (15%). Asthma risk did not increase in a monotonic pattern with smoking intensity during pregnancy. Postnatal secondhand smoke exposure was not independently associated with asthma. Grandmaternal smoking during the mother's fetal period was associated with increased asthma risk in her grandchildren (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.4 to 3.2). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal and grandmaternal smoking during pregnancy may increase the risk of childhood asthma.

AB  - The adverse effects of vaccines are easily ignored by the medical profession because they're limited to a few that are already documented (DPT encephalopathy, MMR autism, etc.) and occur within a few days after they are given. They are also difficult to recognize even when looked for because they represent only a more severe version of whatever disease elements are already present in each child; i.e., a non-specific effect of the vaccination process per se, for which any vaccine will suffice. Illustrative cases connect vaccines to the common diseases of childhood (asthma, eczema, otitis, allergies, sinusitis, ADD, autism, etc.). This leads to a simple hypothesis to explain how vaccines act. The remainder of the article applies these ideas to vaccines of more recent vintage, and concludes with recommendations for vaccine and health policy.

AB  - RATIONALE: Several studies have identified an association between asthma and obesity in women. It remains unclear if this association is due to genuine asthma or to symptoms caused by overweight, at what age the association develops, and whether it is confined to females. OBJECTIVE: To explore the relations between body mass index, asthma, and atopy in a birth cohort of approximately 1,000 individuals. METHODS: Information on asthma and measurements of lung function, airway responsiveness, and atopy were obtained on multiple occasions between ages 9 and 26. Associations between these outcomes and body mass index were analyzed using generalized mixed linear regression models. Further analyses adjusted for potential covariates including breastfeeding, birth order, parental asthma, and personal and family smoking history. MAIN RESULTS: Body mass index was positively associated with asthma, wheeze, asthma treatment, atopy, immunoglobulin E, and inversely with the FEV(1)/FVC ratio in females. There was no significant association with airway responsiveness to methacholine or salbutamol. There was little evidence of an association between body mass index and asthma or atopy in males. Analyses adjusting for potential covariates showed similar findings. Asthma was not associated with a raised body mass index in childhood and childhood asthma did not lead to being overweight as an adult. CONCLUSIONS: A raised body mass index is associated with asthma and atopy in women but not men. Population attributable fraction calculations estimate that 28% (95% confidence interval 7-45) of asthma developing in women after age 9 is due to overweight.

AB  - AIM: To determine the burden of asthma in children. METHODS: A cross sectional, randomised, computer assisted telephone survey of a community based sample of 2020 children aged 5-14 years in western Sydney (New South Wales) over a 20 day period from June 2000 to July 2000. RESULTS: Main outcome measures were carer reported history of asthma diagnosis, hospital presentation/admission for asthma, recent use of anti-asthma medications, and recent respiratory symptoms. Diagnosed asthma was reported in 31% (of whom 42% were diagnosed aged 2 years or under) and asthma medications used in the previous year by 21% of children. Factors significantly associated with a reported asthma diagnosis included: male gender (OR: 1.51), birth in Australia (OR: 1.64), living in an English speaking household (OR: 1.47), Aboriginality (OR: 2.32), possession of a health care card (OR: 1.28), previous pneumonia (OR: 2.4) or pertussis (OR: 2.0), and a recent episode of croup (OR: 1.9). Exposure to tobacco smoke and immunisation status were not significant. DISCUSSION: We confirm a high prevalence of asthma and medication use for asthma. The high proportion of children diagnosed asthmatic at 2 years or under (when asthma cannot be diagnosed reliably) suggests overdiagnosis of asthma may contribute to the apparent high prevale.

AB  - Although progress has been made in understanding the pathophysiology of asthma and identifying key features of quality asthma care, the prevalence of childhood asthma remains high. Barriers to effective asthma care that currently exist include the persistence of environmental risk factors, disparities in care that stem from poverty and cultural differences, and inconsistencies in the quality of asthma care provided by clinicians. Pediatric nurse practitioners at Yale New Haven Children's Hospital have actively implemented the recommended guidelines for asthma care and addressed causes for some of the disparities in asthma health care. Two major initiatives are described: the Asthma Care Coordination Project at Yale New Haven Hospital Pediatric Primary Care Center, and the establishment of an Asthma Outreach Program. Recommended resources and Web sites for the practitioner are also provided.

AB  - The importance of monitoring the food and nutrient consumption of Australia's population and key subgroups has been highlighted as one of the four priority objectives of Australia's National Food and Nutrition Policy (1) and is a priority action area in Eat Well Australia (2).The 1995 National Nutrition Survey (3) provided, for the first time, reliable estimates of mean food and nutrient intakes for the population as a whole and for major population subgroups of the Australian population. With appropriate adjustments, the 1995 survey results could also be compared with the 1983 and 1985 National Dietary Surveys of adults and of children, to give the first indication we have of recent trends in food and nutrient consumption (4,5).From 1998 to 2001 the work of the Australian Food and Nutrition Monitoring Unit (AFNMU) contributed to filling data gaps, refining new measurement methods and creating a framework for an ongoing system for food and nutrition monitoring. One of AFNMU's final recommendations called for the 'key next steps' of another national nutrition survey, together with interim use of standardised short survey questions to measure selected food habits (6). However, to date there has been little progress in obtaining funding for another national survey, or in coordinating the states to collect similar interim dietary information, or in creating a systematic method of collecting and disseminating food and nutrition related data.Until a system for routine food and nutrition monitoring is in place, selected studies such as that reported by Webb et al. in this issue (7) can help to fill some gaps in information about special groups, as well as supply valuable methodological information useful in designing shortcut dietary assessment methods.In the article, Meat consumption among 18-month-old children participating in the Childhood Asthma Prevention Study, Webb et al. raise a number of considerations which are important in obtaining useful information from population dietary studies.

AB  - Objective: To document meat consumption among 18-month-old children, for use in refining population dietary assessment methods and dietary guidance for young children.Design: A secondary analysis of data collected in 1998-2000 from the 18 months follow up of the Childhood Asthma Prevention Study: an intervention trial of omega-3 oil supplementation and house-dust mite reduction, from birth to five years.Subjects and setting: Pregnant women whose unborn children had an atopic family history were recruited from antenatal clinics of six hospitals in western Sydney. Carers of 429 18-month-old children (80% response) satisfactorily completed three-day weighed food records.Main outcome measures: Mean and median intakes per day and portion sizes of various meats and meat products.Statistical analyses: T-tests for comparing gender differences; Pearson correlation and one-way analysis of variance for relationships between meat and nutrient intake.Results: During the recording period 94% of the children ate meat. McDonald's Chicken McNuggets TM , beef mince, and beef sausages were the most frequently consumed meats. Median portion sizes ranged from 20-50 g, and were considerably smaller than 'usual' portions specified on food frequency questionnaires in common use. Higher meat diets in this age group were not associated with higher intakes of iron or zinc per MJ.Conclusion: The marginally low intakes of iron and zinc in this age group could be improved by greater use of cuts of red meat appropriately prepared for toddlers.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether pranlukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, attenuates exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) in children with asthma. The study was designed as a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled two-period crossover trial. The subjects were 17 stable asthmatic children aged 7-14 years old (mean, 11.0 years) with a history of typical symptoms of EIB. They received dry syrup of pranlukast or placebo both after supper on the first day and after breakfast on the second day of the study in each period. All exercise challenges were performed on a bicycle ergometer and spirometry measurements of pulmonary function (FVC, FEV1.0, PEF, MMF, V[50] and V[25] were collected pre-and post-exercise. Compared with placebo, pranlukast significantly inhibited the reduction of pulmonary function after exercise. Consequently, this study demonstrated that pranlukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, is a useful drug in childhood asthma management.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Past studies of the prevalence of childhood asthma have yielded conflicting findings as to whether racial/ethnic disparities remain after other factors, such as income, are taken into account. The objective of this study was to examine the association of race/ethnicity and family income with the prevalence of childhood asthma and to assess whether racial/ethnic disparities vary by income strata. METHODS: Cross-sectional data on 14,244 children aged <18 years old in the 1997 National Health Interview Survey were examined. The authors used logistic regression to analyze the independent and joint effects of race/ethnicity and income-to-federal poverty level (FPL) ratio, adjusting for demographic covariates. The main outcome measure was parental report of the child having ever been diagnosed with asthma. RESULTS: Bivariate analyses, based on weighted percentages, revealed that asthma was more prevalent among non-Hispanic black children (13.6%) than among non-Hispanic white children (11.2%; p<0.01), but the prevalence of asthma did not differ significantly between Hispanic children (10.1%) and non-Hispanic white children (11.2%; p=0.13). Overall, non-Hispanic black children were at higher risk for asthma than non-Hispanic white children (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03, 1.40), after adjustment for sociodemographic variables, including the ratio of annual family income to the FPL. Asthma prevalence did not differ between Hispanic children and non-Hispanic white children in adjusted analyses (adjusted OR=0.85; 95% CI 0.71, 1.02). Analyses stratified by income revealed that only among children from families with incomes less than half the FPL did non-Hispanic black children have a higher risk of asthma than non-Hispanic white children (adjusted OR=1.99; 95% CI 1.09, 3.64). No black vs. white differences existed at other income levels. Subsequent analyses of these very poor children that took into account additional potentially explanatory variables did not attenuate the higher asthma risk for very poor non-Hispanic black children relative to very poor non-Hispanic white children. CONCLUSIONS: Non-Hispanic black children were at substantially higher risk of asthma than non-Hispanic white children only among the very poor. The concentration of racial/ethnic differences only among the very poor suggests that patterns of social and environmental exposures must overshadow any hypothetical genetic risk.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We determined the prevalence of asthma and estimated baseline asthma symptoms and asthma management strategies among children aged 0-12 years in Central Harlem. METHODS: The Harlem Children's Zone Asthma Initiative is a longitudinal, community-based intervention designed for poor children with asthma. Children aged 0-12 years who live or go to school in the Harlem Children's Zone Project or who participate in any Harlem Children's Zone, Inc, program were screened for asthma. Children with asthma or asthma-like symptoms were invited to participate in an intensive intervention. RESULTS: Of the 1982 children currently screened, 28.5% have been told by a doctor or nurse that they have asthma, and 30.3% have asthma or asthma-like symptoms. To date, 229 children are enrolled in the Harlem Children's Zone Asthma Initiative; at baseline, 24.0% had missed school in the last 14 days because of asthma. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of asthma among children in the Harlem Children's Zone Project is consistent with reports from other poor urban communities. Intensive efforts are under way to reduce children's asthma symptoms and improve their asthma management strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cesarean delivery modifies infant gut bacterial flora composition, which may result in hindered tolerance to allergenic substances, thereby increasing the risk of asthma in accordance with the hygiene hypothesis. Results of previous studies regarding an association between birth route and asthma are conflicting, and these studies have not evaluated some potential confounding effects, including prematurity and maternal asthma. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cesarean delivery in full-term and premature infants increases the risk of subsequent childhood asthma hospitalization. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study using the Washington State Birth Events Record Database linked to statewide hospitalization data. The study included 2,028 children hospitalized for asthma (cases) and 8,292 age-matched controls. RESULTS: Cesarean delivery was modestly associated with an increased risk of asthma hospitalization (odds ratio [OR], 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.39). However, when analyzed separately, there was an association between cesarean delivery and asthma hospitalization in premature infants (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.09-3.02) but not in full-term infants (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.97-1.34). CONCLUSIONS: Cesarean delivery was associated with subsequent asthma hospitalization only in premature infants. Because mothers with asthma are reported to have increased rates of cesarean delivery and premature delivery, other factors in addition to the hygiene hypothesis, including genetic and in utero influences associated with maternal asthma, may contribute to the increased risk of asthma in premature infants.

AB  - In recent years childhood asthma has increased. Although the precipitants of childhood asthma are yet to be established possible contributing factors are local ambient air pollutants. This study aims to assess associations of regional ambient air pollutants on emergency department childhood asthma presentations across four regions of the city of Melbourne, Australia. Daily emergency department (ED) presentations for asthma in children were studied for the years 2000 and 2001. Estimates of local air pollutant levels were obtained using simulation modelling techniques. Generalized Additive Models were used to examine associations between combined local levels of air pollutants and childhood asthma ED presentations adjusting for seasonal variation, day of week effects, and meteorological variables. There was consistent associations between childhood ED asthma presentations and regional concentration of PM[10], with a strongest association of RR=1.17 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.31) in the central district of Melbourne. NO[2] and Ozone was associated with increased childhood asthma ED presentations in the Western districts. This study suggests that regional concentrations of PM10 may have a significant effect on childhood asthma morbidity. In addition, ozone may play a role however, its effect may vary by geographical region.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood asthma has risen dramatically not only in the western societies and now forms a major and still increasing public health problem. The aims of this study were to follow up at the age of ten the patterns of asthma symptoms and associations among children with a clinically diagnosed asthma in a sizeable urban-rural community and to in compare them with demographic controls using a standardised questionnaire. METHODS: In a defined region in Sweden with a population of about 150,000 inhabitants, all children (n = 2,104) born in 1990 were recorded. At the age of seven all primary care and hospital records of the 1,752 children still living in the community were examined, and a group of children (n = 191) was defined with a well-documented and medically confirmed asthma diagnosis. At the age of ten, 86% of these cases (n = 158) and controls (n = 171) completed an ISAAC questionnaire concerning asthma history, symptoms and related conditions. RESULTS: Different types of asthma symptoms were highly and significantly over-represented in the cases. Reported asthma heredity was significantly higher among the cases. No significant difference in reported allergic rhinitis or eczema as a child was found between cases and controls. No significant difference concerning social factors or environmental exposure was found between case and controls. Among the control group 4.7% of the parents reported that their child actually had asthma. These are likely to be new asthma cases between the age of seven and ten and give an estimated asthma prevalence rate at the age of ten of 15.1% in the studied cohort. CONCLUSION: A combination of medical verified asthma diagnosis through medical records and the use of self-reported symptom through the ISAAC questionnaire seem to be valid and reliable measures to follow-up childhood asthma in the local community. The asthma prevalence at the age of ten in the studied birth cohort is considerably higher than previous reports for Sweden. Both the high prevalence figure and allowing the three-year lag phase for further settling of events in the community point at the complementary roles of both hospital and primary care in the comprehensive coverage and control of childhood asthma in the community.

AB  - Objective: To examine the role of higher long-term poverty rates in the Maritimes as an explanation for higher rates of asthma among children 2-7 years of age.Methods: Using longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY), logistic regressions examine associations between poverty duration and the probability of a child having been diagnosed with asthma, having a current asthma attack or experiencing wheezing in the past 12 months, controlling for other known determinants.Results: NLSCY data indicate that 15.9% of Maritime children have been diagnosed with asthma, 8.7% have recently had an attack and 24.1% experienced wheezing, statistically higher levels than in the rest of Canada. Children in chronic poverty show rates that are over 30% higher than the Canadian averages. Although 19.9% of Maritime children have been chronically poor compared to 11.7% elsewhere, and although poverty is associated with a higher probability of asthma/wheezing, controlling for poverty status does not eliminate the regional difference in asthma rates. Including other controls with poverty status again does not fully explain the difference.Conclusion: While these findings do not completely explain why asthma prevalence rates are higher for Maritime children, they do indicate important pathways from poverty to childhood asthma. For example, chronically poor children are more likely to have had low birthweights and are less likely to have been breastfed, both of which are correlates of asthma. Such information can be useful for policy-makers. Pollutants and other environmental factors associated with asthma not included in the study may help further explain regional differences.

AB  - Psychosocial and emotional factors are important in childhood asthma. Nevertheless, drug therapy alone continues to be the main treatment. Treatment programmes that include behavioural or psychological interventions have been developed to improve disturbed family relations in the families of children with severe asthma. These approaches have been extended to examine the efficacy of family therapy to treat childhood asthma in a wider group of patients. This review systematically examines these studies. Recognition that asthma can be associated with emotional disturbances has led to the investigation of the role of family therapy in reducing the symptoms and impact of asthma in children. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of family therapy as an adjunct to medication for the treatment of asthma in children. We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register, Psychlit and Psychinfo. Searches are current as of January 2005. Randomised trials comparing children undergoing systematic therapy focusing on the family in conjunction with asthma medication, with children taking asthma medication only. Two reviewers assessed the studies for inclusion in the review. Two trials with a total of 55 children were included. It was not possible to combine the findings of these two studies because of differences in outcome measures used. In one study, gas volume, peak expiratory flow rate and daytime wheeze showed improvement in family therapy patients compared to controls. In the other study, there was an improvement in overall clinical assessment and number of functionally impaired days in the patients receiving family therapy. There was no difference in forced expiratory volume or medication use in both studies. There is some indication that family therapy may be a useful adjunct to medication for children with asthma. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures.[CINAHL Note: The Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews contain interactive software that allows various calculations in the MetaView.]

AB  - No single professional can care adequately for a young child with asthma: Parents and professionals must collaborate.By using the transdisciplinary Chronic Care Model, parents and professionals can help children control their asthma.* Two major barriers to reducing childhood asthma are: (a) failure to implement guidelines for diagnosis and management, and (b) lack of adequate, afford-able housing.* Childhood asthma can be reduced only through ongoing patient education, partnerships among agencies, and continued advocacy for improved housing.

AB  - The development of childhood asthma and/or atopy has been associated with the persistence of T-helper type 2 (Th2) cytokine responses. Diminished interleukin-10 (IL-10) production from dendritic cells (DCs) may influence Th2 skewing. The purpose of this study was to characterize the ontogeny of DC IL-10 and Th2 responses during infancy. Blood was obtained from 40 healthy infants at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 5 months of age, and from 20 healthy children aged 6-12 years. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMNCs) were purified and stimulated, and supernatants were assayed for IL-13 and IFN-gamma. DCs were cultured and stimulated, and supernatants were assayed for IL-10. Median DC IL-10 (pg/mL) and Th2 cytokine production (IL-13:IFN-gamma) were 1.5 and 2.6 at 2 weeks, 1.5 and 2.9 at 3 months, 1.5 and 3.0 at 5 months, and 11.0 and 0.9 during childhood, respectively (p < 0.01). The frequency of subjects with detectable IL-10 levels was 28% at 2 weeks, 18% at 3 months, 19% at 5 months and 85% during childhood (p < 0.001). These results demonstrate that DC IL-10 production is diminished and Th2 skewing is enhanced during infancy. Future studies need to expand upon the sample size and determine whether diminished DC IL-10 production during infancy predisposes to the development of asthma and/or atopy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthma prevalence rates are high, and may be increasing in the Western world, particularly among children. The aim of this study was to evaluate the longer-term social and economic consequences of having asthma as a child and to determine whether adverse consequences are more severe for poorer children. METHODS: Results from published and unpublished, quantitative and qualitative studies were synthesized narratively to examine the impact of childhood-onset asthma on school attendance, academic achievement and employment in adulthood. The question of whether the impact differed for different social groups was also examined. FINDINGS: Twenty-nine good quality studies were identified, including in total 12 183 children with asthma or wheeze. Compared with asymptomatic children, those with asthma missed more days of school (additional absence as a result of asthma ranged from 2.1 to 14.8 days). Studies of academic achievement found that children with asthma performed as well as their healthy peers. The existing evidence on labour market performance is sparse, but there is an indication that people with asthma during childhood experience disadvantage in later employment. In an examination of consequences by social position, children with asthma from deprived areas were more likely to miss school than their more affluent peers, and minority ethnic children were also more likely to have poor school attendance. The only qualitative study suggested that children with asthma strove to participate fully in every aspect of their daily lives. INTERPRETATION: Although asthma limits children's daily activities and affects their social activities, this research synthesis found little evidence of major, adverse long-term social and economic consequences in studies reviewed. Further longitudinal research using comparison groups is needed to fill key gaps in the existing evidence base.

AB  - Attendance for general practitioner (GP) care of childhood asthma varies widely in New Zealand (NZ). There is little current research to account for the variations, although groups such as Maori and Pacific peoples have traditionally faced barriers to accessing GP care. This paper aims to describe and account for attendance levels for GP asthma care among 6-9 year-olds with moderate to severe asthma in Auckland, NZ. During 2002, randomly selected schools identified all 6-9 year-olds with possible breathing problems. Completion of a questionnaire by each parent/guardian indicated which children had moderate to severe asthma, and what characteristics influenced their access to GP asthma care. A multilevel, negative binomial regression model (NBRM) was fitted to account for the number of reported GP visits for asthma, with adjustment for clustering within schools. Twenty-six schools (89.7 percent) identified 931 children with possible breathing problems. Useable questionnaires were returned to schools by 455 children (48.9 percent). Results indicated 209 children with moderate to severe asthma, almost one in every three reportedly making 5 or more GP visits for asthma in the previous year. Maori, Pacific and Asian children were disproportionately represented among these 'high attendees'. Low attendees (0-2 visits) were mainly NZ Europeans. The NBRM (n=155) showed that expected visits were increased by perceived need, ill-health, asthma severity and, in particular, Maori and Pacific child ethnicity. It may be that Maori and Pacific children no longer face significant barriers to accessing GP asthma care. However, more likely is that barriers apply only to accessing routine, preventative care, leading to poor asthma control, exacerbations requiring acute care, and paradoxically an increase in GP visits. That barriers may increase total numbers of visits challenges the assumption, for all health systems, that access can be defined in terms of barriers that must be overcome to obtain health care.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine factors that influence the natural history of asthma, such as genetics, atopy, air pollution and environmental tobacco smoke, gastroesophageal reflux, and infection, to promote early identification and treatment of patients at risk for persistent asthma. DATA SOURCES: Journal articles published in English involving human subjects with asthma. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were selected for their relevance to the discussion of asthma and the factors that contribute to its persistence. Epidemiologic studies were favored in assessing the natural history of asthma from childhood to adulthood. RESULTS: Major factors that can influence the severity and persistence of asthma are genetics, atopy, pollution, environmental tobacco smoke, gastroesophageal reflux, and respiratory infections. Epidemiologic studies reveal that factors strongly linked to the persistence of childhood asthma into adult life are early age of disease onset with more severe symptoms, atopy, and level of allergen exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is still much research to be done, epidemiologic studies have repeatedly proven that the natural history of asthma is in some ways predictable. Early identification of patients at risk for persistent asthma, combined with early institution of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic intervention strategies, may lead to better outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether neonatal respiratory morbidity at term is associated with an increased risk of later asthma and whether this may explain previously described associations between caesarean delivery and asthma. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using Scottish Morbidity Record (SMR) data of maternity (SMR02), neonatal (SMR11), and acute hospital (SMR01) discharges. SETTING: Scotland. PARTICIPANTS: All singleton births at term between 1992-1995 in 23 Scottish maternity hospitals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital admission with a diagnosis of asthma in the principal position between 1992 and 2000. RESULTS: Children who had a diagnosis of transient tachypnoea of the newborn or respiratory distress syndrome were at increased risk of being admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of asthma (hazard ratio (HR) 1.7, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.4 to 2.2, p<0.001). This association was observed both among children delivered vaginally (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.0, p = 0.007) and among those delivered by caesarean section (HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.6 to 3.0, p<0.001). In the absence of neonatal respiratory morbidity, delivery by caesarean section was weakly associated with the risk of asthma in childhood (HR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.2, p = 0.004). The strengths of the associations were similar whether the caesarean delivery was planned or emergency and were not significantly altered by adjustment for maternal, obstetric, and other neonatal characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal respiratory morbidity at term is associated with an increased risk of asthma in childhood which may explain previously described associations between caesarean delivery and later asthma.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine whether respiratory therapists (RTs) had an elevated risk of respiratory symptoms and to determine the association of work exposures with symptoms. METHODS: Mailed questionnaire responses from 275 RTs working in British Columbia, Canada, were compared to those of 628 physiotherapists who had been surveyed previously. Analyses incorporated logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age, sex, smoking status, and childhood asthma. RESULTS: Compared to physiotherapists, RTs had over twice the risk of being woken by dyspnea, having wheeze, asthma attacks, and asthma diagnosed after entering the profession. Among RTs, two work factors associated with asthma were sterilizing instruments with glutaraldehyde-based solutions and the use of aerosolized ribavirin. RTs who used an oxygen tent or hood had the highest risk of asthma diagnosed after entering the profession (odds ratio [OR], 8.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 12.6 to 26.0) and of asthma attacks in the last 12 months (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.2 to 10.9). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that RTs may be at an increased risk for asthma-like symptoms and for receiving a diagnosis of asthma since starting to work in their profession, possibly related to exposure to glutaraldehyde and aerosolized ribavirin.

AB  - We asked whether the addition of PEF recordings to a symptom-based self-management plan improved outcome in school children with asthma. In an open-randomized, parallel-group, controlled trial, we studied children aged 7-14 years with moderate asthma. After a 4-week run-in, 90 children were randomized to receive either PEF plus symptom-based management or symptom-based management alone for 12 weeks. Thresholds for action based on PEF were 70% of best (for increasing inhaled steroids) and 50% of best (for commencing prednisolone). Children were asked to perform twice-daily spirometry at home (using an electronic recording spirometer that revealed only PEF to the study group alone) and to record a symptom diary. The mean daily symptom score was the main outcome. There were no differences between groups in mean symptom score or in spirometric lung function, PEF, quality of life score, or reported use of health services over 12 weeks. During acute episodes, children responded to changes in symptoms by increasing their inhaled steroids at a mean value of PEF of greater than 70% of best so that overall PEF did not contribute to this important self-management decision. Knowledge of PEF did not enhance self-management even during acute exacerbations.

AB  - Current guidelines for asthma care categorize asthma severity based on the frequency of asthma symptoms, medication use, and lung function measures. The objective of this study was to determine whether lung function measures are consistent with levels of asthma severity as defined by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program/Expert Panel Report 2 Guidelines. Parents of children aged 5-18 years with asthma seen in two outpatient subspecialty clinics completed questionnaires regarding asthma medication use and symptom frequency over the preceding 1 and 4 weeks, respectively. All children performed spirometry. When asthma severity was based on the higher severity of asthma symptom frequency or medication use, asthma was mild intermittent in 6.9% of participants, mild persistent in 27.9%, moderate persistent in 22.4%, and severe persistent in 42.9%. FEV(1) % predicted did not differ by level of asthma severity. FEV(1)/FVC decreased as asthma severity increased (p < 0.0001) and was abnormal in 33% of the participants, and a greater percentage of participants had an abnormal FEV(1)/FVC as asthma severity increased (p = 0.0001). In children, asthma severity classified by symptom frequency and medication usage does not correlate with FEV(1) categories defined by National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Guidelines. FEV(1) is generally normal, even in severe persistent childhood asthma, whereas FEV(1)/FVC declines as asthma severity increases.

AB  - From the Childhood Asthma Management Program cohort, which was randomly assigned to receive budesonide, nedocromil, or placebo for 4-6 years, we determined the prevalence of and factors associated with at least 1% per year loss in postbronchodilator FEV(1)% predicted. Participants who had a significant reduction in postbronchodilator FEV(1)% predicted (SRP), comprised 25.7% of the cohort (n = 990). Using logistic regression, predictors of SRP at baseline were younger age (p = 0.0005), male sex (p < 0.0001), clinic (p = 0.02), and higher postbronchodilator FEV(1)% predicted (p = 0.02). Examination of the SRPs indicated that the effect of baseline lung function was such that the higher the lung function, the less steep the reduction in postbronchodilator FEV(1)% predicted (p < 0.0001). A similar proportion of SRPs was found in each treatment group. Among the SRPs, the rate of reduction in postbronchodilator FEV(1)% predicted was similar in all treatment groups. At a single site where biomarker assessment was performed, SRPs also had more prominent eosinophilic inflammation during the washout period. The course and mechanisms of lung function reduction or slow lung growth velocity in children with asthma must be defined.

AB  - The field of environmental health promotion gained new prominence in recent years as awareness of physical environmental stressors and exposures increased in communities across the country and the world. Although many theories and conceptual models are used routinely to guide health promotion and health education interventions, they are rarely applied to environmental health issues. This article examine show health promotion theories and models can be applied in designing interventions to reduce exposure to environmental health hazards. Using the Community Action Against Asthma (CAAA) project as an example, this article describes the application of these theories and models to an intervention aimed at reducing environmental triggers for childhood asthma. Drawing on the multiple theories and models described, a composite ecological stress process model is presented, and its implications for environmental health promotion discussed.

AB  - QVAR [hydrofluoroalkane-134a beclometasone dipropionate (BDP)] produces equivalent asthma control to chlorofluorocarbon-based BDP inhalers, at approximately half the daily dose in adults, a probable consequence of the increased lung deposition of QVAR that results from its greater fine particle fraction. Recent studies have relied on the clinical experience with QVAR in adults as a basis for investigations in childhood asthma. Design considerations, such as the use of the breath-actuated Autohaler delivery device and measurement of direct health benefits, account for problems of variation in inspiratory flow, handling difficulties and low airways resistance that are associated with children. QVAR appears to be well tolerated in children with no clinically relevant adverse effects on adrenal function, bone metabolism or growth at recommended doses.

AB  - Asthma is a complex disease that involves physiological, environmental, and psychosocial factors. This paper reviews childhood asthma case management by social service professionals, lay health workers, and nurses, and it presents a new randomized controlled study using nurse case management in a local community coalition. Evidence suggests the common factor for success involves case managers spending time contacting and patiently and persistently working with the family, thus building a trusting relationship. Although case management time is an expense for a health care payer, provider, and the child and family, the positive outcomes achieved can demonstrate the benefit of these interventions to all parties involved. The described experimental study assesses the cost and effectiveness of home-based nurse case management by a community coalition for children visiting an emergency department for asthma care.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous research documents an association of poor parental mental health with asthma in children. This study aims to determine whether the associations between parental mental health problems and childhood asthma attacks persist after controlling for childhood anxiety and depression and other confounding factors. DESIGN/METHODS: A community household sample of youth ages 4 to 17 years and their primary caregivers from the US Commonwealth of Puerto Rico was studied to determine the associations between parental mental health and childhood asthma attacks. Regression models that predicted asthma attacks in youth controlled for parental mental health problems, childhood anxiety and depression, zone of residence, and parents' age, education, and perception of poverty. RESULTS: After adjusting for children's depressive and anxiety disorders as well as other important confounders, associations between parental depression, suicide attempts, ataque de nervios, and history of mental health treatment and asthma attacks in offspring, by parental report, persisted. Additionally, the frequency of parental mental health problems was associated with children's asthma attacks. CONCLUSION: Parents with mental health problems were more likely to report histories of asthma attacks in their children compared with parents without mental health problems in Puerto Rico. These associations were not attributable to internalizing disorders in youth but persisted independent of childhood psychopathology and other confounding factors. Clinicians and researchers should recognize the relations between poor parental mental health and childhood asthma and explore the potential role of family psychosocial and behavioral factors related to the manifestation of the disease.

AB  - Little is known about rates and predictors of remission of childhood asthma after the onset of puberty. We used data collected at ages 6, 8, 11, 13, and 16 years from the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study, a population-based birth cohort. The onset of puberty was defined as the age of appearance of the first pubertal signs as reported by parents. Information on wheezing both before and after onset of puberty (mean +/- SD follow-up from onset of puberty, 4.2 +/- 1 year) was available for 781 children. Of these, 166 had asthma (either frequent wheezing or a physician-confirmed diagnosis plus any wheezing) in at least one survey before puberty. In this group, 58% of the children (97 of 166) reported the presence of wheezing after the onset of puberty (unremitting asthma). In contrast, only 30% (39 of 131) of the children with infrequent wheezing before puberty experienced wheezing episodes after the onset of puberty (unremitting wheezing). In addition to frequent wheezing before puberty, obesity, early onset of puberty, active sinusitis, and skin test sensitization were significant and independent predictors of unremitting asthma after the onset of puberty. Our findings from a population-based longitudinal cohort challenge the commonly held view that asthma usually remits during adolescence.

AB  - In recent years, an increasing number of observations has lent support to the concept that dysregulation of apoptosis may play a role in the development of airway inflammation in asthma. In the present study, serum sFas and soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), during and 2 weeks after the treatment of the acute attack in 15 asthmatic children (range, 2-14 years; median, 5 years) to evaluate the possible role of the Fas-FasL system in asthmatic inflammation. Serum sFas levels of stable asthmatic patients were significantly higher than both the ones with acute attack and the controls (p < 0.001, p < 0.01, respectively). sFas levels were higher in nonatopic asthmatics, both in the acute and stable phases, than those of the atopics. sFasL levels during the acute attack were significantly higher than those of the controls (p < 0.05). sFasL levels of patients receiving inhaler corticosteroid (ICS) treatment were significantly higher than those of the patients who did not receive ICS treatment during the acute attack (p < 0.05). The significant increase of sFas levels in asthmatic children during the stable phase of the disease rather than the acute phase made us consider that antiapoptotic mechanisms such as sFas may have a great role in ongoing persistent chronic inflammation. The increased levels of sFasL in patients with acute asthma may be the reflection of the effort of immune system for limitation of inflammation by increasing apoptosis of inflammatory cells.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the relative importance of perinatal, social, and environmental factors in a birth cohort for the risk of developing asthma in a 10-year followup. A group of children (n = 144) with medically diagnosed asthma was matched to a control group of demographic twins (n = 144) from the same birth cohort and region. In a defined region in Sweden, children with a well-documented and medically confirmed asthma diagnosis were retrospectively identified and followed from birth up to the age of 10. Asthma diagnosis, perinatal and obstetric factors, and social data for both the case and control groups were collected through medical records at all health centers in primary care, privately practicing pediatricians, and the public pediatric clinic in the region. The parents of these children answered the standardized ISAAC postal questionnaire, with an overall response rate of 87%. Family history of asthma and allergic rhinitis and low birth weight indicated an increased asthma risk. The social class of the mother and life-style factors concerning mothers smoking habits and indication of passive smoking were also related to increased asthma risk. Also residential factors like mist or mold damage, unusual odors, and dry air were found to indicate increased asthma risk. Maternal asthma, low birth weight, and exposure to passive smoking in the family were all found to be independent predictors for childhood asthma.

AB  - In 2002 the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program published evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma, but there are some unresolved asthma-management issues that need further research. For asthmatic children inhaled corticosteroids are more beneficial than as-needed use of beta(2) agonists, long-acting beta(2) agonists, theophylline, cromolyn sodium, nedocromil, or any combination of those. Leukotriene modifiers are an alternative but not a preferred treatment; they should be considered if the medication needs to be administered orally rather than via inhalation. Cromolyn sodium and nedocromil are effective long-term asthma-control medications, but they are not as effective as inhaled corticosteroids. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether cromolyn benefits maintenance of childhood asthma. Cromolyn sodium and nedocromil are alternatives, but not preferred treatments for mild persistent asthma. Cromolyn may be useful as a preventive therapy prior to exertion or unavoidable exposure to allergens. Regular inhalation of corticosteroids controls asthma significantly better than as-needed beta(2) agonists. No studies have examined the long-term impact of regular inhaled corticosteroids on lung function in children <or= 5 years old. As monotherapy, inhaled corticosteroids are more effective than long-acting beta(2) agonists. The asthma-control benefit of inhaled corticosteroids decidedly outweighs the risks from inhaled corticosteroids. There is no high-level evidence that low-to-medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids have ocular toxicity or important effects on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function in children. Antibiotic therapy has no role in asthma management unless there is a bacterial comorbidity, but further research is needed on the relationship between sinusitis and asthma exacerbation. The asthma care plan should include a written asthma action plan for the patient, but there is inadequate evidence as to whether the asthma action plan should be based on symptoms or on peak flow monitoring. There is low-level evidence that helium-oxygen mixture (heliox) may be of benefit in the first hour of an acute asthma attack but less advantageous after that first hour. Metered-dose inhalers are no more or less effective, overall, than other aerosol-delivery devices for the delivery of beta(2) agonists or inhaled corticosteroids, so the least expensive delivery method should be chosen.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety of long-term (36 months) administration of an inhaled corticosteroid (budesonide) on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function in children with mild to moderate asthma. METHODS: This was an ancillary study of the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP). Sixty-three children who had mild to moderate asthma and were enrolled in CAMP underwent evaluation of HPA axis function before and 12 and 36 months after receiving continuous therapy with either an inhaled anti-inflammatory agent (budesonide 400 microg/day or nedocromil 16 mg/day) or placebo. HPA axis function was assessed by serum cortisol levels 30 and 60 minutes after 0.25 mg of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and 24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion. RESULTS: There were no differences in serum cortisol levels after ACTH stimulation between treatment groups, regardless of time after ACTH administration or months of follow-up. Urinary cortisol excretion per body surface area was similar in both treatment groups at 36 months, after adjusting for age at randomization, race, gender, and clinic. Cumulative inhaled corticosteroid exposure did not influence serum cortisol response to ACTH or urinary free cortisol excretion at 36 months. CONCLUSIONS: We found no effects of chronic budesonide treatment at a dose of 400 micro g/day on HPA axis function in children with mild to moderate asthma and demonstrated the absence of a cumulative effect on HPA axis function over a 3-year period.

AB  - Children's exposure to tobacco constituents during fetal development and via environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure is perhaps the most ubiquitous and hazardous of children's environmental exposures. A large literature links both prenatal maternal smoking and children's ETS exposure to decreased lung growth and increased rates of respiratory tract infections, otitis media, and childhood asthma, with the severity of these problems increasing with increased exposure. Sudden infant death syndrome, behavioral problems, neurocognitive decrements, and increased rates of adolescent smoking also are associated with such exposures. Studies of each of these problems suggest independent effects of both pre- and postnatal exposure for each, with the respiratory risk associated with parental smoking seeming to be greatest during fetal development and the first several years of life.

AB  - Recent public recognition that children are different from adults in their exposures and susceptibilities to environmental contaminants has its roots in work that began >46 years ago, when the American Academy of Pediatrics (APA) established a standing committee to focus on children's radiation exposures. We summarize the history of that important committee, now the AAP Committee on Environmental Health, including its statements and the 1999 publication of the AAP Handbook of Pediatric Environmental Health, and describe the recent emergence of federal and state legislative and executive actions to evaluate explicitly environmental health risks to children. As a result in large part of these efforts, numerous knowledge gaps about children's health and the environment are currently being addressed. Government efforts began in the 1970s to reduce childhood lead poisoning and to monitor birth defects and cancer. In the 1990s, federal efforts accelerated with the Food Quality Protection Act, an executive order on children's environmental health, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry/Environmental Protection Agency Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units, and National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences/Environmental Protection Agency Centers of Excellence in Research in Children's Environmental Health. In this decade, the Children's Environmental Health Act authorized the National Children's Study, which has the potential to address a number of critical questions about children's exposure and health. The federal government has expanded efforts in control and prevention of childhood asthma and in tracking of asthma, birth defects, and other diseases that are linked to the environment. Efforts continue on familiar problems such as the eradication of lead poisoning, but new issues, such as prevention of childhood exposure to carcinogens and neurotoxins other than lead, and emerging issues, such as endocrine disruptors and pediatric drug evaluations, are in the forefront. More recently, these issues have been taken up by states and in the international arena.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diminished interleukin 10 (IL-10) production has been documented in children and adults with asthma and atopy. Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is recognized as a risk factor for the development of childhood asthma. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is an association between ETS and dendric cell (DC) IL-10 production during infancy. METHODS: ETS was evaluated by questionnaire, and blood samples were obtained at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 5 months of age in 37 healthy infants. DCs were cultured and stimulated, and supernatants were assayed for IL-10 by enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: Sixteen infants had no history of exposure to ETS, and 21 infants had a history of ETS exposure. The frequency of subjects with detectable IL-10 levels was similar in both groups at 2 weeks and 3 months but significantly different at 5 months (P < .001). In those without ETS exposure, the frequency with detectable IL-10 levels increased during the observation period (25% at 2 weeks, 20% at 3 months, and 36% at 5 months; P = .03 vs 2 weeks). In contrast, in those with ETS exposure, the frequency with detectable IL-10 levels decreased during the observation period (33% at 2 weeks, 19% at 3 months; P = .02 vs 2 weeks; and 7% at 5 months; P < .001 vs 2 weeks). CONCLUSIONS: Our study results demonstrate an association between ETS and diminished DC IL-10 production during infancy. Future studies need to expand on these sample sizes and explore whether diminished DC IL-10 production is the mechanism by which ETS predisposes patients to the development of asthma and/or atopy.

AB  - The aim of this article is to estimate the effect of dietary avoidance of standard cows milk protein on the development of asthma and/or wheeze in infants with a family history of atopy using a systematic review of all available randomized controlled trials. Eleven trials were included in the review. The results show that risk of infants experiencing asthma or wheeze during the first year of life was reduced when using hydrolysed milk formula instead of standard cow's milk formula. Use of soya-based formula did not reduce the risk of having asthma or wheeze. This article concludes that breastfeeding should be the treatment of choice for all babies. However, where supplemental feeding is required, hydrolysed formula (in combination with dietary restrictions and reduction in environmental allergen exposure) significantly reduces the risk of developing asthma or wheeze in the first year of life in infants with a family history of atopy. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that soya-based milk formula modifies the risk of developing asthma or wheeze.

AB  - Study Objectives: To determine respective contributions of alveolar and proximal airway compartments in exhaled nitric oxide (NO) output (QNO) in pediatric patients with asthma and to correlate their variations with mild symptoms or bronchial obstruction.Patients and Design: In 15 asthmatic children with recent mild symptoms, 30 asymptomatic asthmatic children, and 15 healthy children, exhaled NO concentration was measured at multiple expiratory flow (V) rates allowing the calculation of alveolar and proximal airway contributions in QNO, using two approaches, ie, linear and nonlinear models.Measurements and Results: Asymptomatic and recently symptomatic patients were not significantly different regarding FEV(1) and maximum V between 25% and 75% of FVC (MEF(25-75)): FEV(1), 93.3 +/- 13.4% vs 90 +/- 7.5%; MEF(25-75), 70 +/- 22% vs 68 +/- 28% of predicted values, respectively (mean +/- SD). Maximal airway QNO output was significantly higher in recently symptomatic vs asymptomatic patients (p < 0.0001), and in asymptomatic patients vs healthy children (p < 0.02): 134 +/- 7 nl/min, 55 +/- 43 nl/min, and 19 +/- 8 nl/min, respectively. In a multiple regression analysis, variables that influenced airway QNO output were symptoms (p < 0.0001) and distal airway obstruction as assessed by MEF(25-75) (p < 0.05). Alveolar NO concentration (FANO) was significantly (p < 0.03) higher in recently symptomatic than in patients without symptoms, whereas it was not significantly different between asymptomatic patients and healthy children: 7.2 +/- 2.4 parts per billion (ppb), 5.5 +/- 2.7 ppb, and 4.2 +/- 2.0 ppb, respectively.Conclusions: An increase in FANO was observed in the presence of symptoms, and proximal airway NO output was correlated with distal obstruction during asthma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthma is the most common chronic childhood disease. Childhood asthma contributes significantly to morbidity among children and has a significant impact on the quality of life (QoL) and daily routines of both the children and their parents. AIM AND OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate how Swedish parents of children with asthma experience their QoL, and to investigate whether there were differences concerning QoL between parents within the same family. The purpose was also to investigate possible connections between their QoL and background variables. METHOD: A total of 371 parents of children with asthma (57% mothers and 43% fathers) participated in the study. The Paediatric Asthma Caregiver's Quality Of Life Questionnaire (PACQLQ) was used to measure the parents' QoL, i.e. how the child's asthma interferes with the parents' normal activities and how it has made them feel. RESULTS: The findings show that most parents of children with asthma evaluated their QoL as close to the positive end of the scale, and there was close agreement in the scoring between parents within the same family. Significant associations were found between parents' lower QoL outcome and living in the North of Sweden. There were also significant associations between fathers' lower QoL outcome and having a child younger than 13 years of age and mothers' lower QoL outcome and having a child with severe asthma. Although the result shows that a child's asthma did not influence the parents' QoL to a greater degree, it is still important for healthcare workers to help these parents to sustain and improve their well-being. CONCLUSIONS: The fact that they just evaluated their QoL during the preceding week only, and did so at the time when their children were being treated with asthma medication, might have influenced the results in a positive direction.

AB  - Today, about 5 million children in the United States - one in every 15 children under the age of 18 - have asthma. The social and economic costs of childhood asthma are high. Asthma management requires a multifaceted approach, including partnerships among physicians, school nurses, and parents to create a continuum of care that is often missing from conventional health-care delivery systems. At a local level, coalitions are an important strategy for promoting partnerships for the management of asthma. Focus groups were conducted in the Hampton Roads region of southeastern Virginia to provide in-depth information about barriers to the management of asthma. The perspectives of physicians, school nurses, and parents who live in areas characterized as having unusually high rates of emergency department visits or hospitalizations for asthma were included. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the qualitative data obtained from these focus groups.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the role of environmental and hereditary factors in determining whether persistent childhood wheezing phenotypes had an early or late onset. METHODS: In a whole population birth cohort (n = 1456), children were seen at birth and at 1, 2, 4, and 10 years. At each visit, information was collected prospectively regarding wheeze prevalence and used to classify subjects into wheezing phenotypes. Information on genetic and environmental risk factors in early life was also obtained prospectively, and skin-prick testing to common allergens was performed at 4 years. RESULTS: Early-onset persistent wheezers (n = 125) had wheeze onset in the first 4 years, still present at age 10, whereas late-onset persistent wheezers (n = 81) had wheeze onset after age 4 years that was still present at 10 years. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified independent significance only for inherited factors (parental asthma, family history of rhinitis, eczema at 4 years, and atopic status at 4 years) in the development of late-onset persistent wheeze. However, low social class at birth, recurrent chest infections at 2 years, and parental smoking at 2 years plus inherited factors (eczema at 2 years; food allergy at 4 years; maternal asthma, sibling asthma, maternal urticaria, and atopic status at 4 years) demonstrated independent significance for early-onset persistent wheeze. CONCLUSION: Inheritance seems to be of prime significance in the cause of persistent childhood wheeze. Environmental exposure in early life may combine with this tendency to produce an early onset of persistent wheeze. Absence of these environmental factors might delay but not prevent the onset of wheeze in children with atopic heredity.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We examined the relationships among maternal smoking in pregnancy, fetal development, and the risk of asthma in childhood. METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study, where all 58 841 singleton births were followed for 7 years using nationwide registries. RESULTS: Maternal smoking increased the risk of asthma (adjusted odds ratio = 1.35; 95% confidence interval = 1.13, 1.62 for high exposure). Low birthweight and preterm delivery increased the risk of asthma at the age of 7, whereas being small for gestational age did not. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal smoking in pregnancy increases the risk of asthma during the first 7 years of life, and only a small fraction of the effect seems to be mediated through fetal growth.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthma prevalence is known to vary among different geographical regions both nationally and internationally. However, there is limited understanding of the nature of differences within geographical regions. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of asthma in 2 prairie communities and differences in the patterns of respiratory symptoms between the communities. METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was sent through schools in Estevan and Swift Current, Saskatchewan, to parents of 2,231 children in grades 1 to 6. Asthma prevalence was determined by questionnaire report of physician-diagnosed asthma. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) using spirometry were conducted in children in grades 1 to 4. To evaluate respiratory morbidity without the use of a diagnostic label, similar comparisons were made between communities for respiratory symptoms. RESULTS: The overall response rate to the survey questionnaire was 91.3%. The prevalence of ever asthma in Estevan was 21.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20.1%-22.7%) compared with 16.2% (95% CI, 15.1%-17.3%) in Swift Current. A higher proportion of girls in Estevan (19.7%; 95% CI, 17.9%-21.5%) compared with girls in Swift Current (12.5%; 95% CI, 11.1%-13.9%) reported a history of asthma. There was no difference found between towns for boys. These findings were supported by findings for respiratory symptoms, including wheeze and cough. For both boys and girls, the forced expiratory flow at 25% to 75% of forced vital capacity and the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity were lower in Estevan compared with Swift Current. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the distribution of childhood asthma can be found within regions. These results are strengthened by PFTs and cannot be fully explained by diagnostic biases.

AB  - Low-income, minority, and uninsured children use the emergency department (ED) more often for asthma care, and suffer increased mortality and morbidity compared to their less vulnerable peers. This comparative correlational study used the Behavioral Model of Health Services Utilization to examine predisposing, enabling and need-related characteristics of families who use the ED for care of childhood asthma, and determinants of follow-up care.A convenience sample of 63 children presenting to the ED for asthma care were enrolled. Data were collected from parents, ED providers, and medical records. The dependent variable was follow-up care within 30 days of the ED visit. Specific hypotheses were as follows: (1) Families who obtain follow-up care will differ in predisposing, enabling, and need characteristics from families who do not obtain follow-up care; (2) Families who fail to obtain follow-up care will differ in predisposing, enabling, and need characteristics from families who obtain follow-up care; and (3) Families who use the ED for childhood asthma will exhibit common predisposing, enabling, and need characteristics.Two-thirds of the subjects did not follow up as directed. Logistic regression was used to test the study hypotheses. Mother's level of education was significantly associated with no follow-up (p = 0.0282). At the 10% level of significance, the combined effects of travel time to usual source of care, wait time, smoker in the home, fur-bearing pet in the home, parent-evaluated severity, provider-evaluated severity, and provider-evaluated severity for the previous year predicted no follow-up. Odds Ratio (OR) of no follow-up were higher for children with more severe asthma (OR 12.44) or older mothers (OR 2.14).Subject enrollment was insufficient to achieve statistical power and may have influenced these findings. Additional study limitations included nonrandom sample selection, use of a correlational design, and self-report measures.This study has direct implications for nursing practice, education, and research. Follow-up of children with asthma is not occurring at the desired levels; therefore additional steps to remove barriers to follow-up should be taken. A larger study exploring ED follow-up determinants should be conducted, as well as a study of nursing interventions to improve follow-up.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Asthma is a phenotypically heterogeneous disorder and, over the years, many different clinical subtypes of asthma have been described. A precise definition of asthma phenotypes is now becoming more and more important, not only for a better understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms, but in particular to ascertain the specific genes associated with these phenotypes. RECENT FINDINGS: In children, three asthma phenotypes are now well defined: transient infant wheezing, nonatopic wheezing of the toddler, and IgE-mediated wheezing/asthma. Recently, a fourth phenotype, late-onset childhood asthma has been added to this list. In adults, asthma persisting from childhood into adulthood should be distinguished from asthma starting in adulthood. The phenotypes of adult-onset asthma are still poorly defined. Until now, phenotypic classification has been based primarily on etiologic factors (eg, aspirin sensitivity, persistent respiratory infections, occupational factors, or toxic exposures) or clinical characteristics of the disease (eg, mild, severe, brittle, near fatal, with fixed airflow obstruction, steroid resistant). Novel noninvasive techniques to assess the type and severity of airway inflammation and dysfunction are increasingly used to identify better the different phenotypes. SUMMARY: The classic phenotype of IgE-mediated asthma starting in childhood is now clearly defined. However, many other phenotypes of asthma in childhood as well in adulthood are being recognized. In particular, asthma starting in adulthood and noneosinophilic asthma constitute an important part of the adult asthma population, and are still poorly defined. A precise definition of these asthma phenotypes is urgently needed because they are likely to be associated with different genotypes, responses to treatment, and prognoses.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: The Vesta project aims to assess the role of traffic related air pollution in the occurrence of childhood asthma. DESIGN AND SETTING: Case-control study conducted in five French metropolitan areas between 1998 and 2000. A set of 217 pairs of matched 4 to 14 years old cases and controls were investigated. An index of lifelong exposure to traffic exhausts was constructed, using retrospective information on traffic density close to all home and school addresses since birth; this index was also calculated for the 0-3 years age period to investigate the effect of early exposures. MAIN RESULTS: Adjusted on environmental tobacco smoke, personal and parental allergy, and several confounders, lifelong exposure was not associated with asthma. In contrast, associations before age of 3 were significant: odds ratios for tertiles 2 and 3 of the exposure index, relative to tertile 1, exhibited a positive trend (1.48 (95%CI = 0.7 to 3.0) and 2.28 (1.1 to 4.6)), with greater odds ratios among subjects with positive skin prick tests. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that traffic related pollutants might have contributed to the asthma epidemic that has taken place during the past decades among children.

AB  - Social science theories of health and place posit that individuals perceive a relationship between characteristics of the geographic location in which they reside and their health, well-being, and self-identity. A number of ethnographies of health and place have studied how urban and suburban populations impacted by industrial pollution or waste have come to perceive a link between rates of cancer and their unhealthy environment. There has been little study of the applicability of the health and place framework to community perceptions of long-term chronic illness. This paper examines the asthma perceptions of Yup'ik parents of asthmatic children using data from semi-structured ethnographic interviews conducted in five villages and one town of the Yukon-Kuskokwim delta of southwest Alaska. Informants cited local climatic features, large-scale changes of the last 30 years to the village built landscape, and ongoing conditions of substandard housing and sanitation as etiological factors associated with childhood asthma. Our study suggests the need for further research concerning lay perceptions of one aspect of the epidemilogic transition-the association between chronic illness and place, especially in rural communities undergoing dramatic developmental change.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Parental atopy and environmental exposures are recognized risk factors for childhood asthma. However, the relative contributions of specific risk factors and the overall contributions of indoor and outdoor exposures remain unexplored. This study was undertaken to identify risk factors, estimate the population attributable risk of each exposure, and compare the data for boys versus girls for physician-diagnosed asthma in Taiwanese schoolchildren. METHODS: During a February to June 2001 cross-sectional national survey, 35 036 6- to 15-year-old schoolchildren were chosen from 22 elementary and 22 middle schools located within 1-km catchment areas of 22 air-monitoring stations in Taiwan. The main outcome measure was physician-diagnosed asthma, as reported by the parents. We investigated hereditary and indoor and outdoor environmental factors for childhood asthma by questionnaire. The adjusted prevalences of questionnaire-determined outdoor indicators were also compared with air-monitoring data. RESULTS: Outdoor air pollutants were associated with parent-reported perceived ambient air pollution. Physician-diagnosed asthma was reported for 8.1% of the boys (1330 of 16 441) and 5.6% of the girls (894 of 16 056). The risk of physician-diagnosed asthma was significantly associated with parental atopy and perceived ambient air pollution in both sexes. The presence of visible cockroaches (odds ratio [OR]: 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-1.59), mold on walls at home (OR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.01-1.41), and water damage (OR: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.02-1.70) were also associated with asthma in girls; however, only visible mold on walls at home was related to asthma in boys. Mutually adjusted analytical models produced statistically significant associations between any indoor factor and asthma in girls (OR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.00-1.56) but not in boys (OR: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.87-1.25). For all hereditary and environmental factors, the total population attributable risk was 44.31% in boys and 60.61% in girls. CONCLUSIONS: Parental atopy contributed more to childhood asthma than indoor or outdoor environmental factors. Girls may be more susceptible to indoor factors than boys.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous epidemiologic studies have revealed that bronchial asthma affects populations without regard to frontiers. However, standardized methodological approaches are necessary to compare these populations. OBJECTIVE: To investigate objective markers of childhood asthma on an epidemiologic basis and to include Turkish children in international comparisons. METHODS: Parental questionnaires were collected and skin prick tests performed on fourth grade primary schoolchildren, aged 8 to 11 years, residing in Ankara, Turkey. Pulmonary function tests and bronchial challenge with hypertonic saline (HS) were conducted in children selected from this cohort with a stratified random sampling according to the presence of current wheezing. RESULTS: A total of 3,041 questionnaires were included in the evaluation. Skin prick tests were performed on 2,774 children (97.1%). A total of 347 children from this cohort underwent pulmonary function and bronchial challenge tests. In 18 (5.1%) of the 347 children, bronchial challenge tests could not be successfully completed. The prevalence values were 11.5% for current wheezing, 6.9% for physician-diagnosed asthma, and 7.7% for physician-diagnosed recurrent bronchitis. Population-based weighted prevalence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) was 21.8%. Frequency of responses to HS was 38.6% among physician-diagnosed asthma cases and 30.5% among patients with current wheezing. Skin test positivity was present in 38.7% of the children with a diagnosis of asthma or asthmatic bronchitis, 35.0% of current asthmatic patients, and 19.2% of patients with current wheezing. CONCLUSIONS: Objective markers, in addition to the questionnaire-based prevalence figures, need to be used in epidemiologic surveys for asthma, especially in countries with inadequate health care facilities or problems with interpretation of the wheeze concept.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous research has demonstrated links between low socioeconomic status (SES) and clinical asthma outcomes, as well as links between stress and asthma. The objective of this study was to test whether adolescents with asthma from different SES backgrounds differed in biological profiles relevant to asthma, including immune and cortisol measures. The second objective was to test whether psychological stress and control beliefs could explain these differences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adolescents with persistent asthma from either low (N= 18) or high (N= 12) SES neighborhoods were interviewed about their stress experiences (chronic stress, acute life events, interpretations of ambiguous life events) and control beliefs. Blood was drawn to assess immune (cytokines, eosinophils, IgE) and neuroendocrine (cortisol) markers associated with asthma. RESULTS: Adolescents in the low SES group had significantly higher levels of a stimulated cytokine associated with a Th-2 immune response (IL-5), higher levels of a stimulated cytokine associated with a Th-1 immune response (IFN-gamma), and marginally lower morning cortisol values compared with the high SES group. Low SES adolescents also had greater stress experiences and lower beliefs about control over their health. Statistical mediational analyses revealed that stress and control beliefs partially explained the relationship between SES and IL-5/IFN-gamma. CONCLUSION: Our finding that low SES was associated with elevations in certain immune responses (IL-5/IFN-gamma) in adolescents with asthma suggests the importance of further exploration into relationships between SES and Th-2/Th-1 responses in asthma. Our findings also suggest that psychological stress and control beliefs may provide one explanation for links between SES and immune responses in childhood asthma.

AB  - Airway pathology has been extensively investigated in adulthood asthma, whereas only few studies examined bronchial biopsies in childhood asthma. To evaluate the airway pathology in children with asthma, we analyzed bronchial biopsies obtained from 23 children undergoing bronchoscopy for clinical indications other than asthma. Nine had mild/moderate asthma. Six had atopy without asthma, and eight had no atopy or asthma. We measured basement membrane thickness and quantified the number of eosinophils, mast cells, neutrophils, macrophages, T lymphocytes, and positive cells for transforming growth factor-ß1 (TGF-ß1) and its receptors I and II (TGFß-RI and TGFß-RII) in subepithelium. Children with asthma had an increase in basement membrane thickness and in the number of eosinophils compared with control subjects, but not compared with children with atopy. They also had a decreased expression of TGFß-RII compared with both those with atopy and control subjects. In children with asthma, the number of eosinophils correlated negatively with TGFß-RII and positively with symptom duration. In conclusion, airway eosinophilia and basement membrane thickening, which are the pathologic features that are characteristic of adulthood asthma, are already present in children with mild asthma, and even in children with atopy without asthma. Moreover, in children with asthma but not in children with atopy without asthma, there is a downregulation of TGFß-RII.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Exposure to air pollutants has been investigated as a possible cause of asthma attacks in children. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the short-term effects of air pollutants on a panel of 133 children with asthma who enrolled in the Childhood Asthma Management Program. METHODS: During screening, the children completed daily diary cards for an average of 58 days to indicate their medication use and asthma severity. We used ordinal logistic regression to compare the odds of a more serious relative to a less serious asthma attack, and we used a Poisson model to analyze medication use. In both analyses we accommodate dependence in the data and different periods of observation for study subjects. RESULTS: Our results indicate that a 10-microg/m3 increase in particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 microm (PM2.5) lagged 1 day was associated with a 1.20 times increased odds of having a more serious asthma attack [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.05 to 1.37] and a 1.08-fold increase in medication use (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.15). A 10-microg/m3 increase in particulate matter less than or equal to 10 microm (PM10) increased the odds of a more serious asthma attack (odds ratio = 1.12; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.22) and also increased medication use (relative risk = 1.05; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.09). CONCLUSIONS: Increases in PM2.5 and PM10 are significantly associated with an increased risk of more severe asthma attacks and medication use in Seattle area children with asthma. We also found associations with carbon monoxide, but we believe that carbon monoxide is a marker for exposure to combustion byproducts.

AB  - It is postulated that health effects of air pollution may be direct and indirect through people's perception about the severity of pollution and concerns over its impact on their health. A cross sectional postal survey of some 6,559 households was conducted in the area of Ellesmere Port and Neston Borough Council. A total of 3,402 (51.9%) usable questionnaires were returned and included in the subsequent analyses. Childhood asthma was associated with central heating. Adult asthma was associated with the number of people in the house who had ever smoked and 'crowding'. General adult respiratory symptoms were associated with perception of industrial air pollution and neighbour noise in univariable but not multivariable analyses. In the multivariable model number of people in the household who had ever smoked, exposure to traffic fume pollution, crowding and living in rented accommodation. This suggests a complex relationship between actual levels of pollution (though not directly measured in this study), social deprivation, socio-behavioural factors and people's perceptions about pollution. A model of the relationship of these factors is proposed and it is argued that studies of the health impact of air pollution that concentrate only on chemical exposure will be flawed unless they are placed in the context of perception and socio-behavioural factors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of 2 nebulizable controller asthma medications on caregiver and pediatric quality of life. METHODS: In this 52-week, randomized trial, children aged 2 to 6 years with mild to moderate persistent asthma received budesonide inhalation suspension 0.5 mg (total daily dose) once or twice daily (n = 168) or cromolyn sodium nebulizer solution 20 mg 4 times daily (n = 167) for 8 weeks, with dosage adjustment thereafter at the investigators' discretion. The Pediatric Asthma Caregiver's Quality of Life Questionnaire (PACQLQ), Compliance/Caregiver Satisfaction Questionnaire (CCSQ), Modified Child Health Questionnaire-Parent Form 50 (CHQ-PF50), and Functional Status-II(R) (FS-II[R]) Questionnaire were administered at baseline and weeks 8, 28, and 52. Global assessments of ease of asthma management and child health status were obtained from caregivers and physicians at the end of the study. RESULTS: Improvements from baseline in domain-specific (activities and emotional function) and total PACQLQ scores were greater at each time point (weeks 8, 28, and 52) for caregivers of patients treated with budesonide compared with caregivers of patients receiving cromolyn sodium. Only the budesonide group met the criterion for a clinically important improvement (>or=0.5 unit change) in all PACQLQ domains by week 8, which was maintained at weeks 28 and 52. Moreover, improvements surpassed the criterion for moderate clinical importance (1.0 unit change) in all PACQLQ domains for the budesonide group, but this level of improvement was only achieved in the activities domain (at week 28) for the cromolyn sodium group. Based on the CCSQ, budesonide resulted in greater caregiver satisfaction, treatment convenience, ease of use, and compliance compared with cromolyn sodium. Thus, 90.7% of caregivers in the budesonide group were 'completely or very satisfied' compared with 53.4% in the cromolyn sodium group. Over half (54.6%) of caregivers in the budesonide group rated budesonide 'highly or very convenient' compared with 23% for cromolyn sodium; 77% rated budesonide 'extremely or very easy' to use compared with 47% for cromolyn. Adherence with daily medication regimens was reported for 76% of children in the budesonide group compared with 57% in the cromolyn sodium group. Child health status, as indicated by mean FS-II(R) scores, showed improvements from baseline in both groups at weeks 8, 28, and 52. There was a trend for these improvements to be superior in the budesonide group. Additionally, budesonide was superior to cromolyn sodium in caregiver and physician global assessments. At the end of the study, 76% of caregivers of children receiving budesonide reported asthma management to be 'a great deal easier' compared with the start of the study, and 74% rated the overall health status of their child as 'much better now than 1 year ago.' In contrast, only 29% and 37% of caregivers whose children received cromolyn sodium provided these respective ratings. CONCLUSIONS: Budesonide inhalation suspension improved the quality of life for caregivers of children with asthma. Caregivers of children treated with budesonide had significantly fewer limitations in daily activities and emotional functioning compared with caregivers of children treated with cromolyn sodium nebulizer solution. The improvements in caregiver quality of life occurred earlier with budesonide compared with cromolyn sodium. Only caregivers in the budesonide group had a clinically important mean change from baseline in all PACQLQ domains by week 8. These benefits were maintained at week 52. Children treated with budesonide inhalation suspension and cromolyn sodium experienced improvements in health status, assessed using the FS-II(R). The greatest differences between treatments were seen in the disease-specific portion of the FS-II(R), which relates impairments in functional status to the child's illness. Caregiver and physician global assessment indicated significantly better overall child health after 1 year of treatment with budesonide, supporting an improvement in health status. Clinical trials in children 4 to 16 years of age with asthma have demonstrated greater effectiveness of inhaled corticosteroids versus cromolyn sodium on several clinical measures of efficacy. Measures of asthma control in this study, reported in detail elsewhere [Leflein et al. Pediatrics 2002;109:866-872], also have shown greater improvements with budesonide therapy. Treatment with budesonide inhalation suspension resulted in a significantly lower mean rate of asthma exacerbations, significantly longer times to first asthma exacerbation, significantly longer times to first additional use of chronic asthma therapy, and significant improvements in asthma symptom scores and breakthrough medication use compared with cromolyn sodium therapy. Additionally, children receiving budesonide inhalation suspension experienced more symptom-free days and episode-free days compared with children receiving cromolyn sodium. Safety profiles were similar between the 2 treatment groups. Budesonide inhalation suspension was associated with significantly greater caregiver satisfaction, convenience, ease of use, and compliance compared with cromolyn sodium nebulizer solution. This greater caregiver satisfaction and quality of life may be related to the greater asthma control achieved in children treated with budesonide therapy compared with cromolyn sodium. In addition, the convenience of once- or twice-daily dosing with budesonide inhalation suspension, compared with 3- or 4-times-daily dosing of cromolyn sodium, may decrease caregiver burden and enhance the willingness of caregivers to adhere to treatment regimens prescribed for their young children with asthma. This effect on caregiver adherence could further improve treatment effectiveness. This is the first clinical trial comparing the effects of a nebulized corticosteroid with that of an alternative nebulized therapy on quality of life in young children with asthma and their families. Compared with nebulized cromolyn sodium, budesonide inhalation suspension not only provides better overall child health status and asthma management, but greater caregiver quality of life and greater caregiver satisfaction, convenience, ease of use, and compliance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthma in childhood has a significant impact on children and families, in part because of the frequent need for hospital-based care for acute exacerbations. Sensitization and exposure to inhalant allergens have been identified as risk factors for asthma hospitalization. OBJECTIVE: The Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP), comprised of 1041 children aged 5 to 12 with mild-to-moderate asthma, provides the opportunity to identify specific risk factors for prior hospitalization for asthma. METHODS: Data gathered during the screening period from CAMP were evaluated to elucidate differences between patients who had ever been hospitalized for asthma before enrollment in CAMP and those who had never been hospitalized. RESULTS: Univariate analyses indicated that prior hospitalization for asthma was associated with a younger age of asthma onset, longer duration of asthma, greater number of positive allergy skin tests, higher serum immunoglobulin E level, greater peripheral blood eosinophilia, greater recent inhaled corticosteroid use, greater airflow obstruction, greater airway hyperresponsiveness, and lower patient intelligence quotient (IQ). Gender, race, and family income did not differ between hospitalized and never-hospitalized patients. The combination of both sensitization and exposure to high levels of dog allergen (Can f1) was associated with greater likelihood of prior hospitalization. Forward multivariate logistic regression analysis identified younger age of asthma onset, longer duration of asthma, recent use of asthma controller therapy, greater airflow obstruction, and lower patient IQ as significant risk factors for prior hospitalization when all risk factors identified by univariate analysis were included in the model. CONCLUSIONS: Children with mild-to-moderate asthma who had a past hospitalization for acute asthma had greater asthma severity, younger age of onset, and lower patient IQ at the time of entry into CAMP. They also had more markers of atopy than children without prior hospitalization, although atopy was not associated with prior hospitalization on multivariate analysis. Although we have identified these risk factors in a retrospective manner, one can speculate that the persistence of these features should alert the clinician to closely follow abnormalities on pulmonary function tests and general features of atopy to potentially identify patients at risk for future hospitalization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite increased attention focused on the need to prevent patient attrition in long-term clinical trials, high dropout rates have threatened the success of numerous studies. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the disease, demographic, and psychological factors associated with missed visits and study dropout to help improve patient management in long-term clinical trials. METHODS: Predictors of attrition were examined within the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP), a large, multicenter clinical trial that followed up 1,041 children with asthma for 4 to 6 years. RESULTS: Eighty-two percent of patients attended all study visits. The tendency to miss visits was increased among older children with milder asthma, lower intellectual and social competence, and more symptoms of behavioral problems and emotional distress. Forty-two patients who missed 3 or more visits in a row and did not attend the final visit were considered study dropouts; these patients at baseline had milder asthma; lower cognitive, academic, and social competence skills; and more family conflict and distress than found among participants who remained in the study. The 49 children who had erratic attendance but did not drop out also had lower intellectual and academic skills and less family social support. CONCLUSIONS: The 4% dropout rate in CAMP was lower than reported in any previous long-term asthma trial. The findings of milder disease, decreased psychological resources, and increased distress in problem-attendance patients can assist in identifying patients who are at risk for missed visits or dropout during the trial either to block their entry into the trial or to focus efforts at maintaining their attendance once enrolled in the trial.

AB  - The 1997 redesign of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) affected US childhood asthma prevalence estimates. The 1997 asthma attack prevalence estimate for children 0-17 years was 5.4%. Pre-redesign NHIS childhood asthma period prevalence estimates peaked in 1995 at 7.5%. It is unclear whether the difference reflects the change in survey methodology or changing asthma prevalence. To examine the impact of the NHIS redesign on childhood asthma prevalence estimates, the authors analyzed the 1988 NHIS that contained two sets of asthma questions: the core survey used until 1996 and the Child Health Supplement (CHS) with questions more similar to those in the redesigned 1997 NHIS. The authors measured the difference between 1988 core and CHS childhood asthma prevalence estimates to calculate an inflation factor for 1997-2000 NHIS estimates. The 1988 CHS questions produced asthma prevalence estimates 19-34% lower than the 1988 core question, depending on the methodology used to assess the difference. Inflating the 1997 asthma attack prevalence estimate by these differences yielded modified 1997 estimates ranging from 6.5% (95% confidence interval: 5.6%, 7.5%) to 7.3% (95% confidence interval: 6.4%, 8.2%). The change in the 1997 NHIS asthma questions likely explains much of the difference in asthma prevalence estimates between 1995 and 1997.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify parental barriers to anti-inflammatory medication use and to develop an instrument for use in research and health care settings to identify at-risk populations. METHODS: Instrument development consisted of 4 phases: 1) gaining the professional perspective (N = 8 experts in asthma management), 2) gaining the perspective of parents of children with asthma (qualitative interviews with 21 parents), 3) instrument pretesting and refinement (N = 133 parents), and 4) determining the instrument's psychometric properties. Study participants were diverse in race, socioeconomic status, and the child's illness severity. The final instrument consisted of 51 questions in 5 domains (nature of disease, cause, ideas about medications, treatment expectations, and health care provider relationship). RESULTS: The final instrument exhibited strong reliability (Cronbach alpha =.87) and validity. Significant barriers to appropriate anti-inflammatory medication use were parents' diminished treatment expectations and fears about anti-inflammatory medications. Minority families were more likely than white families to view asthma as unpredictable and uncontrollable (P =.01) and to have negative attitudes toward anti-inflammatory medications (P =.004). Eight questions were significantly correlated with a suboptimal medication regimen and may serve as a 'quick screen' for potential nonadherence in clinical settings. CONCLUSIONS: Diminished treatment expectations and negative attitudes toward anti-inflammatories may be powerful predictors of nonadherence to medications.

AB  - Study Objective: To quantify lung oxidative stress in asthmatic children by measuring concentrations of 8-isoprostane, a marker of oxidative stress, in exhaled breath condensate (EBC), which is a noninvasive method of sampling airway secretions. Secondary objectives were as follows: (1) to measure levels of exhaled prostaglandin (PG) E(2), since impaired PGE(2) production has been implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma in adults; and (2) to measure levels of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), which is a marker of airway inflammation.Design: Single-center, cross-sectional study.Patients: Twelve healthy children, 12 steroid-naïve asthmatic children, and 30 children in stable condition with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma who were being treated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) [average dose, 300 micro g per day] were studied.Interventions: Subjects attended the outpatient clinic on one occasion for the collection of EBC and FeNO measurements.Measurements and Results: 8-Isoprostane and PGE(2) concentrations in EBC were measured with specific radioimmunoassays. FeNO was measured online by a chemiluminescence analyzer. 8-Isoprostane was detectable in the EBC of healthy children (mean [+/- SEM], 34.2 +/- 4.5 pg/mL), and its concentrations were increased in both steroid-naïve asthmatic children (mean, 56.4 +/- 7.7 pg/mL; p < 0.01) and steroid-treated asthmatic children (mean, 47.2 +/- 2.3 pg/mL; p < 0.05). There was no difference in exhaled 8-isoprostane concentrations between the two groups of asthmatic children (p = 0.14). By contrast, exhaled PGE(2) concentrations were similar among the three study groups (p = 0.56). FeNO levels were higher in steroid-naïve children with asthma (49.2 +/- 9.6 parts per billion [ppb]; p < 0.05) and, to a lesser extent, in steroid-treated asthmatic children (37.8 +/- 6.6 ppb; p < 0.05) compared with healthy children (15.2 +/- 1.7 ppb).Conclusions: Lung oxidative stress is increased in children who are in stable condition with asthma, as reflected by increased exhaled 8-isoprostane concentrations. This increase seems to be relatively resistant to treatment with ICSs. Decreased PGE(2) lung production is unlikely to play a pathophysiologic role in childhood asthma.

AB  - Background: To date, little has been published describing the pathology of severe childhood asthma. The currently accepted model of asthma holds that persistent airway inflammation leads to various symptoms of asthma, airway hyperresponsiveness, and airway remodeling that ultimately results in permanent loss of lung function.Methods: Evaluation of six children referred to the National Jewish Medical and Research Center with difficult-to-control asthma, despite aggressive anti-inflammatory therapy, who underwent bronchoscopy with endobronchial biopsy to better characterize their disease.Results: In every case, endobronchial biopsies revealed changes consistent with airway remodeling characterized by thickening of the basement membrane, smooth-muscle hypertrophy, with varying degrees of goblet-cell and submucous gland hyperplasia. The degree of subbasement membrane thickening did not appear to correlate with baseline FEV(1), ultimate FEV(1) following aggressive therapy, or lability in lung function. In five of six cases, there was minimal to no histologic evidence for airway inflammation with mild and patchy submucosal lymphocytic infiltration noted; eosinophils and neutrophils were not present. Further, the majority of the patients achieved normal FEV(1) values despite significant subbasement membrane thickening, counter to the current beliefs regarding airway remodeling and irreversible loss of lung function.Conclusions: This case report highlights some of the shortcomings of the current inflammatory paradigm for severe asthma. Despite little evidence of ongoing airway inflammation, many of the subjects displayed significant lung function lability. The lack of inflammation argues against steroid resistance at a cellular level, although it could be argued that inflammation may have been distal to the site sampled. Additionally, normal to nearly normal lung function was achieved despite the presence of significant remodeling. These findings suggest the need to look beyond inflammation to fully treat severe asthma and ultimately alter its progression.

AB  - Study Objective: Children from poor families are much more likely to have emergency visits for asthma than those from nonpoor families, which may be related to financial access barriers to good preventive care for the poor. We sought to determine whether in a health-care system that provides free access to outpatient and hospital services, the disparities in the rates of emergency visits for asthma would be less apparent across the income gradient.Design: Longitudinal, population-based study.Setting: Alberta, Canada.Participants: All children born in Alberta, Canada between 1985 and 1988 (n = 90,845) were classified into three mutually exclusive groups based on the reported annual income of their parents from the previous year: very poor, poor, and nonpoor groups.Measurements and Results: We compared the relative risk (RR) of emergency visits for childhood asthma among children of very poor, poor, and nonpoor families using a Cox proportional hazard model during a 10-year follow-up. We found that the very poor children were 23% more likely to have had an emergency visit for asthma than those from nonpoor families (RR, 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14 to 1.33), adjusted for a variety of factors. The poor group, however, had a similar risk of asthma emergency visits as the nonpoor group (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.04). The average number of office visits for asthma was similar between the very poor and nonpoor groups.Conclusions: In a setting of universal access to health care, children of poor and nonpoor families had similar rates of asthma emergency visits; the very poor children, however, continued to experience an excess risk. These findings suggest that a universal health-care system can reduce, but not fully eliminate, the disparities in emergency utilization of asthma across income categories.

AB  - BACKGROUND: No study of childhood asthma prevalence in Alaska or among Alaska Natives has been conducted. OBJECTIVE: To determine asthma prevalence among Alaska Medicaid enrollees younger than 20 years, with an emphasis on Alaska Natives, the state's largest minority and predominant rural citizens. METHODS: A master database was obtained that included all children enrolled in Medicaid during July 1998 through June 1999. Physician, pharmacy, and hospital claims files for International Classification of Diseases codes 493.0x to 493.9x were linked to this master database. Asthma was defined as any asthma-related care or medication claim. RESULTS: Asthma prevalence among the study population was 6.9%. Alaska Natives had a lower asthma prevalence than nonnatives (risk ratio [RR], 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66-0.75), but among the subgroup of children residing in the state's major urban center, Alaska Natives had a higher prevalence. Overall, 0.22% of the study population experienced an asthma-related hospitalization, with Alaska Natives having a higher risk of hospitalization than nonnatives (RR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.3). Among hospitalized children, Alaska Natives were less likely to have received a long-term control medication (RR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.33-0.88). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with nonnatives, Alaska Natives have a lower risk of asthma but only among nonurban residents. The increased risk of hospitalization among Alaska Natives may be related to underuse of long-term control medications.

AB  - AIM: To gauge the importance and relevance placed by general practitioners on components of the National Asthma Campaign's 'Six step' Asthma Management Plan for childhood asthma. METHOD: A cross sectional postal survey of a national randomised sample of 824 GPs. RESULTS: Each component was considered to be 'quite' or 'very' important by at least 70% of respondents. All 11 components were rated to be either 'quite' or 'very' important by 44%, and 91% of respondents considered eight or more of the components to be 'quite' or 'very' important. Two characteristics were consistently associated with the rating of importance: gender, (women GPs generally showing higher ratings), and reported frequency of use of the Asthma Management Plan (frequent users rate importance more frequently). CONCLUSION: There were high levels of endorsement of the Asthma Management Plan for children with asthma.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review discusses the inhalational route as a clinically important route of exposure to food allergens.RECENT FINDINGS: In childhood, we have recently demonstrated that food allergens can induce both early and late phase bronchial reactions within blinded, placebo-controlled challenges. Additionally, clinically important levels of food allergens have been measured in environmental air samples. SUMMARY: It is well known that the ingestion of food allergens frequently causes respiratory symptoms and that the mechanism of death in fatal anaphylaxis is usually profound bronchospasm. The mechanism by which ingested food allergens induce bronchial reactions is unclear. There are many case reports of bronchial reactions to aerosolized food allergens. Within the food industry the problems have been examined more systematically. From such work it is possible to gain an impression of the potential prevalence of the problem. With 10% of adult asthma being occupational and 10% of occupational asthma being induced by aerosolized food, inhalational exposure to food allergens plays a major role in at least 1% of adult asthma. For a patient with co-existent food allergy and asthma it is important that both dietary and environmental avoidance be practised. The similar pathophysiology of allergic and occupational asthma and the ability of inhaled food allergens to cause the latter raises the question as to whether aerosolized food could play a role in the pathogenesis of childhood asthma.

AB  - Aims: To study whether exposure to nitrogen trichloride in indoor chlorinated pools may affect the respiratory epithelium of children and increase the risk of some lung diseases such as asthma.Methods: In 226 healthy children, serum surfactant associated proteins A and B (SP-A and SP-B), 16 kDa Clara cell protein (CC16), and IgE were measured. Lung specific proteins were measured in the serum of 16 children and 13 adults before and after exposure to NCl(3) in an indoor chlorinated pool. Relations between pool attendance and asthma prevalence were studied in 1881 children. Asthma was screened with the exercise induced bronchoconstriction test (EIB).Results: Pool attendance was the most consistent predictor of lung epithelium permeability. A positive dose-effect relation was found with cumulated pool attendance and serum SP-A and SP-B. Serum IgE was unrelated to pool attendance, but correlated positively with lung hyperpermeability as assessed by serum SP-B. Changes in serum levels of lung proteins were reproduced in children and adults attending an indoor pool. Serum SP-A and SP-B were already significantly increased after one hour on the pool side without swimming. Positive EIB and total asthma prevalence were significantly correlated with cumulated pool attendance indices.Conclusions: Regular attendance at chlorinated pools by young children is associated with an exposure dependent increase in lung epithelium permeability and increase in the risk of developing asthma, especially in association with other risk factors. We therefore postulate that the increasing exposure of children to chlorination products in indoor pools might be an important cause of the rising incidence of childhood asthma and allergic diseases in industrialised countries. Further epidemiological studies should be undertaken to test this hypothesis.

AB  - Among children not selected on the basis of a parental history of atopy, day care attendance in early life is inversely associated with asthma at school age. We examined the relation between day care in the first year of life and asthma, recurrent wheezing, and eczema at the age of 6 years and wheezing in the first 6 years of life among 453 children with parental history of atopy followed from birth. Among all study participants, day care in the first year of life was inversely associated with eczema (odds ratio [OR] = 0.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.1-0.8). Day care attendance in early life was associated with a decreased risk of asthma (OR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.1-0.7) and recurrent wheezing (OR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.1-0.9) at the age of 6 years and with a decreased risk of any wheezing after the age of 4 years only among children without maternal history of asthma. Among children with maternal history of asthma, day care in early life had no protective effect on asthma or recurrent wheezing at the age of 6 years but was instead associated with an increased risk of wheezing in the first 6 years of life. Our findings suggest that maternal history of asthma influences the relation between day care-related exposures and childhood asthma.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adequate treatment for asthma depends on accurate assessment and intervention by the parent and child and timely communication with the provider. These actions by the parent may be affected by their understanding of asthma management and their concerns about medications being prescribed. This research reports parental experiences with their children with asthma, specifically their beliefs, knowledge, and attitudes about asthma management, including medication use. METHODS: Data reported are from a study investigating parental attitudes and beliefs affecting antiinflammatory medication use in childhood asthma. These qualitative findings emerged from one-on-one semistructured qualitative interviews with 18 parents of children 2 to 18 years of age who were from diverse racial and socioeconomic backgrounds and who represented the spectrum of illness severity. RESULTS: Eight main themes within the domain of asthma management and medication use were identified: 'I know my child,' 'trial and error,' 'partnership,' 'need for education,' 'negotiating responsibility,' 'hassles with medication administration,' 'preferences,' and 'the benefits outweigh the risks of side effects.' DISCUSSION: These themes emphasize parents' need to partner with providers in their child's asthma management, as well as their need for ongoing asthma education. Parents also expressed concern about adverse effects of antiinflammatory medication but acknowledged the importance of controlling asthma symptoms. Based on these findings, systematic practice changes are recommended that provide regular opportunities for parent and child asthma education in a structured asthma wellness or 'tune-up' visit.

AB  - Background: Medical radiation technologists (MRTs) or radiographers have potential exposure to chemicals including sensitisers and irritants such as glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, sulphur dioxide, and acetic acid.Aims: To determine the prevalence of asthma and work related respiratory symptoms among MRTs compared with physiotherapists, and to identify work related factors in the darkroom environment that are associated with these outcomes.Methods: As part of a two component study, we undertook a questionnaire mail survey of the members of the professional associations of MRTs and physiotherapists in Ontario, Canada, to ascertain the prevalence of physician diagnosed asthma, and the prevalence in the past 12 months of three or more of the nine respiratory symptoms (previously validated by Venables et al to be sensitive and specific for the presence of self reported asthma). Information on exposure factors during the past 12 months, such as ventilation conditions, processor leaks, cleanup activities, and use of personal protective equipment was also collected.Results: The survey response rate was 63.9% among MRTs and 63.1% among physiotherapists. Most analyses were confined to 1110 MRTs and 1523 physiotherapists who never smoked. The prevalence of new onset asthma (since starting in the profession) was greater among never smoking MRTs than physiotherapists (6.4% v 3.95%), and this differed across gender: it was 30% greater among females but fivefold greater among males. Compared with physiotherapists, the prevalence of reporting three or more respiratory symptoms, two or more work related, and three or more work related respiratory symptoms in the past 12 months was more frequent among MRTs, with odds ratios (ORs) (and 95% confidence intervals) adjusted for age, gender, and childhood asthma, of 1.9 (1.5 to 2.3), 3.7 (2.6 to 5.3), and 3.2 (2.0 to 5.0), respectively. Analyses examining latex glove use indicated that this was not likely to account for these differences. Among MRTs, respiratory symptoms were associated with a number of workplace and exposure factors likely to generate aerosol or chemical exposures such as processors not having local ventilation, adjusted OR 2.0 (1.4 to 3.0); leaking processor in which clean up was delayed, 2.4 (1.6 to 3.5); floor drain clogged, 2.0 (1.2 to 3.2); freeing a film jam, 2.9 (1.8 to 4.8); unblocking a blocked processor drain, 2.4 (1.6 to 3.7); and cleaning up processor chemical spill, 2.8 (1.9 to 4.2). These outcomes were not associated with routine tasks unlikely to generate exposures, such as working outside primary workplace, loading film into processor, routine cleaning of processors, or removing processed film. Males reported that they carried out a number of tasks potentially associated with irritant exposures more frequently than females, consistent with the marked increase in risk for new onset asthma.Conclusions: These findings suggest an increase of work related asthma and respiratory symptoms shown to denote asthma among MRTs, which is consistent with previous surveys. The mechanism is not known but appears to be linked with workplace factors and may involve a role for irritant exposures.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether mild-moderate persistent asthma sufficient to produce a decrease in baseline lung function is associated with an adverse effect on growth and bone mineral density (BMD) in children. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 1041 children, 5 to 12 years old (32% ethnic/racial minorities and 40% female), enrolled into the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP). Measures of asthma severity included: Spirometry; bronchial hyperresponsiveness; duration of asthma symptoms; and symptom-based assessment of severity. Multiple regression analyses were used to relate the asthma severity on the primary outcome variables: Height by stadiometry and BMD by dual energy radiographic absorptiometry. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD height percentile was 56.0 +/- 28.5 percentile for the population. The only significant relationship between asthma severity and height percentile was with methacholine bronchoprovocation in girls (beta 2.98, P =.019, covariate multiple regression). The mean +/- SD BMD was 0.65 +/- 0.10 g/cm(2) for the population. The past use of corticosteroids did not adversely affect either growth or BMD. CONCLUSIONS: We found that mild-moderate asthma of as long as 4 to 7 years duration in children does not produce an adverse effect on linear growth or BMD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the measurement of specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to food and/or inhalant allergens in infants who are hospitalized for wheezing can be used to predict later asthma. METHODS: Eighty-two children who were hospitalized for wheezing at <2 years of age were followed prospectively until early school age. The baseline data and the characteristics of infancy had been collected at enrollment. At school age, the children were evaluated for asthma and allergic manifestations, including skin prick tests to common inhalant allergens. Frozen serum samples obtained during the index episode of wheezing were available for 80 children for determination of food and inhalant allergen-specific serum IgE antibodies by fluoroenzyme-immunometric assay, UniCAP, applying the Phadiatop Combi allergen panel. RESULTS: Asthma was present in 32 (40%) children at school age. Food-specific IgE antibodies of >or=0.35 kU/L were found in 37 (46%) wheezing infants, but only specific IgE to wheat and to egg white at the level of >or=0.35 kU/L were significantly associated with later asthma. In regard to specific IgE to the mixture of food allergens, the cutoff level of >or=0.70 proved to be significant. Inhalant allergen-specific IgE of >or=0.35 kU/L was found only in 14 cases (18%), but when present, it was significantly predictive of asthma. Elevated levels of specific IgE antibodies to food or inhalant allergens were significantly associated with allergic rhinitis and skin-test reactivity at school age. CONCLUSIONS: When present in wheezing infants, specific IgE of >or=0.35 kU/L to wheat, egg white, or inhalant allergens are predictive of later childhood asthma. Consequently, detection of those specific IgE antibodies in wheezing infants may facilitate the early diagnosis of asthma, especially in cases with no clinically evident atopic manifestations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthma continues to be a common childhood chronic illness managed principally in primary care. Self-management requires co-ordinated efforts of young people, carers and health professionals. Non-compliance occurs even when parents are supervising care, suggesting that decisions are made on the basis of beliefs that contrast with professional advice. Health professionals therefore need to understand the views of parents (or other carers) and patients to promote good self-management. Little attention has been given to carers' and young people's perspectives on asthma. AIM: To gain insights into the beliefs of a group of 25 young people aged nine to 16 years old and their carers about asthma and its management. DESIGN OF STUDY: Qualitative study using conversational-style interviews. SETTING: Generally deprived urban areas of Greater Manchester. METHOD: Interviews were conducted with 25 young people with asthma and separately with their carers. The interviews were analysed using the principles and procedures of grounded theory. RESULTS: Carers reported assessing asthma symptoms through observed effects on the child and other family members, including emotions and behaviours that disrupted family life. Young people emphasised the effect of asthma on their everyday lives and in particular the extent to which they appeared different to their peers. Some young people reported continuing symptoms and restrictions of activity that differed widely from the reports of their carers. CONCLUSION: Differences between young people's and carers' criteria for assessment suggest explanations for some 'non-compliant' behaviour. Carers' assessment of asthma severity through the absence of acute attacks is consistent with managing asthma as intermittent acute episodes. Professionals should take account of differences between young people's, carers' and professionals' perceptions of asthma.

AB  - Most asthma is mild, intermittent, and usually evaluated during a crisis or asthma attack. Children and adolescents with apparent episodic asthma may have unrecognized chronic symptoms that require elucidation and focused disease management. Severity assessment, which should not be done during an acute exacerbation, can provide a guide to beginning therapy. Updated guidelines include new recommendations for long-term pharmacotherapy. Improved patient outcomes depend on allergy assessment, careful monitoring, and ongoing education of patients arid their families.

AB  - Cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs; LTC[4], LTD[4], and LTE[4]) are important mediators in asthma. LTC[4] is metabolized to less active LTE[4] via LTD[4] by glutamyl transpeptidases and dipeptidases. The enzymatic conversion of LTC[4] to LTE[4] may be a regulatory mechanism in asthma. We examined the conversion rate of LTC[4] to LTE[4] in children it to asthma, and compared it to that in controls. After serum specimens from children with asthma were incubated with exogenous LTC[4] for 30 minutes at 37 degrees C, the levels of LTC[4] and LTE[4] were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Conversion rate of LTC[4] to LTE[4] was significantly lower in children with asthma (67.6 +/- 4.8 LTE[4] ng/mg of protein per minute) than controls (86.8 +/- 4.4 LTE[4] ng/mg of protein per minute). The result indicates that the conversion rate of LTC[4] to LTE[4] may contribute to the pathogenesis of childhood asthma.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether health outcomes of children who have asthma can be improved through the use of an Internet-enabled interactive multimedia asthma education program. METHODS: Two hundred twenty-eight children with asthma visiting a pediatric pulmonary clinic were randomly assigned to control and intervention groups. Children and caregivers in both groups received traditional patient education based on the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program. Intervention group participants received additional self-management education through the Interactive Multimedia Program for Asthma Control and Tracking. Pediatric Asthma Care Knowledge Survey, Pediatric Asthma Caregiver's Quality of Life Questionnaire, asthma symptom history, spirometry, and health services utilization data were collected at the initial visit and at 3 and 12 months. RESULTS: Interactive Multimedia Program for Asthma Control and Tracking significantly increased asthma knowledge of children and caregivers, decreased asthma symptom days (81 vs 51 per year), and decreased number of emergency department visits (1.93 vs 0.62 per year) among the intervention group participants. The intervention group children were also using a significantly lower average daily dose of inhaled corticosteroids (434 vs 754 micro g [beclomethasone equivalents]) at visit 3. Asthma knowledge of all 7- to 17-year-old children correlated with fewer urgent physician visits (r = 0.37) and less frequent use of quick-relief medicines (r = 0.30). CONCLUSIONS: Supplementing conventional asthma care with interactive multimedia education can significantly improve asthma knowledge and reduce the burden of childhood asthma.

AB  - American Indian family caregivers of children with asthma face numerous barriers to effective management of the illness. The purpose of this qualitative, community-based study is to identify those barriers as perceived by family caregivers in a large Midwestern city. An ecological perspective and principles of family-centered care provided the theoretical orientation for the study. Interviews were conducted with 16 urban Ojibwe family caregivers of children with asthma. Five categories of barriers characterize the families' experiences: provider (individual and system), condition-related, family caregiver, socioeconomic, and environmental. Examination of these findings suggests directions for improving care to American Indian children with asthma and their families. Copyright © 2003 by Elsevier Science (USA).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide a literature review of the factors associated with childhood asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits and to identify elements of effective ED interventions that reduce the frequency of childhood ED visits while increasing primary health care utilization. DATA SOURCE: English Medline articles from 1990 that cross-referenced with the terms asthma, emergency, intervention, pediatric, and/or acute care. Experts in the field of allergy and asthma were also consulted. STUDY SELECTION: Childhood asthma interventions in the ED. RESULTS: Factors associated with childhood asthma-related ED visits include being impoverished, being exposed to allergens, receiving Medicaid or lacking insurance, being noncompliant with self-management skills, and having an African-American heritage. Other minorities may also be at risk, but further investigation is required to determine the extent. Attempts to link the patient to primary health care by the ED staff resulted in increased adherence to followup care. CONCLUSIONS: The ED provides an opportunity to help patients and families deal with asthma to improve their quality of life. Further, current studies demonstrate that the ED is an appropriate setting for an intervention that links the patient back to the primary health care provider. More research is needed on the appropriate educational messages to be delivered in ED. Also, barriers to followup care and regular use of a primary health care provider need to be identified so that future intervention designs can address these issues.

AB  - Background: A patient's adherence to an appropriate treatment regimen is necessary to minimize morbidity and mortality associated with childhood asthma. Many factors influence the success of treatment adherence.Objective: The goal of this article was to examine the effect of the mode of medication delivery on the success of treatment adherence in children with asthma.Methods: Relevant clinical studies were identified through a MEDLINE search of articles published from 1966 to 2002, using the search terms adherence, aerosol, asthma, children, compliance, dry powder inhaler, metered-dose inhaler, nebulizer, and pediatric.Results: A relationship seems to exist between treatment adherence and the type of medication delivery system used in childhood asthma. The highest rates of adherence appear to be associated with oral medications.Conclusions: Clinicians should consider the mode of medication delivery as 1 factor that can influence the success of treatment adherence.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this review is to discuss risk factors for asthma development in food allergen-sensitized children. In the paper we discuss the possible measures to prevent progression to asthma by allergen and other adjuvant factor avoidance. DATA SOURCES: A review from literature of articles on these topics was performed. STUDY SELECTION: Relevant publications on asthma risk factors and implementation of protective factors were critically evaluated. RESULTS: Children with familiar history of atopy and sensitization to food proteins in early infancy are at high risk of subsequent respiratory allergic diseases and require specific prevention. Because early allergic sensitization is a significant risk factor for later development of asthma, prevention of asthma by early allergen avoidance is mandatory in high-risk children. Adjuvant factors such as tobacco smoke and mold exposure may act as nonspecific triggers for the development of atopy. The role of protective factors such as infections in early life, breast-feeding, a 'healthy' diet needs to be evaluated in prospective studies. Pharmacologic intervention with antihistamines led to significant reduction in incidence of asthma in high-risk children, but confirmatory longitudinal studies in large populations are necessary. CONCLUSIONS: There is now accumulating evidence that preventing exposure to house-dust mite may significantly reduce the prevalence of childhood asthma. However, allergen avoidance can not be recommended as the only strategy. Avoidance of adjuvant factors and implementation of potential protective factors aimed to reduce the risk to progression to asthma need to be evaluated in prospective studies.

AB  - Background: Beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) has been formulated as an extrafine aerosol (hydrofluoroalkane-134a [HFA]-BDP) [QVAR; 3M Pharmaceuticals; St Paul, MN], which gives improved lung deposition compared with chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-BDP. The clinical efficacy of HFA-BDP has been established in adult asthma at a required dose below that of CFC-BDP, but has not been evaluated in children.Objective: To examine the efficacy and safety of HFA-BDP in childhood asthma.Design: A 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study involving 353 children aged 5 to 12 years with moderate, symptomatic asthma. After a 2-week run-in period, patients were randomized to HFA-BDP, 80 micro g/d (n = 120); HFA-BDP, 160 micro g/d (n = 117); or HFA-placebo (n = 116) administered twice daily.Setting: Hospital outpatient.Results: HFA-BDP, 80 micro g/d and 160 micro g/d, produced a significant, dose-related increase from baseline in FEV(1) percent predicted compared with placebo. At week 12, mean changes from baseline in FEV(1) percent predicted were 9.2% (p < or = 0.01 vs placebo), 10% (p < or = 0.01 vs placebo), and 3.9% for the HFA-BDP 80 micro g/d, HFA-BDP 160 micro g/d, and placebo groups, respectively. There was also a significant decrease in daily beta-agonist use, improvement in peak expiratory flow, and increase [correction] in the percentage of days free from asthma symptoms (p < or = 0.05 for HFA-BDP, 160 micro g/d, vs placebo at weeks 11 to 12). HFA-BDP was well tolerated, with no significant differences in the incidence or nature of adverse events between HFA-BDP and placebo groups. Neither were there significant differences between groups in mean percentage change from baseline in the morning plasma cortisol level at week 12 or in the percentage of patients with morning plasma cortisol levels below the reference range at baseline and week 12. In a subgroup tested, the percentage of patients with an abnormal response to low-dose adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation at week 12 was low and similar among all groups.Conclusions: HFA-BDP, 80 to 160 micro g/d, is effective and safe in childhood asthma.

AB  - Cysteinyl leukotrienes (cys-LTs; LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4) are generated predominantly by mast cells and eosinophils and induce airway smooth muscle contraction, microvascular leakage, and mucous hypersecretion whereas leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a potent chemoattractant of neutrophils. We measured cys-LTs and LTB4 in exhaled breath condensate from children aged 7-14 years including healthy nonatopic children (n = 11) and children with mild intermittent asthma (steroid naive, n = 11), mild persistent asthma (low-dose inhaled steroid treatment, n = 13), or moderate to severe persistent asthma (high-dose inhaled steroid treatment, n = 13). Exhaled LTB4 levels were increased in patients with mild and moderate to severe persistent asthma compared with patients with mild intermittent asthma (126.0 +/- 8.8 and 131.9 +/- 7.1 versus 52.7 +/- 3.8 pg/ml, p < 0.001 and p < 0.0001) and normal subjects (126.0 +/- 8.8 and 131.9 +/- 7.1 versus 47.9 +/- 4.1 pg/ml, p < 0.0001). Elevated exhaled cys-LT levels were found in patients with mild and moderate to severe persistent asthma compared with normal subjects (27.9 +/- 2.8 and 31.5 +/- 4.5 versus 18.5 +/- 0.5 pg/ml, p < 0.01 and p < 0.05). There was an inverse correlation between exhaled cys-LTs and LTB4 in patients with mild persistent asthma. We conclude that exhaled cys-LTs and LTB4 may be noninvasive markers of airway inflammation in pediatric asthma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High levels of serum eosinophil cationic protein (sECP) as a marker of eosinophilic airway inflammation have been described as a predictor of childhood asthma. Bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) appears to be secondary to the release of inflammatory mediators. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the possible correlation between eosinophilic inflammation and BHR in 72 infants with recurrent wheezing. METHODS: To determine bronchial reactivity, lung function measurements with methacholine challenge were performed in 72 infants, aged 12 to 30 months, and the degree of BHR to methacholine was compared with sECP values. Patients were grouped according to low (group 1, <10 microg/L, n = 22), medium (group 2, 10 to 20 microg/L, n = 23), and high (group 3, >20 microg/L, n = 27) sECP values. RESULTS: In group 1, sECP levels ranged from 3.1 to 9.9 microg/L, mean 6.6 microg/L +/- standard deviation [SD] 2.3, in group 2, from 10.3 to 19.8 microg/L, mean 14.3 microg/L +/- SD 2.8, and in group 3 from 23.0 to 66.7 microg/L, mean 34.5 microg/L +/- SD 9.5. Distribution of provocative methacholine concentration among groups was as follows: group 1, 30 to 976 microg, mean 350.9 microg +/- SD 258.3; group 2, 36 to 752 microg, mean 340.7 microg +/- SD 226.3; group 3, 41 to 848 microg, mean 301.3 microg +/- SD 189.8 methacholine. CONCLUSION: There was no significant correlation between sECP levels and bronchial reactivity in all groups (r = -0.076, P = 0.6), indicating that these parameters reflect two independent pathogenic mechanisms in the etiology of childhood asthma.

AB  - Objectives: We describe the system of asthma care in Hartford, CT, an urban, minority community.Methods: The health field concept was used to organize factors influencing asthma prevalence and severity. Data were obtained from national, state, and municipal reports, and from surveys of children in Hartford seeking medical care in an asthma program called Easy Breathing.Results: Between June 1, 1998, and May 1, 2000, 21% of children receiving Medicaid in Hartford did not file a medical claim. Between 1998 and 2000, the number of providers in Hartford decreased by 37% while the number of outpatient visits increased by 8%. Using claims data, we found the following: 19.0% of Hartford children had asthma (data from the International Classification of Disease, ninth revision, and the National Drug Code); and 12% of children with asthma filled a prescription for inhaled corticosteroid therapy, 83% for a bronchodilator, and 36% for an oral corticosteroid. Children with asthma were more likely to be hospitalized (10% vs 5%, respectively) and to visit an emergency department (45% vs 29%, respectively), and, on average, they had more hospital days (0.603 vs 0.415 days per child, respectively) and more outpatient visits per year (4.7 vs 2.5 visits, respectively) compared to children without asthma. Asthma prevalence in the 6,643 children surveyed in the Easy Breathing program was 41%. Persistent asthma was diagnosed in 50% of the children with asthma. Asthma prevalence varied by ethnic origin, age, and gender, and was highest in Hispanic/Puerto Rican children, in children 5 to 10 years of age, in boys up to 10 years of age, and in girls after 15 years of age.Conclusion: Improved personal behaviors and medical care will have a limited sustained impact on childhood asthma until basic environmental issues are modified. The health field concept provides a mechanism with which to address the issues surrounding asthma in urban communities.

AB  - Users' views on health services are increasingly valued, but insufficient attention has been given to evaluations of childhood services. Asthma, the most common chronic childhood disease, is an significant condition around which to explore views of childhood services, especially since most care is provided in the community rather than in hospital. The aim of the present study was to investigate the views of children, young people and their parents on primary care services for childhood asthma, to explain how they should be characterised as evaluators of health services, and to identify the dimensions of care which they see as important. The authors conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 families recruited from responders to a respiratory symptoms questionnaire and from two general practices. Data were analysed using the constant comparative method. Children and young people identified outcomes of care, quality of care, communication and the professional-patient relationship, and organisation and access to healthcare as the key dimensions of their experiences of health services. They were active and critical, judging the performance and delivery of health services against standards which drew on lay knowledge and experience. Parents also emphasised outcomes, quality, organisation and access to healthcare as important, and drew attention to the complex and challenging nature of the professional-parent relationship. Parents had several roles, seeing themselves as carers and advocates as well as users of health services. They also drew on lay standards to evaluate care. Children and young people are willing and able to give active and critical views on health services. Parents' views should also be sought in their own right.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine racial and income disparities in asthma prevalence in US children, and disparities in morbidity and ambulatory health care use among children with asthma. METHODS: Using 1993-1996 National Health Interview Survey data, we measured asthma prevalence and morbidity in children aged 3 to 17 years (N = 14 211) stratifying by race and poverty status. Measures of morbidity included asthma-related activity limitation and number of bed days. We used the ratio of asthma-related doctor contacts to number of bed days in the past 2 weeks to measure health care use adjusted for severity of illness. RESULTS: An annual average of 7.4% of children aged 3 to 17 years had asthma. There were no significant differences in asthma prevalence between race and poverty groups. In contrast, asthma-related morbidity was higher among black and poor children. Black poor children were most likely to have activity limitations due to asthma: 49% were limited compared with about 20% of black nonpoor, white poor, and white nonpoor children. Among children with activity limitations, black children and white poor children were more likely to have severe limitations, and white nonpoor children were least likely. Finally, white nonpoor children had the highest level of ambulatory care use for asthma after accounting for disease severity, and black poor children had the lowest level. CONCLUSIONS: We found no significant racial or income disparities in asthma prevalence among children in the United States. However, black children and poor children are at higher risk for activity limitation, more severe activity limitation, and relative underuse of ambulatory health care. Black children living in poverty are at highest risk. Targeted interventions to reduce the burden of asthma morbidity in this population are likely to reduce disparities in asthma morbidity as well as reduce overall childhood asthma morbidity.

AB  - Asthma is a dynamic disorder of bronchial inflammation, tissue injury and repair, with resulting bronchoconstriction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway obstruction. Genetic predisposition, a decline in infections in early childhood, and exposure and sensitization to environmental allergens all appear to play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma. Elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE) in infancy is associated with onset of the disease later in childhood. Current management strategies for persistent childhood asthma recommend the use of antiinflammatory medications, particularly inhaled corticosteroids. A promising new treatment is based on the neutralization of free IgE by humanized monoclonal anti-IgE antibody (omalizumab).

AB  - Context: Childhood asthma is strongly associated with allergic sensitization. Studies have suggested that animal exposure during infancy reduces subsequent allergic sensitization.Objective: To evaluate the relationship between dog and cat exposure in the first year of life and allergic sensitization at 6 to 7 years of age.Design, Setting, and Subjects: Prospective birth cohort study of healthy, full-term infants enrolled in a health maintenance organization in suburban Detroit, Mich, who were born between April 15, 1987, and August 31, 1989, and followed up yearly to a mean age of 6.7 years. Of 835 children initially in the study at birth, 474 (57%) completed follow-up evaluations at age 6 to 7 years.Main Outcome Measures: Atopy, defined as any skin prick test positivity to 6 common aeroallergens (dust mites [Dermatophagoides farinae, D pteronyssinus], dog, cat, short ragweed [Ambrosia artemisiifolia], and blue grass [Poa pratensis]); seroatopy, defined as any positive allergen-specific IgE test result for the same 6 allergens or for Alternaria species.Results: The prevalence of any skin prick test positivity (atopy) at age 6 to 7 years was 33.6% with no dog or cat exposure in the first year of life, 34.3% with exposure to 1 dog or cat, and 15.4% with exposure to 2 or more dogs or cats (P =.005). The prevalence of any positive allergen-specific IgE test result (seroatopy) was 38.5% with no dog or cat exposure, 41.2% with exposure to 1 dog or cat, and 17.9% with exposure to 2 or more dogs or cats (P =.003). After adjustment for cord serum IgE concentration, sex, older siblings, parental smoking, parental asthma, bedroom dust mite allergen levels at 2 years, and current dog and cat ownership, exposure to 2 or more dogs or cats in the first year of life was associated with a significantly lower risk of atopy (adjusted odds ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.09-0.60) and seroatopy (adjusted odds ratio, 0.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.83).Conclusion: Exposure to 2 or more dogs or cats in the first year of life may reduce subsequent risk of allergic sensitization to multiple allergens during childhood.

AB  - Objectives. Our objective was to use national data to produce a comprehensive description of trends in childhood asthma prevalence, health care utilization, and mortality to assess changes in the disease burden among US children.Methods. Five data sources from the National Center for Health Statistics were used to describe trends in asthma for children aged 0 to 17 years from 1980 to the most recent year for which data were available. These included the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, the National Hospital Discharge Survey, and the Mortality Component of the National Vital Statistics System.Results. Asthma prevalence increased by an average of 4.3% per year from 1980 to 1996, from 3.6% to 6.2%. The peak prevalence was 7.5% in 1995. In 1997, asthma attack prevalence was 5.4%, but changes in the NHIS design in 1997 preclude comparison to previous estimates. Asthma attack prevalence remained level from 1997 to 2000. After a decrease between 1980 and 1989, the asthma office visit rate increased by an average of 3.8% per year from 1989 to 1999. The asthma hospitalization rate grew by 1.4% per year from 1980 to 1999. Although childhood asthma deaths are rare, the asthma death rate increased by 3.4% per year from 1980 to 1998. Children aged 0 to 4 years had the largest increase in prevalence and had greater health care use, but adolescents had the highest mortality. The asthma burden was borne disproportionately by black children throughout the period. Racial disparities were largest for asthma hospitalizations and mortality: compared with white children, in 1998-1999, black children were >3 times as likely to be hospitalized and in 1997-1998 >4 times as likely to die from asthma.Conclusions. Recent data suggest that the burden from childhood asthma may have recently plateaued after several years of increasing, although additional years of data collection are necessary to confirm a change in trend. Racial and ethnic disparities remain large for asthma health care utilization and mortality.

AB  - This study examined patterns in adaptation among parents with a child who had moderate to severe persistent asthma. Specifically, we were interested in examining the differences in adaptation between mothers and fathers in which it was hypothesized that gender effects would be obtained in patterns of coping. Eighty-four parents participated in the study, representing 37 intact families in which both parents were present and 13 single-parent families. Within intact families, mothers exhibited greater efforts than fathers in coping patterns including strategies to acquire social support outside the family, enhance self-worth, and decrease psychological tensions. When compared to mothers in single-parent families, mothers within intact families had a greater tendency to use coping patterns related to family integration and cooperation. Such findings demonstrate a need for additional support for mothers in their role in caring for the chronically ill child. The implications of these findings for clinical practice are discussed.

AB  - There have been few studies of childhood asthma among families who live in nonmetropolitan settings. This work is part of the baseline assessment conducted before implementing a health education program to study the impact of asthma risk factors (gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, asthma severity) on home asthma management. Data analysis yielded no significant differences in home asthma management performed by parents or children with asthma based on the child's gender, ethnicity, asthma severity, or family socioeconomic status. Factors that define the child's experienced asthma pattern, such as activity limitations, number of allergens, and school absenteeism, were associated with the parent's work of asthma management. Trends in the data for the different ethnic and gender subgroups that have implications for clinical practice were identified. Future directions for research to address questions that emerged in this analysis are discussed. Copyright 2002, Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We describe the prevalence of asthma risk factors within racial/ethnic and language groups of infants participating in an intervention study for reducing chronic asthma. METHODS: Low-income children aged 9 to 24 months with 3 or more episodes of wheezing illness were enrolled. Baseline information included family and medical histories, allergic status, environmental exposures, emotional environment, and caregiver psychosocial resources. RESULTS: Racial/ethnic and language groups-European Americans, African Americans, high-acculturated Hispanics, and low-acculturated Hispanics-showed different patterns of risk factors for childhood asthma, with low-acculturated Hispanics showing the most distinctive pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of covariation of biological and psychosocial risk factors for childhood asthma were associated with racial/ethnic and language status among urban, low-income children.

AB  - Asthma is a serious and vexing problem for many children and their families. Asthma, like most syndromes, has many symptoms and potential causes and effects. Studies have shown that pediatric asthma is associated with psychiatric disorders, but the specificity and temporality of these relations is not well known. This study examined the associations between any and specific psychiatric disorders and both childhood asthma and other childhood chronic illnesses. The study used the Methods for the Epidemiology of Child and Adolescent Mental Disorders data, a four-site, community-based study of 1,285 pairs of youths and caretakers. Psychiatric disorders were assessed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC 2.3). Methods for the Epidemiology of Child and Adolescent Mental Disorders was also used to assess individual characteristics, parental reports of asthma, and other chronic illnesses. Asthma and 'other' chronic illnesses were associated with different psychiatric disorders. In particular, having a history of asthma was associated with having an anxiety disorder, after adjustment for potential confounding, but was not associated with having an affective disorder. Having a chronic illness other than asthma or cancer was associated with having any affective disorder and dysthymia but not anxiety disorder. These results call for more mechanistic research that explores the specific relations between childhood anxiety disorder and asthma and between affective disorder and other pediatric chronic illnesses.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Asthma is increasingly being recognized as an important public health concern for children in the United States. Effective management of childhood asthma may require not only improving guideline-based therapeutic interventions, but also addressing social and physical environmental risk factors. The objective of this project was to create a blueprint for improvement of national policy in this area. DESIGN/METHODS: A nominal group process with nationally recognized experts and leaders (referred to as 'the committee') in childhood asthma. RESULTS: The committee identified 11 policy recommendations (numbered in order below) in 2 broad categories: Improving Health Care Delivery and Financing, and Strengthening the Public Health Infrastructure. Recommendations regarding Improving Health Care Delivery and Financing include the development and implementation of quality-of-care standards in 1) primary care, 2) self-management education, and 3) case-management interventions, and the expansion of insurance coverage and benefit design by 4) extending continuous health insurance coverage for all children, 5) developing model insurance benefits packages for essential childhood asthma services, and 6) educating health care purchasers in how to use them. Recommendations for Strengthening the Public Health Infrastructure include public funding of asthma services that fall outside the insurance system through establishing 7) public health grants to foster asthma-friendly communities and 8) school-based asthma initiatives. 9) Launching a national asthma public education campaign, 10) developing a national asthma surveillance system, and 11) establishing a national agenda for asthma prevention research, with an emphasis on epidemiologic and behavioral sciences, are also recommended. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing these recommendations will require coordination of activities at the national, state, and local community level, and within and outside the health care delivery system. With a further commitment of national and local resources, implementation of these recommendations will likely lead to improved child and family asthma outcomes in the United States. childhood asthma, health care policy, health care services.

AB  - Background: Prospective data on the temporal relation between cough, asthma symptoms, and airway inflammation in childhood asthma is unavailable.Aims and Methods: Using several clinical (diary, quality of life), lung function (FEV(1), FEV(1) variability, airway hyperresponsiveness), cough (diary, cough receptor sensitivity (CRS)), and inflammatory markers (sputum interleukin 8, eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP), myeloperoxidase; and serum ECP) of asthma severity, we prospectively described the course of these markers in children with asthma during a non-acute, acute, and resolution phase. A total of 21 children with asthma underwent these baseline tests; 11 were retested during days 1, 3, 7, and 28 of an exacerbation.Results: Asthma exacerbations were characterised by increased asthma and cough symptoms and eosinophilic inflammation. Sputum ECP showed the largest increase and peaked later than clinical scores. Asthma scores consistently related to cough score only early in the exacerbation. Neither CRS nor cough scores related to any inflammatory marker.Conclusion: In mild asthma exacerbations, eosinophilic inflammation is dominant. In asthmatic children who cough as a dominant symptom, cough heralds the onset of an exacerbation and increased eosinophilic inflammation, but cough scores and CRS do not reflect eosinophilic airway inflammation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate symptom evaluation is a critical component of asthma management. Limited data are available about the accuracy of symptom evaluation by children with asthma and their parents, or the impact of various symptom-monitoring strategies on asthma morbidity outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the effect of three different intensities of symptom monitoring on asthma morbidity outcomes. METHODS: One hundred sixty-eight children (ages 6 to 19) of diverse racial, geographic, and socioeconomic backgrounds were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups (subjective symptom evaluation, symptom-time peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) monitoring, daily PEFR monitoring) in this longitudinal, clinical trial. Outcome measures included a summary asthma severity score, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, symptom days, and health care utilization. RESULTS: Children who used PEFR meters (PFMs) when symptomatic had a lower asthma severity score, fewer symptom days, and less health care utilization than children in the other two treatment groups. Minority and poor children had the greatest amount of improvement using PFMs when symptomatic. Results were much less striking in white families. Thirty percent of families in the PFM treatment groups discontinued use entirely by 1 year postexit, whereas the majority of families who continued use (94%) used them only when symptomatic to inform symptom interpretation and management decisions. CONCLUSIONS: Not every child with asthma needs a PFM. Children and families facing extra challenges as a result of illness severity, sociodemographic, or health care system characteristics clearly benefited most from PFM use.

AB  - Background: Despite national guidelines for asthma treatment, many children have troublesome symptoms.Aim: To assess the extent to which the use of inappropriate inhaler devices contributes to this problem.Methods: Of 14 813 questionnaires distributed to schoolchildren, 6996 (47%) were returned identifying 1444 children using asthma inhalers. Inhalers were categorised as age appropriate or inappropriate according to national guidelines and were compared with those used by 75 patients attending a hospital clinic.Results: A total of 35% of "schools" and 4% of "clinic" children reported using an inappropriate inhaler device. Most were using metered dose inhalers alone. Twenty four per cent of "schools" children < or = 5 years old did not use a spacer. Both children and parents overestimated the child's ability to use their inhaler.Conclusions: Large numbers of children are given inhalers they cannot use. To improve asthma care we must ensure that prescriptions reflect the age and ability of the child. Recent recommendations by the Department of Health in England and Wales stress the importance of seamless care between primary and secondary services. As the management of childhood asthma is guided primarily by secondary care providers, it is therefore imperative that general paediatricians know the difficulties and issues which are occurring in the community. This will enable them to lead and support necessary change.

AB  - Concern about the effect of inhaled steroids on growth has inhibited the prescribing of this class of medications for childhood asthma. The weight of findings from an assortment of clinical studies suggests the effect on height is short term, varies by agent, and may be less significant than that of untreated or inappropriately treated asthma.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Peak flow meters (PFMs) in children with moderate to severe asthma have been used to monitor changes in asthma status and inform treatment decisions. However, their usefulness and the likelihood of their long-term use by families remains controversial. METHODS: One hundred sixty-eight children ages 6 to 19 years were enrolled in a longitudinal randomized clinical trial to evaluate the impact of 3 different intensities of symptom monitoring on diverse clinical outcomes: subjective symptom monitoring, symptom-time PFM monitoring, and daily PFM monitoring. RESULTS: At 3 months after the intervention, 90% of parents and 82% of children surveyed perceived a benefit to the monitoring method taught, regardless of group assignment. Ninety-three percent of parents but only 71% of children planned to continue that method. At 1 year after exiting from the study, 69% continued to use a PFM; 30% had discontinued use. No group differences existed in frequency of PFM use between symptom-time and daily users (x = 4.36 vs x = 4.31 times per month). Predictors of continued PFM use included greater frequency of symptoms and younger age. Those discontinuing use believed that it added no additional information to assist in management, using it was a chore/burden, it was not available when needed, and the child's asthma had improved. DISCUSSION: Families will probably use a PFM to inform management during symptomatic times. Daily use is not perceived as useful by most families and is likely to be an unrealistic expectation for most children.

AB  - Recent longitudinal studies have shed light on the pathogenesis and progression of asthma. The patterns of expression of childhood asthma that persist into adult life have been explored. Distinct asthma phenotypes (transient wheezing, nonatopic wheezing, and atopy-associated asthma) have been identified. Defining which children are at risk for persistent asthma could allow for better management and, potentially, for reduced morbidity and mortality.

AB  - It has become clear in the last few decades that the primary underlying pathology of asthma is airway tissue inflammation. In asthma, airway remodeling occurs during chronic inflammation, even in very young children. One of the key goals in treating asthma is to identify those young children with an asthmatic phenotype and initiate early treatment to avoid irreversible airway remodeling. Distinguishing asthma from other conditions that induce wheezing is a daunting but critical step in the appropriate treatment of asthma. In some children, hallmark mediators of inflammation, such as increased eosinophil levels, may distinguish asthma from other causes of wheezing, such as viral infections. Although progress has been made in the differential diagnoses of asthma in young children, more research is needed to define unique markers for distinguishing asthma from other respiratory conditions that produce wheezing.

AB  - In the treatment of childhood asthma, balancing safety and efficacy is key to achieving optimal therapeutic benefit. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), because of their efficacy, remain a cornerstone in managing persistent pediatric asthma, but also are associated with significant adverse effects, including growth suppression. Consequently, careful attention must be given to balancing their safety and efficacy, which should include an understanding of airway patency and systemic absorption (dose, disease severity, propellant and lipophilicity of inhalant), bioavailability (inhalation technique, propellant, delivery devices, and hepatic first-pass metabolism), techniques for using minimum effective doses (dosing time, add-on therapy), and reduction of other exacerbating conditions (allergens, influenza, upper-respiratory diseases). The growth-suppressive effects of ICS may be most evident in children with: 1) mild asthma because the relatively high airway patency may facilitate increased levels of deposition and steroid absorption in more distal airways, and 2) evening dosing that may reduce nocturnal growth hormone activity. A step-down approach targeting a minimum effective dose and once-daily morning dosing is suggested for achieving the most acceptable safety/efficacy balance with ICS. The achievement of regular, safe, and correct ICS use requires significant knowledge and time for both caregiver and patient. Chromones, methylxanthines, long-acting beta-agonists, and leukotriene receptor antagonists are currently available alternatives to ICS for the control of persistent childhood asthma. Chromones are safe but, like methylxanthines, are difficult to use and frequently result in compromised effectiveness. Long-acting beta-agonists are not recommended as monotherapy for persistent asthma. Several factors that support leukotriene receptor antagonists as a therapeutic option for mild-to-moderate persistent pediatric asthma include established efficacy, good safety profiles, and simple, oral dosing. Physicians must evaluate and compare the balance of safety and efficacy for each agent to determine the appropriate asthma therapy for individual patients.

AB  - Although evidence suggests that asthma onset occurs early in childhood, many standard asthma outcome measures are either impractical or unreliable in preschool-aged children. In this population, for instance, patient history and symptom reports rely on the observations of caregivers, who tend to underreport their child's asthma symptoms. Furthermore, the use of conventional measures of pulmonary function such as spirometry may be impractical in very young children. Recent clinical studies have used a variety of techniques to measure symptoms, pulmonary function, and cellular mediators of inflammation. Outcomes such as discontinuation and exacerbation rates, frequency of daytime and nocturnal symptoms, and caregiver assessments of quality of life can be useful measures in evaluating outcomes in young children with asthma. Some measures, such as plethysmography and inflammatory marker analysis, may be suitable options for assessing pulmonary function and predicting asthma susceptibility in preschool-aged children. Indeed, altered levels of inflammatory markers, including immunoglobulin E, interleukin-10, and exhaled nitric oxide, may be useful tools in diagnosing asthma, evaluating interventions, and assessing future risks for asthma symptomatology in very young children. Whether 1 or more of these outcome measures will prove useful clinically in improving the diagnosis and management of childhood asthma remains uncertain, although early research results are encouraging.

AB  - Study Objectives: The contribution of atopy to childhood asthma has been debated. We aimed to examine the relationship between atopy and asthma, taking into account differences in respiratory symptoms and disease severity.Design: A cross-sectional asthma survey involving the following: (1) a population sample of 758 (81% of eligible) school children aged 8 to 10 years from randomly selected schools in the Australian Capital Territory in 1999, and (2) a hospital-based sample of 78 (70% of eligible) children attending the hospital for asthma. Skin-prick test results to 10 common aeroallergens were available on 722 children and 77 children, respectively. Baseline spirometry was obtained on a subset of school children (n = 515, 78% of eligible).Results: The association between atopy and wheeze by wheeze frequency over the past year was as follows: no episodes (odds ratio [OR], 1.00 [reference]), 1 to 3 episodes (OR, 3.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.15 to 4.97), 4 to 12 episodes (OR, 3.44; 95% CI, 1.75 to 6.75), and > 12 episodes (OR, 8.70; 95% CI, 3.07 to 24.55), with a higher population attributable fraction (PAF) for > 12 episodes (75%) than 1 to 3 episodes (49%). Atopy was moderately related to asthma ever (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.52 to 2.85; PAF, 33%) but strongly related to 1999 hospital attendance for asthma (OR, 16.95; 95% CI, 6.76 to 42.48; PAF, 89%). Adjustment for child age, gas heater use, and maternal smoking near the child did not materially alter these findings.Conclusions: The clinical features of frequent wheeze or hospital asthma attendance are largely attributable to atopy, but infrequent wheeze or a history of asthma ever are not. Atopic children are overrepresented in the severe range of the asthma spectrum.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To understand the importance of source of care and other factors that influence differences in asthma medication use by race and Hispanic ethnicity. METHODS: The Childhood Asthma Severity Study provided 12-month, retrospective, parent-reported questionnaire data on a monthly basis for children ages </=12 years in a community sample of 1002 children and their families from Connecticut and Massachusetts. Medications considered included cromolyn, beta2-agonist, inhaled steroids, anticholinergics, theophylline, and systemic steroids. Information was available on demographics, insurance status, symptom severity, primary care contact, and provider practice types. RESULTS: Black and Hispanic children received fewer beta2-agonists, and Hispanic children received fewer inhaled steroids than white children after adjusting for patients' race, age, gender, insurance status, symptom severity, number of primary care visits for asthma, number of urgent visits to the regular provider, family income, maternal education, and site of care. When multivariate analyses were restricted to patients in private practice, the significant association between Hispanic ethnicity and low inhaled steroid use persisted, whereas differences in beta2-agonist use by race and ethnicity changed little but became nonsignificant. CONCLUSION: Even within private practices, patients' race and ethnicity are associated with clinician nonadherence to national guidelines. Programs to eliminate these disparities will need both to focus on site of care and to intervene at the provider and patient levels to be successful.

AB  - Critics of the use of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) in an emergency department (ED) setting believe that they are too cumbersome and time-consuming, but to the best of the authors' knowledge, potential barriers to CPG adherence in the ED have not been prospectively evaluated. OBJECTIVES: To measure provider adherence to an ED CPG based on National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) recommendations, and to determine factors associated with provider nonadherence. METHODS: Prospective, cohort study of children aged 1-18 years with the diagnosis of an acute exacerbation of asthma who were seen in a pediatric ED and requiring admission, as well as a random selection of children discharged to home following pediatric ED care. The following adherence parameters were assessed: at least three nebulized albuterol treatments in the first hour; early steroid administration (after the first nebulizer treatment); clinical assessments using pulse oximetry and peak expiratory flow (PEF) (for children >6 years old); and use of a clinical score to assess acute illness severity (Asthma Severity Score). Nonadherence was defined as any deviation of the above parameters. RESULTS: Between July 1, 1998, and June 30, 1999, 369 patients were studied. Of these, 38% (139) were discharged to home, 38% (140) were admitted to the observation unit, and 24% (90) were admitted to the inpatient unit. Illness severities at initial presentation to the ED were: 24% (86) had mild exacerbations, 59% (212) had moderate exacerbations, and 17% (62) had severe exacerbations. Sixty-eight percent (95% CI = 63% to 73%) of the patients were managed with complete adherence to the CPG. Of the 32% with some form of nonadherence, most (63%) were children older than 6 years; in this group 64% (48/75) were nonadherent due to lack of PEF assessment. When PEF assessment was disregarded, an 83% (95% CI = 79% to 87%) adherence to the CPG was achieved. Other nonadherence factors included: lack of at least three nebulized albuterol treatments provided timely within the first hour (5%); delay in steroid administration (6%); lack of pulse oximeter use (0.5%); and failure to record clinical score to assess severity (1.1%). Patient age, illness severity (acute and chronic), first episode of wheezing, and high ED volume periods (evenings and weekends) did not worsen adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical practice guidelines can be used successfully in the pediatric ED and provide a more efficient management and treatment approach to acute exacerbations of childhood asthma. With a systematic and concise CPG, barriers to adherence in a pediatric ED appear to be minimal, with the exception of using PEF in the routine ED assessment.

AB  - Asthma has become the most common chronic illness among children. Indoor environments appear to play a substantial role in the development of asthma. Recent studies indicate strong evidence of a causal relationship between exposure to certain indoor environmental pollutants and development and/or exacerbation of asthma in susceptible individuals. Allergens of concern include those produced by dust mites, cockroaches, cats, dogs, and molds. It is important to better understand this relationship and take preventive and corrective steps to reduce or eliminate these sources in schools, homes, and day care centers. Measures include tracking of asthma and allergic response incidents; monitoring for the presence of allergens and molds; effective cleaning procedures; prompt repair of water leaks and/or moisture problems; control of indoor relative humidity; and proper operation of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: It is well known that asthmatic children receiving Medicaid use the emergency department (ED) more frequently than otherwise-insured asthmatic children. However, the extent to which this difference is attributable to provider characteristics, medication use, access to primary care, and symptomatology is poorly understood. These factors were explored as independent predictors of health care utilization. METHODS: Baseline data from a prospective cohort study of childhood asthma severity were used. Subjects were recruited from seven New England hospitals. Home interviews collected data on monthly symptoms, health care visits, insurance status, as well as sociodemographics and asthma-related risk factors (n = 804). Characteristics of providers' practices, board certifications, and asthma specialty were obtained from Folio's Medical Dictionaries for Connecticut and Massachusetts. RESULTS: After adjusting for frequency of asthma-related primary care visits, primary provider practice type, use of asthma specialist, age, gender, medication use, and symptomatology, Medicaid children still used the ED more frequently for asthma services than privately insured children (RR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1, 2.5). In general, race/ethnicity did not modify the relationship between insurance status and health care use, except that black children receiving Medicaid were 90% (95% CI, 0.0, 0.7) less likely to have had > or = 3 routine primary care visits for asthma in the previous year than black privately insured children. White children receiving Medicaid were 2.5 (95% CI, 1.0, 6.9) times more likely to use the ED for asthma than privately insured white children. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that enabling, structural, and need factors do not necessarily explain observed differences in pediatric asthma health care use by insurance status. Future investigation must explore other explanatory factors such as maternal attitudes and beliefs and patient-provider communication.

AB  - BackgroundReport on the characteristics of a cohort of children, aged 7-9 years, attending schools in the south of England and participating in a controlled intervention study to improve the care and knowledge of asthma in junior and primary schools and highlight problems for potential intervention.MethodsA survey employing the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) asthma questionnaire was undertaken to record the prevalence of asthma and the characteristics of children with asthma and wheeze in Year 3 and 4 pupils (age 7-9 years) in 25 schools, and to define disease severity and its management.ResultsResponses on 1732 children were received. Reports of asthma and wheeze in this study were similar to those in recent ISAAC studies. The frequency and severity of symptoms was associated with appropriate therapeutic intervention suggesting adherence to published British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines. However, 80% of children with asthma at any BTS level of treatment reported exercise-induced wheeze, indicating a need for education on pre-exercise inhaler use. One in 20 children who had wheezed in the past 12 months reported a symptom profile suggestive of unrecognised asthma. Significant associations were found between maternal smoking and both wheeze in the last 12 months [odds ratio (OR), 1.35; confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.81, p < 0.05] and nocturnal cough [OR, 1.70; CI: 1.31-2.20, p < 0.001].ConclusionsThe characteristics of this sample are similar to those found for children of a similar age group in other studies. Therapeutic intervention is appropriate for the severity of disease but there are high levels of exercise-induced wheeze despite adequate control of other symptoms. Five percent of children who reported wheezing in the previous 12 months had a symptom profile of untreated asthma. Maternal cigarette smoking was associated with wheeze and cough.Implications for practicRecurrent untreated wheeze remains a problem for 5% of children reporting wheeze. A therapeutic hole has been identified - there is a need for further education on pre exercise inhaler use. Both these problems could be addressed by a school-based asthma management strategy. Maternal smoking and its effects on childhood asthma and wheeze need to be addressed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood asthma continues to be a growing medical concern in the United States, affecting > 17 million children in 1998. The mortality rate from asthma in children aged 5 to 14 years has nearly doubled, from 1.7 deaths per million to 3.2 deaths per million between 1980 and 1993. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to rate problem-based strategies for asthma management in a defined population of children. METHODS: The participants in our study were recruited from a local inner-city medical facility in Los Angeles. The majority of participants had received the diagnosis of mild-to-moderate-persistent asthma. Each participant was given 10 asthma-based problems and asked to manage them. Each management decision and its order were entered into a database. This database was used to train an artificial neural network (ANN). The trained ANN was then used to cluster the various performances, and outputs were evaluated graphically. RESULTS: Three hundred five performances were analyzed through our trained neural network. Our ANN classified five major clusters representing different approaches to solving an acute asthma case. CONCLUSIONS: ANNs can build rich models of complex phenomena through a training and pattern-recognition process. Such networks can solve classification problems with ill-defined categories in which the patterns are deeply hidden within the data, and models of behavior are not well defined. In our pilot study, we have shown that ANNs can be useful in automating evaluation and improving our understanding of how children manage their asthma.

AB  - Background: Little is known about factors determining the pathogenesis and severity of asthma in Latin American countries. Costa Rica, one of the most prosperous Latin American nations, has a very high asthma prevalence.Objective: To examine the relation between potential risk factors and childhood asthma in Costa Rica.Methods: Cross-sectional study of 214 schoolchildren aged 10 to 13 years participating in phase II of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood.Results: After adjustment for age, gender, area of residence, maternal smoking during pregnancy, and airway responsiveness to hypertonic saline solution, sensitization to house dust mites was associated with asthma (odds ratio [OR], 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 4.4; p = 0.02). In the multivariate analysis, parental education no higher than high school (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.4 to 6.4; p < 0.01) and parental history of asthma (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.3 to 5.2; p < 0.01) were also independent predictors of childhood asthma.Conclusions: Sensitization to house dust mites, low parental education, and parental history of asthma are associated with asthma in Costa Rica.

AB  - The incidence and severity of asthma are increasing despite concerted efforts in comprehensive management. Families may be expected to look to complementary or alternative therapies (CAM) for help in treating persistent childhood asthma. One such therapy is homeopathy, a system of medicine that uses specially prepared, highly dilute substances to induce the body's self-healing in a comprehensive manner. This article describes the contrasting experiences for a family who undergoes specialty consultations with an allergist and with a homeopath. The style of the interview and the diagnostic tools used vary, as well as the basic philosophies and goals. The advantages and limitations, as well as the regulatory framework of homeopathy are explained, as evidenced by the literature. For nurses and other clinicians caring for children and families who use nonconventional therapies, the clinical implications are that these professionals need to become knowledgeable about the various alternative therapies which can complement conventional care. Families who wish to try homeopathy along with conventional care need to have open lines of communication and cooperation between their providers, both conventional and homeopathic. The care of childhood asthma may prove to benefit from clinical trials in homeopathy.

AB  - Background: The protective effect of breast-feeding on the development of childhood asthma remains a matter of controversy. We conducted a systematic review of prospective studies that evaluated the association between exclusive breast-feeding during the first 3 months after birth and asthma.Study Design: We searched the 1966-1999 MEDLINE database and reviewed reference lists of relevant articles to identify 12 prospective studies that met pre-stated inclusion criteria. Methodological aspects of the studies, duration and exclusivity of breast-feeding, and outcomes were assessed. Effect estimates were abstracted by the investigators, using a standardized approach.Results: The summary odds ratio (OR) for the protective effect of breast-feeding was 0.70 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.81). The effect estimate was greater in studies of children with a family history of atopy (OR = 0.52) than in studies of a combined population (OR = 0.73).Conclusions: Exclusive breast-feeding during the first months after birth is associated with lower asthma rates during childhood. The effect, caused by immunomodulatory qualities of breast milk, avoidance of allergens, or a combination of these and other factors, strengthens the advantage of breast-feeding, especially if a family history of atopy is present.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Using an asthma model, specific research questions of this pilot study were (a) How does the production of Th1- and Th2-type cytokines in college students change in response to the natural stressor of final examinations? (b) Are there differences in cytokine production and psychological responses between students with and without a history of childhood asthma? and (c) What are the relationships among different types of cytokines and perceived levels of the psychological state (stress, anxiety, and depression)?DESIGN: Pilot study.SETTING: College.POPULATION: The sample consisted of 24 college students, including 13 students who reported a history of childhood asthma and 11 students without a history of childhood asthma.INTERVENTIONS: Data were collected twice: once during midsemester (baseline) and again during the final examination week (exam). At each data collection time students gave a blood sample and completed a set of questionnaires. Levels of cytokine production were measured in two ways. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) described behavioral manifestations of depression. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) examined potential changes in anxiety during two discrete academic events. Stress level was measured with the Perceived Stress Scaled (PSS). Test-specific attitude/anxiety was measured with the Test Attitude/Anxiety Inventory (TAI).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Significant changes were noted in several cytokine levels between baseline and the final examination period. Students reported significantly higher levels of stress and state anxiety during the examination period. Students with a history of childhood asthma showed significantly higher levels of IL-5 than those without a history of asthma. Psychological responses did not differ between the two groups in any measure.RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Cytokine responses to stress are an important area of research, particularly in populations whose disease activities can be modulated by cytokine mechanisms. Using larger samples, future investigations should include stress-induced changes in Th1- and Th2-type cytokines as well as relevant assessments of disease activities that can be correlated to cytokine changes. Then appropriate interventions for reducing stress can be tested. [CINAHL abstract]

AB  - Many risk factors for asthma have been proposed including age, gender (male), smoking, and family history of asthma. The importance of breastfeeding to childhood asthma is a controversial issue. The present study investigated the relation between breastfeeding and the prevalence of asthma among a childhood population. The subjects were 25,767 students, representing all public elementary and junior high schools in Tokorozawa, Japan (age range, 6--15 years). The study population included 2,315 students with asthma and 21,513 controls. Participants' parents completed the Japanese version of the American Thoracic Society and Division of Lung Diseases, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, questionnaire for children adopted by the Japanese Environmental Agency in 1998. The authors added supplementary questions on the parental history of asthma and feeding patterns from the age of 0--3 months. The risk of breastfeeding for asthma was compared with that of artificial feeding. After adjustment for age, gender, parental smoking status, and parental history of asthma, a significantly higher prevalence of asthma was noted among children who had been breastfed (adjusted odds ratio = 1.198; 95% confidence interval: 1.054, 1.363; p for trend < 0.01). The results indicated that breastfeeding in infancy might be related to the higher prevalence of asthma during preadolescence.

AB  - It has been suggested that asthmatic children may have a higher caries risk, both as a result of their medical condition and the physical and physiological effects of their pharmacotherapy. By examining the association over time between asthma and caries increment, this study tested the hypothesis that childhood asthma is associated with an increased caries increment. In a long-standing New Zealand cohort study, participants' long-term asthma histories and the 3-year net caries increment between the ages of 15 and 18 years were examined. Of the 781 who were examined at 15 and 18 years, 39 participants were consistently taking anti-asthma medication at the ages of 9, 11, 13 and 15 years (and were labelled in this study as 'medication-determined asthmatics'), 56 were identified as consistent wheezers at the ages of 9, 11, 13 and 15 years ('wheeze-determined asthmatics') and 36 were members of both groups. A smaller group (n = 9) was identified as being very-long-term asthmatics (asthma at 5 years of age and at the ages of 9, 11, 13 and 15 years). Some 206 study members were identified as having no history of asthma, asthma medication or significant wheeze at any time up to and including 18 years. The overall mean net caries increment between the ages of 15 and 18 years was 2.06 surfaces (SD, 3.76). There were no significant differences in caries increment between the 206 asthma-free participants and any of the asthma groups. This study provides little evidence for an asthma-caries causative relationship.

AB  - This study explored the potential association between childhood asthma and caries using oral examination and health interview data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1988-1994 (NHANES III). We fitted GEE Poisson regression models with adjustment for parents' income, gender, race, exposure to potentially xerostomic drugs, and the presence of pit and fissure sealants. There was no association between the use of drugs commonly used by asthmatics (antihistamines, corticosteroids, and antiasthmatic inhalers) and df/DMF scores. Asthmatic children 4-10 years of age at all severity levels had similar dfs scores to the controls, however, severely asthmatic children 4-10 years of age had significantly lower DMFS (p = 0.010) and DMFT (0.049) scores than controls. Similarly, severely asthmatic children 11-16 years of age had significantly lower DMFT scores than controls (p = 0.024) and DMFS scores approaching statistical significance (p = 0.053). While our analysis adjusted for covariates, potential confounders such as fluoride intake from water, diet, use of topical fluorides, and dose of antiasthmatic medication could not be addressed. Our results indicate that any association between asthma and dental caries may occur primarily in younger children with no evidence of an association between asthma and dental caries as children mature.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The role of viral respiratory tract infections in the onset of childhood asthma and allergy is controversial, partly because of limited understanding about postnatal viral exposures. We investigated the prevalence of 3 common respiratory viruses and associated respiratory symptoms in 2-week-old infants at high risk for having asthma and allergy. STUDY DESIGN: Frozen nasal specimens from 2-week-old children at high risk (n = 495) underwent reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for picornavirus-, parainfluenza-, and respiratory syncytial virus-specific nucleic acid. RT-PCR findings were related to respiratory symptoms (cold, cough, and wheeze) and to characteristics implicated with increased risk for asthma and allergy. RESULTS: Viral RT-PCR was positive in 199 (40.2%) of 495 specimens examined, with picornavirus and parainfluenza significantly associated with respiratory symptoms. Viral prevalence was significantly higher in children born during the winter and summer months. CONCLUSIONS: A high percentage (40.2%) of infants at high risk for asthma and allergy had been exposed to common respiratory viruses at 2 weeks of age. RT-PCR is a powerful diagnostic method that can be used in epidemiologic studies examining the role of viral respiratory tract infections in the pathogenesis of pediatric asthma and allergy.

AB  - Context: Despite the substantial amount of health-related information available on the Internet, little is known about the accessibility, quality, and reading grade level of that health information.Objective: To evaluate health information on breast cancer, depression, obesity, and childhood asthma available through English- and Spanish-language search engines and Web sites.Design and Setting: Three unique studies were performed from July 2000 through December 2000. Accessibility of 14 search engines was assessed using a structured search experiment. Quality of 25 health Web sites and content provided by 1 search engine was evaluated by 34 physicians using structured implicit review (interrater reliability >0.90). The reading grade level of text selected for structured implicit review was established using the Fry Readability Graph method.Main Outcome Measures: For the accessibility study, proportion of links leading to relevant content; for quality, coverage and accuracy of key clinical elements; and grade level reading formulas.Results: Less than one quarter of the search engine's first pages of links led to relevant content (20% of English and 12% of Spanish). On average, 45% of the clinical elements on English- and 22% on Spanish-language Web sites were more than minimally covered and completely accurate and 24% of the clinical elements on English- and 53% on Spanish-language Web sites were not covered at all. All English and 86% of Spanish Web sites required high school level or greater reading ability.Conclusion: Accessing health information using search engines and simple search terms is not efficient. Coverage of key information on English- and Spanish-language Web sites is poor and inconsistent, although the accuracy of the information provided is generally good. High reading levels are required to comprehend Web-based health information.

AB  - Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways that affects 5 million American children. In the past decade, asthma morbidity has dramatically increased. This increase is particularly apparent in poor minority inner-city children. School-based health centers offer a conveniently located setting for the acute treatment and long-term management of childhood asthma. Treatment of asthma using the most recent management guidelines offered in a school setting should result in a decrease in the morbidity and mortality associated with pediatric asthma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Budesonide and sodium cromoglycate are both recommended as maintenance therapy for childhood asthma. OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of these two treatment strategies in clinical practice, in an open-label, pharmacoeconomic clinical trial. METHODS: Health economics were evaluated in 138 children, ages 5 to 11 years, with unstable asthma not previously treated with corticosteroids or cromones. The asthma was stabilized during 4 to 6 weeks with budesonide 200 to 400 microg twice daily. The children were then randomly allocated to one of the two treatment strategies aiming at maintaining asthma control for 12 months; budesonide 400 microg/day (N = 69) or sodium cromoglycate 60 mg/day (N = 69). If asthma control was judged unsatisfactory, the doses were increased or the children were switched to the alternate treatment. RESULTS: In children continuing on the same treatment, the degree of asthma control was similar in the two groups at study end. To maintain asthma control, 42% of cromoglycate children switched to budesonide, and then experienced a 14% increase in symptom-free days. No budesonide patient had to switch therapy because of lack of asthma control. Although not statistically significant, total annual cost per patient was 24% (Swedish kronor 4195; US $487; Euro 485) lower in the budesonide than the cromoglycate group, mainly due to a lower cost for asthma medication. CONCLUSIONS: A budesonide strategy for continued maintenance treatment, after an initial period of stabilizing treatment with budesonide, resulted in lower costs and less drug switches than did a strategy with sodium cromoglycate.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although there are current measures to evaluate childhood asthma severity for clinical diagnosis and treatment, there is no standard valid measure to evaluate childhood asthma severity for large-scale epidemiologic studies. OBJECTIVES: To develop and test a childhood asthma severity scale (CHAS) for clinimetric validity and to determine differences in symptoms, medication use, and health care visits by participant characteristics. METHODS: Eight hundred ninety-seven actively asthmatic children under the age of 12 years were selected from a general population of children. Children were selected from a screening questionnaire administered at six Connecticut hospitals that serve large minority populations in Bridgeport, New Haven, Hartford, and Danbury and one hospital serving south central Massachusetts. Twelve-month baseline data for a prospective cohort study of childhood asthma severity were collected on a monthly basis through home interviews. Home interviews addressed questions on daily symptoms, medication use, and health care visits. A severity scale was constructed using three dimensions: symptoms, medication use, and health care visits. RESULTS: CHAS has sufficient preliminary content, construct, and predictive validity. Despite similarities in symptoms, there were health care utilization and medication differentials according to race and ethnicity, insurance status, family income, and maternal education. CONCLUSIONS: CHAS is a potentially useful measure of asthma severity for large-scale epidemiologic studies. It seems that CHAS has sufficient clinimetric properties.

AB  - Objective. Although the efficacy of inhaled antiinflammatory therapy in improving symptoms and lung function in childhood asthma has been shown in clinical trials, the effectiveness of these medications in real-world practice settings in reducing acute health care use has not been well-evaluated. This study examined the effect of inhaled antiinflammatory therapy on hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits by children for asthma. Design. Defined population cohort study over 1 year. Setting. Three managed care organizations (MCOs) in Seattle, Boston, and Chicago participating in the Pediatric Asthma Care-Patient Outcome Research and Treatment II trial. Participants. All 11 195 children, between 3 to 15 years old, with a diagnosis of asthma who were enrolled in the 3 MCOs between July 1996 and June 1997. Outcome Measures. We identified children with 1 or more asthma diagnoses using automated encounter data. Medication dispensings were identified from automated pharmacy data. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to calculate effects of inhaled antiinflammatory therapy on the adjusted relative risk (RR) for hospitalization and ED visits for asthma. Results. Over 12 months, 217 (1.9%) of children had an asthma hospitalization, and 757 (6.8%) had an ED visit. After adjustment for age, gender, MCO, and reliever dispensing, compared with children who did not receive controllers, the adjusted RRs for an ED visit were: children with any (>/=1) dispensing of cromolyn, 0.4 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.3, 0.5); any inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), 0.5 (95% CI: 0.4, 0.6); any cromolyn or ICS combined (any controller), 0.4 (95% CI: 0.3, 0.5). For hospitalization, the adjusted RR for cromolyn was 0.6 (95% CI: 0.4, 0.9), for ICS 0.4 (95% CI: 0.3, 0.7), and for any controller 0.4 (95% CI: 0.3, 0.6). A significant protective effect for both events was seen among children with 1 to 5 and with >5 antiinflammatory dispensings. When the analysis was stratified by frequency of reliever dispensing, there was a significant protective effect for controllers on ED visits for children with 1 to 5 and with >5 reliever dispensings and on the risk of hospitalization for children with >5 reliever dispensings. Conclusions. Inhaled antiinflammatory therapy is associated with a significant protective effect on the risk for hospitalization and ED visits in children with asthma. Cromolyn and ICSs were associated with similar effects on risks, asthma drug therapy, inhaled antiinflammatory agents, health maintenance organizations, hospitalization, emergency department.

Children were followed long-term for the development of asthma.Patients: Fourteen children with bronchiolitis (mean age, 0.7 years) and 48 with wheezy bronchitis (mean age, 2.3 years) were enrolled. For comparison, 40 children with asthma (mean age, 4.6 years) and 27 healthy control subjects without chronic respiratory disease (mean age, 2.7 years) were studied.Measurements: Consecutive doses of methacholine were doubled until a 10% decrease in tcPO(2) from baseline was reached. The cumulative dose of methacholine (Dmin) at the inflection point of tcPO(2) (Dmin-PO(2)) was recorded.Results: During > 10 years of follow-up, seven patients with bronchiolitis developed asthma and all patients in the higher BRm set developed asthma, compared with none in the lower BRm set. In the wheezy bronchitis group, Dmin-PO(2) values in the 32 patients who developed asthma were lower than those in patients who had not developed asthma (p < 0.001).Conclusions: We concluded that there is a tendency for infants with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis or wheezy bronchitis and who show BHR in the infantile period to develop asthma. The presence of increased BHR after infantile respiratory diseases associated with wheezing may be a prelude to the development of childhood asthma.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Residential exposures are recognized risk factors for childhood asthma, but the relative contribution of specific risk factors and the overall contribution of housing to asthma in US children is unknown. The objective of this study was to identify risk factors and estimate the population attributable risk of residential exposures for doctor-diagnosed asthma for US children. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from 1988 to 1994. Survey participants were 8257 children who were <6 years old and who participated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a survey of the health and nutritional status of children and adults in the United States. The main outcome measure was doctor-diagnosed asthma, as reported by the parent. RESULTS: Six percent of children had doctor-diagnosed asthma. The prevalence of asthma was higher among boys (6.7%) than girls (5.1%) and was higher among black children (8.9%) than white children (5.2%). Risk factors for doctor-diagnosed asthma included a family history of atopy (odds ratio [OR]: 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5, 3.1), child's history of allergy to a pet (OR: 24.2; 95% CI: 8.4, 69.5), exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (OR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.2-2.6), use of a gas stove or oven for heat (OR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.02-3.2), and presence of a dog in the household (OR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.1, 2.3). The population attributable risk of >/=1 residential exposure for doctor-diagnosed asthma in US children <6 years old was 39.2%, or an estimated 533 000 excess cases, whereas having a family history of atopy accounted for 300 000. The attributable cost of asthma as a result of residential exposures for children <6 years old was $402 million (95% CI: $296-$507 million) annually. CONCLUSIONS: The elimination of identified residential risk factors, if causally associated with asthma, would result in a 39% decline in doctor-diagnosed asthma among US children <6 years old.

AB  - Context: Vehicle exhaust is a major source of ozone and other air pollutants. Although high ground-level ozone pollution is associated with transient increases in asthma morbidity, the impact of citywide transportation changes on air quality and childhood asthma has not been studied. The alternative transportation strategy implemented during the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, Ga, provided such an opportunity.Objective: To describe traffic changes in Atlanta, Ga, during the 1996 Summer Olympic Games and concomitant changes in air quality and childhood asthma events.Design: Ecological study comparing the 17 days of the Olympic Games (July 19-August 4, 1996) to a baseline period consisting of the 4 weeks before and 4 weeks after the Olympic Games.Setting and Subjects: Children aged 1 to 16 years who resided in the 5 central counties of metropolitan Atlanta and whose data were captured in 1 of 4 databases.Main Outcome Measures: Citywide acute care visits and hospitalizations for asthma (asthma events) and nonasthma events, concentrations of major air pollutants, meteorological variables, and traffic counts.Results: During the Olympic Games, the number of asthma acute care events decreased 41.6% (4.23 vs 2.47 daily events) in the Georgia Medicaid claims file, 44.1% (1.36 vs 0.76 daily events) in a health maintenance organization database, 11.1% (4.77 vs 4.24 daily events) in 2 pediatric emergency departments, and 19.1% (2.04 vs 1.65 daily hospitalizations) in the Georgia Hospital Discharge Database. The number of nonasthma acute care events in the 4 databases changed -3.1%, +1.3%, -2.1%, and +1.0%, respectively. In multivariate regression analysis, only the reduction in asthma events recorded in the Medicaid database was significant (relative risk, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, 0.44-0.86). Peak daily ozone concentrations decreased 27.9%, from 81.3 ppb during the baseline period to 58.6 ppb during the Olympic Games (P<.001). Peak weekday morning traffic counts dropped 22.5% (P<.001). Traffic counts were significantly correlated with that day's peak ozone concentration (average r = 0.36 for all 4 roads examined). Meteorological conditions during the Olympic Games did not differ substantially from the baseline period.Conclusions: Efforts to reduce downtown traffic congestion in Atlanta during the Olympic Games resulted in decreased traffic density, especially during the critical morning period. This was associated with a prolonged reduction in ozone pollution and significantly lower rates of childhood asthma events. These data provide support for efforts to reduce air pollution and improve health via reductions in motor vehicle traffic.

AB  - Measurement of health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) is a key ingredient in clinical research and comprehensive disease management programs. Choosing the appropriate instrument and administration method that fit each particular situation is vital to the success of HR-QOL evaluations, particularly in those involving children. There are a number of generic paediatric HR-QOL instruments and, in certain disease states such as childhood asthma, a significant amount of work has been done to develop valid and reliable disease-.specific HR-QOL instruments. However, the effect of chronic disease and treatment on children's HR-QOL and development requires further study.

AB  - Childhood asthma remains underdiagnosed in general practice. Computers with a patient interface have the potential to screen children for asthma in a time-efficient manner. To develop a concise, validated self-report measure that calculates an 'asthma score' that predicts likelihood of asthma and its severity in childhood. Computerised questionnaire survey in general practitioners' (GPs') waiting rooms, followed by a written questionnaire and either bronchial challenge or skin allergy testing at the regional teaching hospital. Children between 18 months and 18 years old accompanied by a parent or guardian in five group practices in Newcastle in New South Wales, Australia. The responses from both the computerised questionnaire and the written questionnaire were compared with physician assessment of asthma, based on an existing validated questionnaire and clinical tests. Six items were identified to be independently and significantly associated (at P < 0.05) with the presence of asthma and its severity: parent or self-reported asthma, previous diagnosis, wheeze in the past year, physical activity affected by symptoms, night cough in the past year, and visits to a GP in the past year. From the regression model a linear score was derived that indicates whether a child is likely to have asthma and its likely severity. The asthma score is a valid indicator of asthma and its severity in children in general practice.

AB  - The results presented in this review suggest that the impact of nutrition on obstructive lung disease is most evident for antioxidant vitamins, particularly vitamin C and, to a lesser extent, vitamin E. By decreasing oxidant insults to the lung, antioxidants could modulate the development of chronic lung diseases and lung function decrement. Antioxidant vitamins could also play an important role in gene-environment interactions in complex lung diseases such as childhood asthma. Data also suggest that omega-3 fatty acids may have a potentially protective effect against airway hyperreactivity and lung function decrements; however, relevant data are still sparse. Although epidemiologic data suggest that consumption of fresh fruit may reduce risk of noncarcinogenic airway limitation, there are no clear data on which nutrients might be most relevant. While some studies evaluate daily intake of vitamin C, other studies use fruit consumption as a surrogate for antioxidant intake. Given the dietary intercorrelations among antioxidant vitamins, particularly vitamin C, beta-carotene, and flavonoids, as well as other micronutrients, it may be difficult to isolate a specific effect. Some population subgroups with higher levels of oxidative stress, such as cigarette smokers, may be more likely to benefit from dietary supplementation, since some studies have suggested that antioxidant intake may have a greater impact in this group. Studies of lung function decrement and COPD in adults suggest that daily intake of vitamin C at levels slightly exceeding the current Recommended Dietary Allowance (60 mg/day among nonsmokers and 100 mg/day among smokers) may have a protective effect (20). In the Schwartz and Weiss (85) and Britton et al. (87) studies, an increase of 40 mg/day in vitamin C intake led to an approximate 20-ml increase in FEV1. Daily mean vitamin C intakes in these studies were 66 mg and 99.2 mg, respectively, and the highest intake level (178 mg/day) was approximately three times the Recommended Dietary Allowance. Although the amplitude of the effect was modest, if these effects accumulate over 20-30 years, they could have a meaningful impact on the rate at which pulmonary function declines, particularly in symptomatic subjects (85). Longitudinal data support the hypothesis that fresh fruit consumption has a beneficial impact on the lung (95). Among children, consumption of fresh fruit, particularly fruit high in vitamin C, has been related to a lower prevalence of asthma symptoms and higher lung function (64). This effect was observed event at low levels of fruit consumption (one or two servings per week vs. less than one serving per week), which suggests that a small increase in dietary intake could have a beneficial effect. Consumption of fish has also been related to lower airway hyperreactivity among children (75) and higher lung function in adults (100); however, longitudinal data do not provide evidence that increased omega-3 fatty acid intake protects against lung disease (101). Experimental studies of persons with asthma suggest that magnesium infusion may have a place in the acute treatment of asthma, but it does not seem to have long-term benefits. The studies of sodium, selenium, and fish oils do not show convincing evidence of clinical benefits. Studies of vitamin C supplementation suggest a short-term protective effect on airway responsiveness and pulmonary function. It remains to be proven whether consistent use of vitamin C would have a protective effect on the evolution of chronic asthma. Results from supplementation studies conducted among subjects exposed to high levels of oxidants (57-60) suggest that daily intake of antioxidant vitamins exceeding the Recommended Dietary Allowance may have a beneficial effect on lung airways and that intake higher than the Recommended Dietary Allowance should be recommended for populations chronically exposed to photooxidant air pollutants (such as ozone), cigarette smoking, or vigorous exercise. It is difficult to determine the amounts of antioxidant vitamins that people should consume. In particular, although vitamin C was shown to have maximum bioavailability when given in a single dose of 200 mg (102), experiments on which this finding was based were conducted under normal conditions. Guidelines from the US National Cancer Institute (103) recommend consumption of five servings of fruit and vegetables daily, corresponding to a vitamin C intake exceeding 200 mg. Dietary surveys carried out in the US population indicate that less than 12 percent of US children and adults meet this recommended level of intake (104). Diet appears to be an important cofactor in the development of obstructive lung disease, although data are still sparse. There is a need for further research in experimental and epidemiologic settings to better understand the physiologic effects of antioxidant vitamins, omega-3 fatty acids, and other nutrients on lung tissues. The impact of diet on the incidence and evolution of asthma and COPD should be investigated using a cohort design that accounts for known risk factors. This will allow researchers to evaluate the exposure-disease relation over an adequate time frame and obtain insight into the causality of the relation. Some of these studies should enroll infants and young children to determine the impact of early diet on respiratory health. Research should also focus on the equally challenging policy issues--namely, finding effective methods of convincing people to increase their daily consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, to stop smoking cigarettes, and to minimize their environmental and occupational exposure to pollutants and other agents that cause respiratory disease.

The 8,634 children with asthma had a mean age of 5.7 years. Ninety-two percent made at least one asthma office visit, and 13 percent were hospitalized. The urban and rural patterns of care for childhood asthma varied in some potentially important ways. Urban children were twice as likely as rural children to see an asthma specialist (5 percent vs. 2.5 percent, P < 0.05), 2.7 times as likely to receive asthma care in an emergency department (19 percent vs. 7 percent, P < 0.01) and 1.4 times as likely to receive oral steroids (16 percent vs. 12 percent, P = 0.04). If given inhaled anti-inflammatory medication, rural children were more likely to receive inhaled steroids while urban children were more likely to receive cromoglycates.

AB  - Childhood asthma has reached near-epidemic levels in the US cities. Innovative strategies to identify children with asthma and prevent asthma morbidity are needed. This study measured asthma outcomes after initiation of an inner-city elementary school health center with a schoolwide focus on asthma detection and treatment. The site was an inner-city elementary school in Minneapolis, Minn. The study design incorporated a pre and post comparison with a longitudinal cohort of children (n = 67) and a cross-sectional cohort of children before (n = 156) and after (n = 114) the intervention. Hospitalization rates for asthma decreased 75% to 80% over the study period. Outpatient visits for care in the absence of asthma symptoms doubled (p < .01), and the percentage of students seeing a specialist for asthma increased (p < .01). Use of peak flow meters, use of asthma care plans, and use of inhalers also improved (p < .01). While no change occurred in school absenteeism, parents reported that their children had less awakening with asthma and that asthma was less disruptive to family plans. This schoolwide intervention that included identification of children with asthma, education, family support, and clinical care using an elementary school health center was effective in improving asthma outcomes for children.

AB  - In 1996, the members of the St. Columba Collaboration conducted a grassroots neighborhood assessment of a Hispanic area in Newark, New Jersey. This assessment was undertaken during an era of significant political and policy change in New Jersey. As a community-driven and implemented effort, the processes, methods, and outcomes of this assessment provide lessons on community activism, political awareness, and strategic planning. Quantitative surveys were distributed to local residents as well as users of the various services provided through Collaboration programs. Ten qualitative focus groups were held among various Collaboration groups. A total of 471 surveys were returned from a door-to-door distribution and 295 surveys were returned from users of Collaboration programs.Findings from both the quantitative and qualitative components were surprisingly similar. It was striking to note that youth violence, domestic violence, crime, and lack of job skills surpassed poor housing and chronic health problems, including HIV/AIDS and drug and alcohol addiction, as the most noted neighborhood problems. Overwhelmingly, social, welfare, and environmental issues were identified as priority items in a neighborhood marked by extreme poverty, poor childhood immunization rates, high HIV/AIDS rates, and high incidence of childhood asthma. Focus group findings revealed that stressful daily life events and circumstances far overshadowed health and wellness concerns.Recommendations emanating from the St. Columba Neighborhood needs assessment included: (a) establishment of principled partnerships between the Collaboration and other regional entities to extend capacity to design and implement solutions (e.g., partnerships with other higher education institutions, health care agencies); (b) development of strategic planning processes and procedures within the Collaboration; (c) establishment of collaborative partnerships with other Hispanic community-based organizations for political activism; and (d) reorganization of the Collaboration's internal structure and functions to capitalize on opportunities for change.Significant outcomes from this process, in evidence 4 years after the 1996 neighborhood assessment, include: (a) a successful grant application to study violence against Hispanic women, (b) a research program investigating the nature and extent of clinical depression among Hispanic women, (c) establishment of a teenage pregnancy program, (d) English classes for Hispanic women seeking language skills and eventual employment, and (e) partnership extended to the New Jersey Institute of Technology.

AB  - A rise in the prevalence of childhood asthma has been reported in both the UK and in several overseas countries during recent years. Wide geographical variations have also been demonstrated in the distribution of hay fever, atopic eczema and other allergic symptoms. It is the impression of many parents and some clinicians that allergic symptoms may be even higher amongst children in an island environment compared with a similar population on the mainland. To test this hypothesis, Guernsey and Jersey in the Channel Islands, and the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea participated as an independent arm in the International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood (ISAAC). This entailed self-completion of a 38-part pretested and validated questionnaire in a classroom setting under standardised conditions. A total of 3,772 secondary students in school years eight and nine living in the three islands were compared with 27,507 students of similar age in 93 British secondary schools enrolled in the larger UK study. There are a number of demonstrable differences in climate, home environment and lifestyle factors between the islands and mainland UK. Although results were generally above the UK mean, they were comparable with the reference region of South West England and invariably below the UK maximum. For instance, the prevalence of 'ever wheezed?', 'wheezed in last twelve months?', 'wheezed with exercise?' and 'diagnosis of asthma' were a mean of 50.5%, 34.5%, 31% and 19.7% in the islands compared with a UK prevalence of 48.8%, 33.3%, 28.5% and 20.7%, whilst the prevalence of 'runny nose ever?' and 'runny nose in last twelve months?' was a mean of 46.6% and 36.7% in the islands, compared with 47.1% and 37.9% in the UK mean. These differences were not statistically significant. This information will be reassuring to parents of island children, and also demonstrates that services for the management of asthma and other allergic conditions should not be a higher public health priority in these locations than on the mainland of Britain.

AB  - With the rapid pace of urbanization occurring in South Africa many children from rural areas are moving to the cities. Their lifestyles often change dramatically and many end up living in poor overcrowded shacks in squatter communities. These areas often lack the basic amenities of urban life such as clean water, sanitation, and electricity.The prevalence of childhood asthma is on the increase in South Africa. Unique problems are encountered in the diagnosis and management of asthma here. Innovative approaches leading to the introduction of appropriate methods and technology have been developed. These measures may be applicable to other developing countries.

AB  - Background: In a prospective birth-cohort study, we assessed the relevance of mite and cat allergen exposure for the development of childhood asthma up to age 7 years.Methods: Of 1314 newborn infants enrolled in five German cities in 1990, follow-up data at age 7 years were available for 939 children. Assessments included repeated measurement of specific IgE to food and inhalant allergens, measurement of indoor allergen exposure at 6 months, 18 months, and 3 years of age, and yearly interviews by a paediatrician. At age 7 years, pulmonary function was tested and bronchial hyper-responsiveness was measured in 645 children.Findings: At age 7, the prevalence of wheezing in the past 12 months was 10.0% (94 of 938), and 6.1% (57 of 939) parents reported a doctor's diagnosis of asthma in their children. Sensitisation to indoor allergens was associated with asthma, wheeze, and increased bronchial responsiveness. However, no relation between early indoor allergen exposure and the prevalence of asthma, wheeze, and bronchial hyper-responsiveness was seen.Interpretation: Our data do not support the hypothesis that exposure to environmental allergens causes asthma in childhood, but rather that the induction of specific IgE responses and the development of childhood asthma are determined by independent factors.

AB  - The relationship between increased airway responsiveness and asthma severity in children is unclear. The Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) with 1,041 children with mild to moderate asthma offers an opportunity to relate the concentration of methacholine that causes a 20% fall in FEV(1) (PC(20)) to level of lung function, occurrence of respiratory symptoms, duration of disease, and assessment of severity by clinical staff. Decreasing PC(20) was found to be associated with lower levels of lung function (prebronchodilator percent predicted FEV(1): r = 0.29, beta = 3.5, p < 0.001), the occurrence of chronic asthma symptoms, persistent wheezing (odds ratio [OR] = 1.66, p < 0.001), subjective clinical staff assessment of asthma severity (p < 0.001), and longer duration of asthma (r = -0.11, beta = -0.20, p < 0.002). These data provide evidence that the degree of airway responsiveness is linked to disease severity in children with mild to moderate asthma.

AB  - In 1998, as a result of a collaborative effort. the open airways for schools (OAS) program was implemented in New York state. The program included 40 schools from 8 school districts throughout the state. The purpose of the OAS program was to assist children in managing symptoms and feelings about asthma and help parents to effectively manage their child's asthma. The OAS program consisted of six sessions for the children and two sessions for the parents. This project demonstrated that the OAS program significantly affected both the parents' and the children's asthma symptom management behaviors. Copyright © 2000 by Aspen Publishers, Inc.

AB  - This study examined the potential mediating/moderating influence of both illness intrusiveness and asthma severity on the association between illness uncertainty and depression in a college sample of older adolescents and young adults (N = 40) with histories of childhood asthma. There was a significant association between increased illness uncertainty and increased levels of depression. However, analyses indicated that neither illness intrusiveness nor asthma severity served as mediators in the uncertainty-depression relationship. Examination of moderator effects of intrusiveness and severity on the uncertainty-depression relationship revealed an interaction for severity only; thus, the significant effect of uncertainty on depression was at its maximim under conditions of increased illness severity. Results suggest that cognitive appraisal mechanisms involving decreasing ambiguity about illness may be worthwhile targets for intervention.

AB  - Asthma is common in children and its prevalence in this age group is increasing. While the reasons for this reported increase, and indeed the true magnitude of the increase, remain unclear, there can be no doubt that asthma is now a major health problem in children worldwide. Fortunately, our knowledge of the pathophysiology of asthma is also increasing. It is now known that asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease regulated by a variety of mediators, of which perhaps the leukotrienes are among the most important. This new understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease has spurred the development of the antileukotriene agents, which can be expected to play an increasingly important role in the management of childhood asthma.

AB  - Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are an established treatment for asthma in childhood. Recent data bring to light growing concerns that ICS may have significant effects on growth velocity in children. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently convened a joint meeting to review these data, and to release new class labelling for ICS that notes this potential adverse effect. Additional concerns regarding ICS are also discussed, including other potential adverse effects, difficulty of use, noncompliance, and patient and parental concerns with the safety of ICS. The aim of this article is as follows: to describe the rationale for the use of ICS in children with asthma; to delineate the association of ICS with potential growth suppression in children; to discuss recent FDA class labelling for use of ICS in children; to describe other potential long term effects of ICS in children; and to detail compliance issues in children with asthma treated with ICS.

AB  - During the last 30 years, a significant rise in wheezing illness has occurred in the child population. Despite its high prevalence there is no clear definition of the disease, which includes a heterogeneous group of syndromes ranging from transient wheezing in infancy to atopic asthma with persistence into adult life. Molecular advances and further epidemiological information from well characterised individuals and their families are likely to clarify the different subtypes of wheezing illness and inform therapeutic options. With the recognition that chronic airway inflammation is a feature of persistent disease, at least in adults, there has been a trend towards the early introduction of anti-inflammatory treatment and particularly inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). However, the natural resolution of much wheezing illness, particularly in young children and in children with viral-induced episodes, suggests that newly presenting children should remain on symptomatic therapy alone while the severity of the disease is being assessed. Although ICS have become a cornerstone of management of chronic persistent disease, their ability to protect against exacerbations in young and mildly affected children is questionable. Alongside concerns about long term use of ICS and possible systemic adverse effects, there remains a need for alternative approaches to the control of the disease in children. Extrapolation of the findings of large multicentre adult studies into childhood, particularly for doubling the doses of ICS and long-acting [beta]-agonists, may be unsound. Other approaches include the early introduction of inhaled cromones, use of second generation antihistamines, low dose theophyllines and, more recently, leukotriene modifiers. As the majority of preschool children will become asymptomatic by mid-childhood, there is an urgent need to identify those in whom chronic airway inflammation is developing, as it is in this group that early introduction of ICS may be of maximum benefit. In the remainder, other approaches, including use of corticosteroid-sparing long-acting [beta]-agonists and leukotriene modifying drugs, may be more appropriate. Safe and effective oral preparations such as leukotriene modifying drugs are likely to establish a significant role in the management of symptoms in children of all ages and with all types of asthma and wheezing illness.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this article is to review data on the efficacy and safety of montelukast in the treatment of children with asthma. Methodology: Available published literature, including published abstracts, is reviewed. Results: In patients aged 6 to 14 years with asthma (n = 27), montelukast 5mg demonstrated a significant decrease in exercise-induced bronchoconstriction 20 to 24 hours postdose after 2 days of treatment. For children with chronic asthma, only one study of the regular use of a leukotriene receptor antagonist has been published. The efficacy and safety of montelukast in children aged 6 to 14 years with asthma (n = 336) were studied during an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. There was a significantly greater improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV) from baseline for the montelukast group (8.23%) compared with the placebo group (3.58%). There was a significant decrease in the use of a [beta]-agonist for symptom relief, as well as in the percentage of days and percentage of patients with asthma exacerbations. An asthma specific quality-of-life (QOL) questionnaire revealed a significant overall improvement in QOL and a significant improvement in the QOL domains for symptoms, activity and emotions in montelukast recipients. There was no significant difference between montelukast and placebo recipients in the frequency of adverse events, with the exception of allergic rhinitis, which was more prevalent in the placebo group. An open label follow-up of patients from the above study was undertaken. The effect of montelukast on FEV was consistent for up to 1.4 years, with the increase in FEV being not significantly different from that in a small control group treated with inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate. QOL remained significantly improved during the open treatment period. Conclusions: Montelukast appears effective and safe for the treatment of children with asthma.

AB  - Background: Asthma morbidity and mortality are higher in the United States for African-American (AA) children when compared to European-American (EA) children.Study Objectives: To explore racial differences in physiologic factors associated with pediatric asthma severity.Design: Cross-sectional.Methods: We analyzed data from two groups of children in suburban Detroit, one of which contains non-urban, middle-class AA children, a group not usually included in childhood asthma studies. All children were 6 to 8 years of age. Clinical evaluations included medical history, physical examination, skin testing, spirometry, and methacholine challenge.Results: The study population (n = 569) was 14% African American, 51% of the participants were male, and the mean age was 6.8 +/- 0.4 years. Socioeconomic status (parental education) was similar overall by race, although some strata-specific differences were observed. The prevalence of physician-diagnosed asthma was 10% for both AA and EA groups. AA children were more reactive to methacholine than EA children (42% vs 22%, respectively; p = 0.001), and had significantly higher total IgE than EA children (geometric mean, 60. 6 vs 27.5 IU/mL; p = 0.001). Serum IgE was related to methacholine reactivity in EA children (p = 0.001), but not AA children (p = 0. 73). These differences remained after adjustment for gender, age, parental education, parental smoking, and maternal smoking during pregnancy.Conclusions: Our data support previous reports of racial differences in lung volume, airway responsiveness, and serum IgE concentrations. We found a racial difference in the relationship between total serum IgE and airway responsiveness that is unreported elsewhere. Overall, our results suggest that AA children may be predisposed to asthma.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Asthma is the most common chronic illness among US children and is most prevalent in low-income and minority groups. We used multivariate models to disentangle the effects of race/ethnicity, income, and other individual-level risk factors on asthma in a population-based sample of children aged 3 years. METHODS: Data are from the 1988 National Maternal and Infant Health Survey and 1991 Longitudinal Follow-Up. Odds ratios of asthma prevalence, hospitalization, and emergency room use were estimated, with control for socioeconomic characteristics, health behaviors, and insurance. RESULTS: Asthma prevalence, hospitalization, and emergency room use declined with increasing income for non-Black but not Black children. CONCLUSIONS: Lifetime income and sociodemographic characteristics do not explain the excess risks of asthma and emergency health care use for asthma among young Black children.

AB  - The primary aim was to determine whether there was an inverse association between the duration of exclusive breastfeeding and the development of traits associated with asthma in children at age six years. A prospective cohort study of children from Western Australia was enrolled prior to birth and followed to age six. Two thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine children were recruited through antenatal clinics at the major tertiary obstetric hospital in Perth. Unconditional logistic regression was used to model the association between duration of exclusive breastfeeding and outcomes related to asthma or atopy at age six allowing for a number of important confounders. These included gender, gestational age, smoking in pregnancy and early child care. After adjustment for confounders, the introduction of milk other than breastmilk before four months of age was a significant (p<0.05) risk factor for all asthma-related outcomes in six-year-old children: (i) doctor diagnosed asthma odds ratio{OR}=1.25 (95% CI 1.02-1.54); (ii) wheeze three or more times since the age of one year OR 1.42 (1.15-1.76); (iii) wheeze in the last twelve months OR 1.28 (1.02-1.76); (iv) sleep disturbance due to wheeze within the last twelve months OR 1.41 (1.04-1.90); (v) age at doctor diagnosis (hazard ratio{HR}1.22 {1.03-1.43}); (vi) age at first wheeze (HR 1.36 {1.17-1.59}) and; (vii) positive reaction to common aeroallergens OR 1.27 (1.01-1.59). There is a substantial reduction in risk of childhood asthma as assessed at age six years, if exclusive breastfeeding is continued for at least the first four months of life. These findings are important for our understanding of the aetiology of and for the potential prevention of asthma in children.

AB  - Childhood asthma is a major public health problem. It is the leading cause of childhood hospitalizations and school absences despite recent advances in management. Current standards of care call for client education as partners in disease management. In pediatrics, this calls for shared decision making between health care provider, parent, and child. Traditional care delivery systems often fall short of meeting this standard. This article describes a nurse practitioner-run school-based asthma clinic, designed as a pilot study, to fill these gaps. Characteristics of the community that affected outcomes are described. Copyright (c) 2000 by W B. Saunders Company

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine what factors primary care pediatricians believe are important in establishing the initial diagnosis of childhood asthma and to identify variations in physicians' beliefs concerning this clinical decision. STUDY DESIGN: Massachusetts American Academy of Pediatrics Fellows were surveyed about their beliefs concerning the importance of 20 clinical factors associated with establishing the initial diagnosis of asthma. RESULTS: Most clinicians considered recurrent wheeze (96%), symptomatic improvement with a bronchodilator (90%), recurrent cough (89%), exclusion of alternative diagnoses (87%), and suggestive peak flow findings (82%) as important in diagnosing asthma. However, there was substantial heterogeneity among clinicians as to which combinations of factors they each considered relevant; for example, only 60% identified all 5 of the above factors to be necessary or important. Further, <50% identified presence of any of the 20 factors as necessary. Although national guidelines cite objective assessment of pulmonary function as essential, spirometry and peak expiratory flow testing were identified as necessary by only 8% and 10%, respectively. Two factors believed to contribute to establishing the asthma diagnosis contradicted the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines and expert opinion (age >2 years and absence of fever during episodes) and these beliefs were more likely held by those clinicians in practice for >5 years. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of pediatricians believe several common clinical factors establish a diagnosis of childhood asthma, but disagree over what combinations of these factors are important. Some misconceptions persist despite wide dissemination of clinical practice guidelines. We believe that future asthma guidelines will need to organize diagnostic criteria in an easily understood format, like a decision tree, to facilitate early recognition of asthma in young children.

AB  - OBJECTIVE. Childhood asthma morbidity and mortality are increasing despite improvements in asthma therapy. We hypothesized that a substantial number of children with moderate to severe asthma are not taking the maintenance medications recommended by national guidelines. The objective of this study was to describe medication use among US children with asthma and determine risk factors for inadequate therapy. METHODS. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III 1988-1994 provided cross-sectional, parent-reported data for children 2 months to 16 years of age. Analysis focused on children with moderate to severe asthma (defined as having any hospitalization for wheezing, >/=2 acute visits for wheezing, or >/=3 episodes of wheezing over the past year). We defined these children as adequately treated if they had taken a maintenance medication (inhaled corticosteroid, cromolyn, or theophylline) during the past month. Demographic variables were analyzed for independent associations with inadequacy of therapy. The statistical analysis used SUDAAN software to account for the complex sampling design. RESULTS. A total of 1025 children (9.4%) had physician-diagnosed asthma. Of those with moderate to severe asthma (n = 524), only 26% had taken a maintenance medication during the past month. Even among children with 2 or more hospitalizations over the previous year, only 32% had taken maintenance medications. In a logistic regression analysis, factors significantly associated with inadequate therapy included: age </=5 years, Medicaid insurance, and Spanish language. Children surveyed after 1991, when national guidelines for asthma management became available, were no more likely to have taken maintenance medications than children surveyed before 1991. CONCLUSION. Most children with moderate to severe asthma in this nationally representative sample, including those with multiple hospitalizations, did not receive adequate asthma therapy. These children may incur avoidable morbidity. Young children, poor children, and children from Spanish-speaking families appear to be at particularly high risk for inadequate therapy.

AB  - Inhaled steroids play a central role in the management of childhood asthma. There is concern about their side effects, especially on growth. However asthma may also cause growth retardation. Growth rates are not stable, so randomised controlled parallel group studies are needed to assess the impact of inhaled steroids on growth. This review is confine to one inhaled steroid, beclomethasone, that is known to have significant levels of systemic absorption. To determine whether inhaled beclomethasone cause significant delay in the linear growth of children with asthma. The Cochrane Airways Group asthma register was searched. Bibliographies from included studies, and known reviews were searched for additional citations. Personal contact with colleagues and researchers working in the field of asthma were made to identify potentially relevant trials. Randomized, controlled trials comparing the effects of beclamethasone to non-steroidal medication (placebo or non-steroidal therapy) on the linear growth of children with asthma. Data related to the clinical outcome 'change in growth' were extracted by two reviewers working independently One hundred and fifty-nine citations were identified by the search strategy and bibliography review. Three studies met the inclusion criteria. All used beclomethasone 200 mcg twice daily delivered by dry powder Diskhaler to treat children with mild-moderate asthma. Study duration was 7-12 months. In all three studies, a significant decrease in linear growth occurred in children treated with beclomethasone compared to those receiving placebo or non-steroidal asthma therapy. The average decrease, calculated through meta-analysis, was -1.54 cm per year (95% CI -1.15, -1.94). In children with mild-moderate asthma, beclomethasone 200 mcg twice daily caused a decrease in linear growth of -1.54 cm per year. These studies lasted a maximum of 54 weeks, so it remains unclear whether the decrease in growth is sustained or whether it reverses with 'catch up' after therapy is discontinued. We are unable to comment on growth effects of other inhaled steroids that have potentially less systemic effects. If inhaled steroids are required to control a child's asthma, we recommend using the minimum dose that effectively controls the child's asthma and closely following growth.[CINAHL Note: The Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews contain interactive software that allows various calculations in the MetaView.]

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bronchiolitis in infancy is viewed as a risk factor for childhood asthma, but factors predicting which infants will have persistent wheezing have not been identified. In addition, the nature of the association between the 2 conditions is uncertain. We wished to determine whether eosinophil counts at the time of acute bronchiolitis predicted the presence of wheezing in later childhood. METHODS: We retrospectively identified infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis, determined peripheral blood eosinophil counts at the time of bronchiolitis, and then contacted their families when they had reached 7 years of age. RESULTS: Eosinophil counts at the time of bronchiolitis were greater in subjects who would have wheezing at 7 years of age (median: 98 cells/mm(3)) than in infants who would have no recurrent wheezing (median: 0 cells/mm(3)) or transient wheezing only up to 3 years of age (median: 0 cells/mm(3)). When the effects of family history of asthma, gender, and passive exposure to cigarette smoke were examined, only eosinophilia at the time of bronchiolitis demonstrated a statistically significant relationship to the presence of wheezing at 7 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Eosinophilia at the time of bronchiolitis generally predicts the development of wheezing persisting into later childhood. Therefore, the association of bronchiolitis and childhood asthma seems more likely to be attributable to an immunologic anomaly that precedes the development of, or is induced by, bronchiolitis rather than to structural damage to the airway as a result of bronchiolitis.

AB  - Current guidelines on the management of childhood asthma have emphasised the important preventive role of inhaled corticosteroids, which should be used at the lowest possible doses that are compatible with good disease control. However, some children do not respond to inhaled corticosteroids, the most common reasons for which are inability to use conventional hand-held inhalers (plus spacers and face masks) effectively or lack of cooperation with them, particularly among infants and young children. In these patients, nebulisers have proved effective in administering corticosteroids, and this form of delivery is often preferred by both the children and their parents, despite their longer administration times (commonly around 10 minutes). Compliance with these devices may therefore be better than with a conventional pressurised metered-dose inhaler plus spacer and face mask. Recent studies with nebulised budesonide have demonstrated that once-daily administration is as effective in maintaining control of asthma symptoms in children as the usual twice-daily administration. In children with moderately severe persistent asthma, the improvement provided by once-daily nebulised doses of 1.0mg budesonide has been found to be equivalent to that with twice-daily doses of 0.25 or 0.5mg, indicating that once-daily therapy is an effective option that can be considered in many patients. In view of the time-consuming nature of nebuliser administration, reduction of the frequency of corticosteroid administration from twice to once daily may be useful in simplifying the treatment programme and improving compliance with it. This may be beneficial in reducing under-utilisation of inhaled corticosteroids in children with asthma and improving long term control of the disease.

AB  - Babies born in the delivery rooms of hospitals are exposed to latex through skin and mucous membrane contact with prepowdered latex gloves worn by midwives and doctors, and through the inhalation of latex bound starch powder in the air of the delivery room. This paper examines the hypothesis that babies are at risk of latex sensitization, and that part of the sharp increase in childhood asthma, eczema and anaphylaxis in the past thirty to forty years may be linked to this. These possibilities seem hitherto unsuspected. In over seven hundred papers on latex allergy no mention of neo-natal exposure to latex has been found. Even obstetric papers discussing the risks for an atopic mother do not seem to anticipate any risk for the baby, who might also be atopic. Latex allergy is primarily regarded as an occupational hazard. This paper suggests that it is a hazard for every baby handled by latex gloves at birth.

AB  - Objective: To describe the rates of exacerbation of existing asthma and incidence of new disease in Israeli men during military service.Design: All 17-year-old Israeli nationals are obliged by law to appear at the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) recruiting office for medical examination. The medical history of army recruits was noted during the 30-month period after their induction into the IDF, and medical examinations were performed by pulmonary specialists in all suspected cases of asthma. The duty status of the soldiers in combat units (CUs), maintenance units (MUs), and clerical tasks was related to their asthma status.Results: Of a total of 59,058 recruits, 1.0% developed asthma during the 30 months of this study; of those in CUs, 1.2% developed asthma; of those in MUs, 0.8% developed asthma; and of those performing clerical tasks, 0.6% developed asthma. The relative risk for developing or worsening of asthma was related to both the preexisting asthma status of the recruit and the environment in which he carried out his military service. The annual incidence of occupational-related asthma in MUs was found to be 800/million: five to six times the rates reported elsewhere.Conclusions: Service in CUs was associated with an increased frequency of exacerbation of asthma among recruits with previous disease and with the appearance of disease de novo. "Normal" conscripts with a history of childhood asthma are at a higher risk of developing overt asthma when compared to subjects with no such history. We found a 25% relative excess of incident cases of asthma in soldiers posted in MUs compared to those performing clerical tasks [(0.8 to 0.6%)/0.8%]. This difference is probably attributed to the difference in occupational hazards in these categories. Further studies are needed to determine if this represents the elicitation of underlying preexisting airway lability by new work demands or other environmental conditions, or if this represents a new development of airway lability because of specific immune or nonimmune factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthma morbidity and mortality has increased substantially in recent years, but asthma hospitalization rates among many geographic and sociodemographic groups have remained stable. Observations on asthma hospitalization rates and severity of acute episodes might provide valuable insight into the functioning of the health care system during this period of health care reform. OBJECTIVE: To analyze changes between 1991 and 1995 in childhood asthma hospitalization rates and severity of acute episodes. DESIGN AND METHODS: All 29 329 hospitalizations, including 2028 for asthma, for the 198 893 children (<19 years of age) in Monroe County (Rochester), New York, were studied during this 5-year period. Severity was determined by hospital record review on a 22% random sample. Using the worst oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) during the first 24 hours of hospitalization as the primary index of severity, episodes were categorized as mild (0 to >/=95), moderate (90 to 94), or severe (<90). RESULTS: Hospitalization rates are expressed as hospitalizations per 1000 child-years. The overall asthma hospitalization rate was 2.04 (95% confidence interval, 1.95-2.13). The overall annual asthma hospitalization rate remained relatively stable from 1991 (1.90) to 1995 (2.31), whereas the hospitalization rates for severe asthma rose 270%-from 0.57 to 1.55-during this period. Simultaneously, the hospitalization rates for mild asthma decreased from 0.26 to 0.12. As a proportion of all asthma hospitalizations between 1991 and 1995, severe episodes increased from 31.5% to 60.4%; conversely, mild episodes decreased from 14.1% to 4.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Severity increased significantly among children hospitalized for asthma while the overall asthma hospitalization rate remained stable. It seems that the health care system in this community has responded to an increase in severity of asthma by raising the severity threshold for admission.

AB  - This article provides an overview of asthma in children. Wheezing illness is common in infants, however, not all will have asthma. Cough is a common symptom but evidence of airway lability should be present to confirm diagnosis. Diagnostic tests are not possible in children under 5 or 6 years of age and treatment relies on a clear clinical history and a trial of medication. Early treatment in children over the age of 3 years with inhaled steroids is advocated when symptoms are not controlled by bronchodilator treatment alone. The British Guidelines on Asthma Management (1997) provide a framework for a consistent approach to asthma management in both primary and secondary care. Caution should be exercised with high doses of inhaled steroids and all children should be monitored closely until growth is complete. It is also important to recognize the differing needs of teenagers as asthma management in this age group may raise specific issues for health professionals. Community nurses including school nurses and health visitors may with appropriate training increase and develop their involvement in the management of childhood asthma.

AB  - Background: Discharge planning is becoming an important part of the management of childhood asthma in hospital. Readmission to hospital, although often inevitable, might represent a failure of the opportunity for intervention presented by a brief period of supervised care in hospital.Aim: To examine the impact of a structured, nurse-led discharge package for children admitted to hospital with acute asthma on readmission to hospital, reattendance at the accident and emergency (A&E) department, and general practitioner consultations for asthma.Methods: A structured nurse-led discharge package, consisting of a 20 minute patient education programme and self management plan for children with asthma was developed on the wards of a busy children's hospital. A randomised controlled trial was conducted involving 160 children aged 2-16 years admitted for asthma over a 12 month period. Readmission and A&E reattendance's over the six months after discharge from hospital were obtained from the hospital computerised information system and general practitioner consultations from practice records.Results: Children in the intervention group were significantly less likely to be readmitted to hospital in the next six months than those in the control group (12 of 80 v 30 of 80 patients), and significantly less likely to attend the A&E department (6 of 80 v 31 of 80). Significantly fewer children in the intervention group had visits to their general practitioner for problematic asthma (31 of 78 v 72 of 77 for whom data were available).Conclusion: By delivering the simplest form of education and support during a child's stay in hospital, readmissions over a six month period were reduced. The programme was designed to be suitable for administration by nursing staff on the children's wards after a brief period of training.

AB  - This article tests a model of self-regulatory development in which families' cognitive beliefs and behavioral skills for managing asthma symptoms emerge in four successive phases: asthma symptom avoidance, asthma acceptance, asthma compliance, and asthma self-regulation. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed that the hypothesized multiphase model provided the best factorial fit for phase items. Subsequent Guttman analyses of the families' phase scores revealed a high degree of sequential ordering. Finally, trend analyses of family phase differences revealed a significant negative linear relation with measures of asthma severity and a significant positive linear relation with physician care and concern measures, asthma regulatory measures, and beliefs in Western biomedical practices. Despite receiving primary care for asthma at a major metropolitan university hospital, 83% of the sample were classified as precompliant. The phase model of asthma self-regulatory development offers a qualitative approach for investigating the psychological determinants of asthma self-regulatory behavior.

AB  - Although often regarded as a disease of childhood, asthma is common in elderly people. Although recent figures show a decline over the past few years in the number of asthma deaths in children and younger adults, the same is not true of older adults, in whom most asthma deaths occur. Differences between asthma in young and old patients are seen not only in response to treatment. The nonspecific presentation of asthma in elderly adults means that the diagnosis of asthma is difficult to make. In addition, research suggests that physicians are reluctant to use spirometry and measurement of reversibility when investigating respiratory symptoms in old people. This leads to a tendency to label breathless or wheezy elderly patients as having chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) rather than asthma. In turn, patients with a diagnosis of COPD are less likely to be treated with bronchodilators and corticosteroids. Treatment guidelines for the management of asthma in children and younger adults may need to be adapted when applied to older patients. Reduced perception of bronchoconstriction may lead to underuse of bronchodilators prescribed 'as required'. The bronchodilator response to [beta]-agonists is attenuated as part of the normal aging process, and other groups of bronchodilator medications should be considered. Inhaler technique can be a particular problem in elderly patients with asthma, requiring careful choice of inhaler device. However, the frequent presence of multiple pathology and multiple medication in this age group enhances the risk of adverse effects from oral preparations, and so the inhaled route should be preferred wherever possible. Underestimation of the severity of an acute exacerbation of asthma by both patient and doctor has been suggested as a contributory factor to poor outcome in older people. Since the cardiovascular responses to hypoxia and bronchoconstriction tend to diminish with increasing age, objective measures of asthma severity (peak flow monitoring and blood gas estimation) are essential in this age group.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inaccuracies in symptom perception may contribute to morbidity and mortality in childhood asthma. OBJECTIVE: To systematically examine the accuracy of symptom perception on the part of children with asthma and their parents, as well as their interpretation and evaluation of the symptoms. METHOD: Twenty-eight patient/parent pairs from suburban and underserved urban pediatric populations participated in a 5-week protocol tracking subjective assessments of asthma severity (visual analog scales) and peak expiratory flow rates. Relationships between perceptual accuracy and demographic and disease factors were investigated. RESULTS: Adolescents were more accurate than school-aged children, more accurate children had better morbidity outcomes, and African American parents were more accurate than Caucasian parents. Socioeconomic status did not affect accuracy. Both children and parents missed early symptoms and waited too long prior to intervening in an exacerbation. CONCLUSIONS: There are multiple opportunities for error in symptom perception and evaluation. Identification of the source of error is critical to the effective utilization of education on self-management.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined the effects of outdoor air pollutants on daily hospital admissions in Sydney, Australia. METHODS: A time-series analysis of counts of daily hospital admissions and outdoor air pollutants (1990 to 1994) was performed, by means of Poisson regression that allowed for overdispersion and autocorrelation. RESULTS: An increase in daily maximum 1-hour concentration of nitrogen dioxide from the 10th to the 90th percentile was associated with an increase of 5.29% (95% confidence interval = 1.07, 9.68) in childhood asthma admissions and 4.60%(-0.17,9.61) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) admissions. A similar increase in daily maximum 1-hour particulate concentration was associated with an increase of 3.01% (-0.38, 6.52) in COPD admissions. An increase from the 10th to the 90th percentile in daily maximum 1-hour nitrogen dioxide, daily maximum 1-hour ozone, and daily mean particulate was associated with an increase in heart disease admissions among those 65 years and older of 6.71% (4.25, 9.23), 2.45% (-0.37, 5.35), and 2.82% (0.90, 4.77), respectively. Heart disease and childhood asthma were primarily associated with nitrogen dioxide; COPD was associated with both nitrogen dioxide and particulates. CONCLUSIONS: Current levels of air pollution in Sydney are associated with increased hospitalization for respiratory and heart disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To design, develop, and distribute asthma education materials relevant to the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP), a National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute sponsored comprehensive clinical trial. This trial is designed to evaluate the relative efficacy of three treatment strategies on asthma control, and lung growth and development in children with asthma. APPROACH: A Patient Education Center (PEC) was established to prepare CAMP-specific asthma educational materials that would promote consistent implementation of the CAMP protocol, adherence to study medications and record keeping requirements and retention in the trial. The PEC has the responsibility to design the asthma education program and to provide support to the study clinical center coordinators/educators who maintain direct and ongoing contact with the participants. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1,041 children with asthma age 5 through 12 years were enrolled in the trial between November 1993 and September 1995 at 8 clinical centers. PROCESS: The three major tenets of self-management were highlighted in the CAMP patient education program: anticipate problems before they arise, determine the appropriate responses, and rehearse and practice behaviors that are effective solutions. CAMP education was standardized across centers to provide consistency in the implementation of the protocol. The program was structured to be comprehensive in order to address the various issues encountered by the participants and their caretakers, including background information on asthma and asthma therapy, instructions on following the study protocol (taking medication and monitoring symptoms and peak flow), and clear steps for handling asthma exacerbations. Materials were prepared in the form of handouts, handbooks, and videos. Instructional manuals were also prepared on the use of these materials for the nurse coordinators at each clinical center. CONCLUSIONS: The CAMP approach to asthma education was planned with the realization that patient education is essential to successful treatment and must be fully integrated into the patient's routine care. The CAMP education materials are readily available in a national repository and could be used for asthma education programs in a practice setting or another clinical research effort.

AB  - Abstact Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways. The worldwide prevalence of asthma has increased in recent decades. There is an approximately 20-fold variation (range 1.6% to 36.8%) in the prevalence of childhood asthma throughout the world. The highest prevalence rates are in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland and Canada. The indirect costs of asthma, which include absence from school, lost productivity and premature death, are substantial. The goals of asthma therapy include controlling the disease and maintaining the well-being of the patient. Identification and avoidance of factors that precipitate asthma attacks are important in achieving satisfactory control of asthma. A stepped-care approach to drug therapy, in which anti-inflammatory therapy is the cornerstone, is recommended. Zafirlukast is a cysteinyl leukotriene type 1 receptor antagonist that causes bronchodilation and has anti-inflammatory properties. Oral zafirlukast 20mg twice daily was more effective than placebo in relieving symptoms, improving lung function, reducing requirements for as-needed [beta]-agonists and preventing exacerbations in patients >=12 years of age with mild to moderate asthma. Zafirlukast 20mg twice daily produced improvements in symptoms and reductions in as-needed [beta]-agonist rescue medication similar to inhaled sodium cromoglycate in patients with asthma. As an alternative to inhaled corticosteroids, zafirlukast 20mg twice daily produced improvements in night-time wakenings, mornings with asthma and reductions in the use of [beta]-agonist rescue medication in patients with mild to moderate asthma. However, beclomethasone dipropionate 200 to 250ug twice daily produced greater improvement than zafirlukast in all efficacy parameters and significantly greater improvements in morning peak expiratory flow rate, forced expiratory volume in 1 second and daytime symptoms than zafirlukast. In patients with asthma uncontrolled on low dosages of inhaled corticosteroids, the addition of oral zafirlukast 40 or 80mg twice daily was as effective as doubling the dose of the inhaled corticosteroid. The most common adverse events associated with zafirlukast in trials <=20 weeks long were pharyngitis, headache and aggravation reactions, the incidence of which was similar to that in placebo recipients. Drug-drug interactions involving zafirlukast and aspirin, erythromycin, terfenadine, theophylline and warfarin have been described. Zafirlukast is indicated for the prophylactic treatment of chronic asthma. The drug is currently recognised in the US guidelines as an alternative to inhaled corticosteroids in patients aged >=12 years with mild persistent asthma. As an adjunct to corticosteroids, the role of zafirlukast is still evolving, but it seems likely that patients with asthma of all severities may benefit from the drug.

AB  - Study Objectives: The objective of this study is to examine the relationship between indoor environmental factors and childhood asthma in a subtropical area.Design: A case-control study was performed using participants of a prevalence survey that included 165 schoolchildren with asthma and 165 age- and gender-matched control subjects.Setting: The study was confined to 4,164 schoolchildren aged 6 to 12 years attending eight primary schools in Kaohsiung County rural municipalities who participated in a prevalence study concerning the health effects of the indoor environment.Participants: Cases (n=165) were defined as children with current asthma confirmed by a physician. Control subjects (n=165) were selected from the same school and class and matched for age and gender, and they did not have a previous diagnosis of asthma, history of physician-confirmed atopic diseases, persistent wheezing, cough, or phlegm, or reported chest illness, pneumonia, or bronchitis.Measurements and Results: Information regarding the home environment was obtained using a structured written questionnaire, completed by the parents of the children. Of the many indoor environmental factors included in this study, only home dampness showed an association with asthma (odds ratio=2.65).Conclusions: We conclude that dampness in the home is a new public health issue in subtropical areas.

AB  - Montelukast is a selective antagonist of the leukotriene D (LTD) receptor. In patients with asthma, montelukast 5 to 250 mg/day attenuated LTD-induced bronchoconstriction and, at a dosage of 10mg, significantly reduced early and late airway response to allergen (dust mite extract) relative to placebo. In studies evaluating the effects of various dosages of montelukast on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction the optimal dose of the drug was found to be 10mg. Montelukast 10 mg/day controlled asthma significantly more effectively than placebo in a 3-month randomised double-blind study. In a 9-month open extension of this trial, during which patients were randomised to treatment with montelukast 10 mg/day or beclomethasone (~=400 ug/day), daytime symptom score and [beta]-agonist use decreased to a similar extent in each group. In a further study, treatment with montelukast 10 mg/day permitted clinically significant tapering of corticosteroid dosage in patients with stable asthma. Montelukast (5 mg/day) has also demonstrated efficacy in childhood asthma. The tolerability profile of montelukast was similar to that of placebo in placebo-controlled clinical trials in adults and children; the most common adverse event was headache.

AB  - Since the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, there has been an increasing need to monitor environmental health trends that may be related to the rapid industrialization of the United States/Mexico border. We studied two counties on the California/Baja California border to obtain baseline data on trends in childhood asthma hospitalizations and two pollutants that aggravate asthma, ozone and particulate matter (less than 10 microns in diameter), from 1983 to 1994. Hospital discharge records of children 14 years and younger were analyzed, and rates by county, race, and sex were age-adjusted to the 1990 California population. Data on five ozone and particulate matter indices obtained from the California Environmental Protection Agency were used. Imperial County had the highest childhood asthma hospitalization rates in California for non-Hispanic whites and African-Americans, and the second highest for Hispanics. San Diego County had rates below the state average. Over the time period examined, rates in Imperial County increased 59%, while those in San Diego County decreased 9%. Maximum ozone levels increased 64% in Imperial County but decreased 46% in San Diego County. Particulate matter levels were four times higher in Imperial than in San Diego County. High rates of childhood asthma hospitalizations in Imperial County may be partially related to high levels of poverty and worsening air quality conditions produced by increased burdens on the local airshed. Asthma prevalence surveys and binational time-series analyses examining asthma-pollutant relationships are needed.

AB  - Asthma, a chronic disease of the respiratory tract, affects approximately five percent of the U.S. population, including almost five million children. Childhood asthma has been identified as the leading cause of school absences. This study was to examined efficacy of a school-based program to prevent exacerbation of asthma symptoms and manage asthma in school children using measured doses of an inhaled anti-inflammatory medication. The sample consisted of 22 African-American children in one inner-city elementary school in Dallas, Texas, ages 5-12 years with confirmed diagnoses of asthma. For three months, each child came to the school clinic two times per day for medication administration and measurement of respiratory peak flow rates. Data were collected for a number of variables including bronchodilator use, school absences, self-report of asthma symptoms, and number of visits to the physician. During the study, mean peak flow rates improved approximately 15%, and bronchodilator use decreased 66%. Improvement also was evident in several other areas.

AB  - Epidemiological studies suggest the prevalence of asthma is increasing, though some remain sceptical as to the magnitude or indeed the presence of an increase. However, despite improved diagnosis and the availability of the potent drugs now available, there remains considerable respiratory morbidity associated with asthma. It is clear from a number of studies that failure to deliver drugs to the lungs when using inhaler devices is a factor contributing to this high level of morbidity. Failure of drug delivery may result from the prescribing of inappropriate devices, failure to use devices appropriately or failure to comply with a treatment regimen. For most of the currently available forms of asthma therapy there are significant advantages to be gained from administering them in aerosol form. The benefits to be derived from administering these drugs as an aerosol include a rapid onset of action for drugs such as [beta]-agonists and a low incidence of systemic effects from drugs such as [beta]-agonists and corticosteroids. Over the past 25 years our understanding of the nature of asthma has changed. Though this has been reflected in the emphasis on inhaled corticosteroid therapy in recent guidelines, it has not been reflected in the range of inhaler devices available. Manufacturers continue to place drugs such as corticosteroids in the same devices as short acting [beta]-agonists even though the requirements for these different drug classes are very different. It is likely that this contributes to sub-optimal therapeutic responses with inhaled corticosteroids. However, the variability associated with current delivery systems is relatively small compared with the variability introduced by poor compliance. There is no work currently available to indicate how the use of cheap disposable devises which do not incorporate any form of positive feedback influence compliance with inhaled steroids. Optimising aerosolised drug delivery in childhood involves consideration of the class of drugs, the particular drug within a class but more importantly, the age and abilities of the child. Devices must be selected to suit a particular child's needs and abilities. Devices utilising tidal breathing are generally used such as spacing chambers or, less commonly these days, nebulisers. A screaming or struggling child, or failure to use a closely fitting mask, reduces drug delivery to the lungs enormously. Failure to respond to inhaled therapy in early childhood may be attributable to failure of drug delivery. Drug delivery in early childhood using current devices remains more an art than a science.

AB  - The prevalence of childhood asthma continues to rise, despite the introduction and implementation of innovative treatment methods. Asthma is now one of the most common childhood diseases. It is widely believed that the causes of asthma are likely to be multifactorial. Education on asthma management remains primarily focused on the parents of asthmatic children. A heightened emphasis on education aimed primarily at the child is imperative if the negative trends in morbidity and mortality of childhood asthma are to be curtailed. This article examines the need to correlate educational content with the cognitive ability of the asthmatic child.

AB  - Spontaneous cough is a symptom with diffuse diagnostic significance for childhood asthma. Information on the interrelations between presence/frequency of cough and other symptoms of asthma are not available to the physician. Tracheal sounds were continuously recorded in the homes of 60 children with and 30 without asthma, at 72 and 24 h, respectively. Presence and frequency of cough and presence of wheeze were scored by trained examiners. Wheeze was used to indicate airway obstruction during hours when peak expiratory flow (PEF) values were not available. PEF and self-reported dyspnea were assessed every 4 h. Results showed that asthmatics coughed significantly more often than control subjects during exacerbations, but not during remission. The highest diagnostic sensitivity percentages of cough were 72% for wheeze and 69% for a reduction in PEF > 20%. However, the diagnostic specificity was poor, 41% for wheeze and 34% for a reduction in PEF > 20%. Cough and dyspnea were independent. Three children did not cough during exacerbations. Persistent, isolated cough was observed in two children. It was concluded that spontaneous cough is modestly predictive of asthmatic exacerbations, but not of a diagnosis of asthma or severity of asthma.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although cromones inhibit immediate bronchial responses to both allergen and nonspecific challenge, their effectiveness in treating nonatopic childhood asthma is unknown. We therefore investigated a possible effect of nedocromil sodium on bronchial hyperreactivity and asthmatic symptoms in a group of children receiving this drug for nonatopic asthma. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of two parallel groups was carried out in our pediatric respiratory disease clinic. Twenty children with mild, nonatopic asthma hyperreactive to fog-induced challenge were treated with inhaled nedocromil sodium 16 mg each day for 6 weeks (group N) or with a placebo (group P). Five girls and five boys (7 to 13 years of age) were randomly assigned to group N, and three girls and seven boys (aged 6 to 16 years) to group P. Symptoms and bronchodilator use were reported on diary cards. Ultrasonic nebulized distilled water PD10 was measured administering increasing doses of nebulized distilled water (2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 L). RESULTS: Symptom scores were significantly affected by the active treatment. Baseline lung function was normal and remained unaltered after treatment with nedocromil sodium. Nonspecific reactivity was significantly reduced over time only in the active treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: Nedocromil sodium can reduce the severity of asthmatic symptoms and nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity at fog-induced challenge in children with stable, nonatopic asthma.

AB  - Five children with severe asthma requiring at least 10 mg of prednisolone daily were treated with cyclosporin. Three were weaned from prednisolone, but one quickly relapsed. One girl had her steroid dose lowered but suffered unacceptable hirsutism and one child failed to respond. Cyclosporin may be useful in refractory childhood asthma. A prospective study is required to confirm this.

AB  - Childhood asthma and allied conditions, eg, bronchiolitis, are one of the most frequent causes of admission to hospital for children. New Zealand also has one of the highest incidences of asthma mortality in the world, although this is now improving. Hospitalisation, whether for the first time, or one of many frequent admissions can be stressful, not only for the child but also for the family. Families often experience a loss of control and parenting when in hospital, as well as having to adapt to the reality of chronic illness. Casey (Glasper & Tucker, 1993) has developed a nursing model based on the principle of negotiated partnership between parents and nurses to care for the child. The model is still evolving, but is now in use in hospitals in U.K. caring for sick children.

AB  - Objective. This paper describes a pilot project to develop and implement a low-cost system for ongoing surveillance of childhood asthma in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin. Methods. The authors organized a planning workshop to solicit information and ideas for an asthma surveillance system, bringing together national experts with Milwaukee professionals and community representatives involved in the prevention and treatment of asthma. Based on recommendations from the workshop, a pilot surveillance project was implemented in Milwaukee County using records of emergency room visits and hospital admissions for asthma abstracted from the computerized billing records of the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin (CHW), retrospectively for 1993 and prospectively for 1994. Retrospective data were also sought from the other hospital emergency departments in Milwaukee County to evaluate the representativeness of the CHW data. Surveillance data were used to evaluate utilization of care by patient subgroups and to describe temporal patterns in emergency room visits. Results. Of the emergency department visits for asthma in Milwaukee County in 1993, CHW accounted for 94% among infants less than 1 year of age, 89% among children ages 1 through 5 years, and only 59% among children between the ages of 6 and 18 years. In 1994, the 7% of asthmatic children with repeat hospital admissions accounted for 38% of all hospital admissions for asthma and the 20% with repeat emergency department visits accounted for 50% of all emergency visits. Emergency visits for asthma showed clear seasonality, with a peak in the fall and a smaller peak in the spring. Conclusions. Computerized medical billing data provide an opportunity for asthma surveillance at a relatively low cost. The data obtained are useful for tracking trends in exacerbations of asthma and the use of medical services for asthma care and should prove valuable in targeting interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood. The prevalence of asthma is especially high in inner city children. The occurrence of asthma may be associated with many environmental factors, including involuntary exposure to maternal smoking. OBJECTIVES: This study reports prevalence of asthma and wheezing in a sample of public school students in Chicago and examines the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and childhood asthma. METHODS: A total of 705 fifth grade students from 13 public schools participated in the study. A slightly modified International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire was administered in classrooms to assess students' wheezing and asthma prevalence. RESULTS: Overall, 34.5% of children reported ever wheezing, 28.9% reported wheezing in the past year, 21.1% reported exercise-related wheezing in the past year, 23.6% reported physician-diagnosed asthma, 16.1% reported taking asthma or wheezing medication in the past 2 weeks, and 15.2% reported visiting emergency rooms for treatment of asthma in the past year. After adjusting for confounding variables in a logistic model, maternal smoking during pregnancy was significantly associated with children's asthma (adjusted odds ratio = 1.9; 95% confidence interval: 1.1 to 3.5). CONCLUSIONS: This study reports high prevalence of asthma and wheezing among the students and suggests that maternal smoking during pregnancy may increase the risk of asthma in children.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Improvement in the quality of life in the Western world and increased time spent indoors by children have enhanced the spread of house dust mites and increased the exposure time for sensitive children. Also, exposure to house dust mites in infancy and subsequent development of childhood asthma have been clinically linked. Recently, new acaricides have been developed. OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of the new acaricide (esdepallethin and piperonyl butoxide--'Acardust') combined with environmental control compared with continuous house dust mite avoidance measures. METHOD: Forty-six house dust mite-allergic, asthmatic children were evaluated for 6 months in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled study. Patients were randomly allocated to active and placebo acaricide treatment combined with avoidance measures, whereas only continuous avoidance measures were taken in the third group. Symptom score, medication usage, and peak flow measurements were recorded daily. The amount of house dust mite allergen in the dust vacuumed from the bedrooms was also measured. RESULTS: Morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates and forced expiratory volume in one second remained unchanged throughout the study period. In all groups, the symptom scores improved significantly, whereas the amount of house dust mite allergen decreased significantly at the end of the trial. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous house dust mite avoidance measures have a significant positive effect on the symptomology of children with mild or moderate asthma. 'Acardust' combined with continuous house dust mite avoidance measures is not more effective than continuous house dust mite avoidance measures alone in the treatment of house dust mite-allergic, asthmatic children.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of activated T cells and their cytokine products in the pathogenesis of childhood asthma. METHODS: PBMC were obtained from 17 symptomatic asthmatic children (age 7 to 15 yr) and 7 nonasthmatic controls matched for age and atopic status. Asthmatics were placed in 2 groups with initial prebronchodilator FEV1 <75% (Group I, n = 9) or >/=75% (Group II, n = 8) predicted. Expression of activation markers on peripheral blood T cells (asthmatics), and expression of cytokine mRNA (asthmatics and controls) were measured using flow cytometry and in situ hybridization respectively. Measurements were repeated in the asthmatics 3 to 6 months later following initiation or escalation of inhaled GC therapy for control of symptoms. RESULTS: The more severe (Group I) as compared with the milder (Group II) asthmatics showed evidence of increased peripheral blood T cell activation, with elevated percentages of CD4 cells expressing the activation markers CD25 and HLA-DR, and CD8 cells expressing CD25. Elevated percentages of CD4 cells also expressed CD45RO, consistent with ongoing cellular activation. The asthmatics had higher percentages of PBMC expressing mRNA encoding IL-5, IL-4, GM-CSF and IL-2, but not IFN-gamma, as compared with controls. The percentages of PBMC expressing IL-5 mRNA correlated with disease severity (% predicted FEV1). During follow up, patients in both groups required increased mean daily dosages of inhaled GC. In Group I this was associated with improvements in PEFR, FEV1 and night time wheeze and reduced percentages of CD4/CD25 and CD4/HLA-DR peripheral blood T cells. Reductions in the percentages of CD4/CD25 T cells correlated with improvements in baseline FEV1. Group II patients showed improvement in FEV1 and day time cough and wheeze but no significant changes in PEFR, other symptoms or peripheral blood T cell marker expression. Increased GC therapy of both groups taken together was associated with significant reductions in the percentages of PBMC expressing mRNA encoding IL-5, IL-4 and IL-2 and an increase in those expressing IFN-gamma mRNA. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with controls, children with symptomatic asthma have higher percentages of activated peripheral blood T cells synthesising cytokines believed to regulate bronchial mucosal eosinophilic inflammation. Clinical improvement with increased inhaled GC therapy is associated with reduced T cell activation and cytokine mRNA expression.

AB  - Asthma is a common chronic disease of childhood. Despite advances in treatment, the morbidity and mortality from childhood asthma continue to increase. Asthma is a frequent cause for school absences and visits to health care providers. The home health care nurse can play a vital role in helping children and parents learn to manage asthma, rather than allowing the asthma to manage them. Assessment and education are the keys to prevention of acute exacerbations of asthma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic surveys from different parts of the developed world are showing increases in asthma prevalence; the causes are not known. OBJECTIVE: To describe trends in prevalence of childhood asthma measured across serial cross-sectional surveys of the school age population of Bogalusa, Louisiana. METHODS: The Bogalusa Heart Study is a long-term epidemiologic study of risk factors for cardiovascular disease in children in a stable, semirural, biracial community. Part of the examination includes a parent-completed health history questionnaire. The item, 'Does your child have or has your child had in the past...asthma?' was included in the 1983-5, 1987-8, and 1992-4 surveys. Data analysis was restricted to subjects aged 5 to 17 years. RESULTS: Three thousand two hundred seventy-six subjects participated in 1983-5, 3256 in 1987-8, and 3128 in 1992-4. Reported asthma prevalence increased from 9.2% to 15.9% between 1983-5 and 1992-4. Maternal smoking was associated with asthma in all three surveys. Young age and African American ethnicity were associated with asthma only in the 1992-4 survey. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of asthma among the school age population of Bogalusa, Louisiana increased by 73% between the 1983-5 and the 1992-4 surveys. Whether the increase in asthma prevalence represents an increase in disease presence or an increase in disease recognition cannot be determined from these data.

AB  - A long-term evaluation of the process and outcomes of primary and secondary care is required to establish whether audit facilitators can improve the care of childhood asthma. To examine the long-term effect of an intervention by an audit facilitator on the management of children with asthma, and to investigate the implications for health service costs. A 4-year follow up was conducted of an intervention and control group totalling 2557 children aged 1-15 years from 12 general practices in the Tayside region. Primary care consultations, prescriptions, hospital contacts and health service costs 1 year before and 3 years after a facilitator visited practices were recorded. The facilitator encouraged the diagnosis and treatment of childhood asthma in the intervention group. Favourable changes in consultation patterns, prescriptions and reduced hospital admissions seen during the intervention year did not persist in subsequent years. Two and three years after the facilitator visit the process and outcome of care was similar in both groups. The reduction in health service costs seen in the intervention group was equivalent to the cost of employing a facilitator. The effect of a facilitator lasts only for the period of intervention. Enthusiasts will say that improving patient care without increasing health service costs justifies the widespread deployment of facilitators. Others more interested in long-term outcomes may disagree.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine differences in asthma management among families with a child who has moderate to severe asthma. Half of the 50 families chosen for study had participated in an intensive in-patient asthma treatment program and half had participated in an out-patient day camp. Two broad categories of outcome were examined -- illness and self-management skills. Families who participated in the in-patient program exhibited a pattern of illness behaviours which indicated asthma symptoms were better managed in comparison to those families that participated in the out-patient program. It was also observed that children who participated in the in-patient program had a tendency to feel more positive about having asthma with the more self-management behaviours they practised. On the other hand, children from the out-patient program reported a more negative attitude about having asthma with the more self-management behaviours they practised.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with asthma have been reported to be at increased risk for intraoperative bronchospasm. Current medical literature focuses on this problem in adult patients. This is a report of our experience in children. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to discern whether children with reactive airways disease (asthma) actually had a high likelihood of perioperative bronchospasm as the medical literature suggests. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 386 asthmatic children and 51 with bronchopulmonary dysplasia seen perioperatively between 1987 and 1992 was instituted. Children with asthma were classified as mild, moderate or severe based on the number of hospitalizations, emergency room visits, intensive care unit admissions and medications at the time of evaluation. Patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia were included in a separate category. Individualized asthma management was recommended for all patients in preparation for surgery. Blood gases, chest radiographs and pulmonary function studies were not routinely ordered. RESULTS: Only 3 of 437 children in a five-year period (0.13%) had intraoperative bronchospasm, easily controlled with the use of beta-2 agonists. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that asthmatic children appropriately prepared for surgery do not appear to have an increased risk for adverse outcome. The children treated with more than inhaled beta-2 agonists were those who had more severe asthma, recent viral infection, recent exacerbation of asthma, or recent hospitalization for asthma.

AB  - Severe childhood asthma is a serious, life-threatening disease that presents a challenge for patients, families, and caregivers. Despite evolving medical and pharmacologic therapies, the incidence and severity of asthma are increasing. Vasoactive substances are released in response to environmental and intrinsic triggers and result in bronchospasm, bronchial mucosal edema, and mucus plugging of the airways. Early recognition of symptoms and prompt, aggressive treatment, including oxygen, beta agonists, corticosteroids, and anticholinergic agents, are essential in halting the progression of asthma symptoms. In the most severe cases, intubation, mechanical ventilation, and treatment with anesthetic agents may be needed to avoid significant morbidity and mortality. This article reviews epidemiology, pathophysiology, and acute care of the child experiencing an acute asthma exacerbation.

AB  - An educational program known as the Childhood Asthma Project (CAP) was implemented to reduce morbidity among Hispanic children with chronic asthma. Seventy-three children, ages 6-16, participated in 4 program phases: baseline assessment, one-on-one child-centered education, application, and maintenance. During baseline assessment, child and parent asthma beliefs and behaviors were evaluated and used to create educational modules on symptom recognition, peak flow meters, medications, and precipitating factors in Spanish and English. Children learned the importance of self-management, practiced using inhalers and peak flow meters and charted peak flow recordings. Videotapes provided peer modeling by showing Hispanic children with asthma performing self-management tasks. During the application phase, patients practiced self-management behaviors at home and reviewed progress with a nurse educator. During maintenance, the success of self-monitoring was reviewed at follow-up appointments. Recommendations for designing health education interventions for Hispanic children are provided.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the relationship between psychosocial and behavioral factors and the frequency of emergency department visits for childhood asthma. METHODS: Data obtained from a survey of parents of 445 children who were being treated for asthma in the emergency room of a large urban hospital were examined. RESULTS: Factors associated with high emergency department use included the child's being of younger age, a greater number of days with symptoms of asthma, a higher number of asthma medicines prescribed, a prior hospitalization for asthma, a lower level of parental confidence in the efficacy of medicines, and a failure to use a criterion for deciding to seek emergency care. CONCLUSIONS: Younger children with asthma and children with previous hospitalization for asthma are at high risk for using emergency care. Families who use the emergency department frequently need to be further educated in the inflammatory nature of the disease, in the efficacy of proper use of medicine, in the need for ongoing care, and in criteria to distinguish those symptoms that can be handled at home from those requiring emergency care.

AB  - Parental smoking is hazardous to all children, especially those who have asthma. Passive smoke exposure can cause an increase in asthma symptoms, emergency department visits, and hospital admissions. Primary care providers must protect these children by helping reduce this exposure. This article describes the relationship between asthma and parental smoking, discusses the provider's role in encouraging smoking cessation, and offers practical alternatives for counseling parents who are unable to quit smoking. A hierarchical system of levels is used to help the provider educate the parents and give them a goal for which to strive.

AB  - Purpose: To describe the meaning childhood asthma has for mothers of afflicted children. Method: The qualitative method, ethnography, was used in this study. Participant observation and indepth interviewing took place in the homes of the participants. Using a method adapted from Spradley (1979), the analysis included uncovering domains, taxonomies, components of meaning, and finally cultural themes. Findings: The overall theme that emerged was 'mastering uncertainty.' The mothers expressed their experiences in terms of self by describing 'internal self' and 'actions' during a 'passage of time.' Conclusions: These themes can assist nurses and other health care professionals in understanding the meaning of childhood asthma to mothers.

AB  - The incidence of childhood asthma is on the increase with mounting pressure on health professionals caring for these children. Any attempt to develop services for children with asthma must address the problem of coordinating care between hospitals, GPs and community nurses, and should include the issue of parental involvement. This paper describes how a care pathway is used as a tool to promote partnerships of care between hospital, community and the family, and to coordinate the service.

AB  - Asthma is the most common chronic illness in childhood, affecting more than 2 million children annually. Although families have always been responsible for daily maintenance care, management of acute exacerbations of asthma are now coming within the province of home care management. The comprehensive family care approach discussed in this article incorporates environmental therapy, psychoeducational therapy, and medication therapy in a three-pronged approach to promote successful management of asthma episodes while working to reduce their incidence.

AB  - Most health visitors working in Britain today will have a number of children in their workload who are asthmatic. Parents and sufferers are often anxious to obtain more information to help their understanding and management of the condition. Doreen Deaves describes the results of a study which indicate that health visitors are ideally placed to provide health education and support for parents and families of children with asthma.

AB  - The rubric complementary therapy covers a variety of approaches that may seem alike only in their being outside conventional care and training. We have asked experienced practitioners to present their own pieces of this jigsaw, realising that these clinical fragments, when seen together, create excitement but also confusion. Of course, this forum is not intended to be a comprehensive review of relevant complementary treatments, and often the individual approaches to clinical problems will appear totally unrelated, while their apparent effectiveness stretches the biomedical model and conventional research methodology beyond their capacity. With this in mind, we intend that forthcoming articles and reviews will expand on the therapies themselves, and discuss the evidence supporting them.

AB  - Childhood asthma is a chronic health condition that affects more than 1 million school-age children and their families. Asthma is the leading cause of school absences and accounts for a substantial amount of activity limitation in children. A small pilot study of caretakers of African American and Hispanic school-age children with asthma explored the effects of the illness on families and the coping strategies used by caretakers. Large and significant correlations were found between the perceived impact in the areas of financial burden, social and familial isolation, and personal strain. Caretakers reported using active coping, planning, religion, and acceptance of the illness most frequently. The authors suggest the value of making conceptual distinctions between the burden imposed by the illness and the coping skills used by caretakers.

AB  - The primary health care team is at the forefront of asthma management and there is evidence of improved delivery of care via nurse run, audited, general practice clinics. However, hospital admissions for asthma continue to rise. Screening for childhood asthma would appear to have advantages for patient care. This review looks critically at the literature that addresses important issues in screening for childhood asthma, including the problem of defining asthma, its prevalence rate and the importance of dealing with asthma as part of a spectrum of illnesses of the upper respiratory tract. The fundamental principles of screening in relation to asthma are addressed, and five screening procedures are described and debated. Questionnaire studies are concluded to be relatively cheap and reliable, and a compilation of validated questions is described. Such questions could be tailored to individual practice needs and used in the early detection of asthma, giving the potential for early intervention and improved quality of life.

AB  - Screening for asthma in children in the community could have advantages at a time when prevalence rates of the condition and associated hospital admission rates are rising. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of a standard exercise test as a marker of asthma or potential asthma in children, and to examine the relationship between asthma and other respiratory tract illnesses. In 1985 a cross-sectional research study was undertaken in 10 primary schools in West Glamorgan; the children were followed up over six years until 1991. The exercise test involved measuring peak expiratory flow rate before and after the children ran as fast as they could for six minutes. A control group of children with a negative exercise test result were compared with those not known to have asthma who had a positive result (fall in peak expiratory flow rate of 15% or greater), using clinical data. Similar clinical comparisons were undertaken between the children known to have asthma and a control group. Of 864 children not known to have asthma, 60 had a positive exercise result. Of 92 children known to have asthma, 33 had a positive test result and seven were unable to finish the test because of bronchospasm, a sensitivity of 43% and a specificity of 93%. Follow up of 55 of the 60 children not known to have asthma but who had an abnormal response to the test showed that 32 had developed clinically recognizable asthma six years later. There was a significantly higher prevalence of atopic and respiratory illnesses (otitis media, hay fever and eczema) in the group of children with bronchial hyperreactivity demonstrated on exercise than in those without bronchial hyperreactivity. This research shows that bronchial hyperreactivity demonstrated by an exercise test can be a marker for childhood asthma. The study has also identified other respiratory tract illnesses which appear to belong to the same spectrum as asthma.

AB  - A research project, which looks at the value of health education in the prevention of childhood asthma, is described. The project was a controlled trial by a health visitor focused within the community. This exploratory research looked at three groups of children over a 2-year period, and compared the effect of: (a) individual health education, and (b) group health education. During the first year, two groups were active, one receiving individual health education, the other collecting data of the same type. During the second year, a third group was involved in health education sessions. The findings have been similar in both cases, in that both groups have demonstrated a good improvement in knowledge of asthma and its treatment. Through the active involvement of using a peakflow meter and diary records in the health education programme, both groups receiving health education have shown a significant improvement in the morbidity indicators related to night symptoms and restricted activities. The qualitative analysis of the research also highlighted the value parents of asthmatic children place on counselling.

AB  - In order to determine whether or not there was a relationship between disorders of growth in children suffering from asthma and either increased resting energy expenditure or inadequate energy intake, a group of 34 children suffering from perennial symptoms were studied. A control group matched with the asthmatic children for sex and fat free mass were similarly studied. The children kept seven day records of weighed food intake. Basal metabolic rate was measured on one occasion in the fasted state by means of indirect calorimetry using the ventilated hood technique. The asthmatic children kept a 28 day record of peak expiratory flow rates, asthma symptoms, and medication usage. The asthmatic children expended significantly more energy at rest than their matched controls in absolute terms (14%). There was no correlation between height or height SD score and any parameter of energy balance. The causes of these finding are as yet speculative.

AB  - To investigate the influence of indoor air quality on respiratory health, a questionnaire-based study of 17,962 Canadian schoolchildren in kindergarten through grade 2 was carried out in 1988. The present report focuses on associations between several indoor environmental factors and childhood asthma. Increased reports of physician-diagnosed asthma were significantly associated (p less than 0.001) with exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (OR = 1.4), living in a damp home (OR = 1.5), the use of gas for cooking (OR = 2.0) and the use of a humidifier (OR = 1.7). Wheezing without a diagnosis of asthma also was associated (p less than 0.01) with environmental tobacco smoke (OR = 1.4, home dampness (OR = 1.6) and humidifier use (OR = 1.4), but not with gas cooking. Thus, several modifiable risk factors for respiratory illness may exist in Canadian homes. Further research is required to determine the nature of these cross-sectional observations.

AB  - The aim was to examine the regional distribution of wheezing illness among British children, and the age at which geographical differences may be determined. Cross sectional analyses and study of interregional migrants were used. The subjects were national cohorts of British children born in 1958 and 1970. The regional distribution of wheezing illness showed significant heterogeneity at age 5 (1970 cohort) and 7 (1958 cohort). In both cohorts, children in Scotland had a low prevalence of wheeze, which could not be attributed to underreporting of mild cases. There was a less consistent tendency for high prevalence in Wales, and in the South Western and Midlands regions of England. In the 1958 cohort, the regional differentials diminished progressively with age and were negligible at age 23. There was a poor correlation between the regional distribution of childhood asthma and the common geographical pattern shown by eczema in infancy and hay fever at age 23. Analysis of interregional migrants suggested that the regional variation in each cohort at age 5-7 was primarily related to the region of current residence, and not to the region of birth. Genetic constitution, perinatal exposures, or early childhood experiences are unlikely to account for the regional variation in wheezing illness. Although local patterns of symptom reporting or disease labelling may be acquired by parents who move to a new region, environmental factors operating at a regional level probably determine the prevalence of asthma in primary school children. These influences do not appear to have long lasting effects upon the tendency to wheeze in adolescence and early adulthood.

AB  - In a questionnaire survey of a random sample of 1000 children aged 7 years, a significantly greater proportion of those living in homes reported as damp were affected by wheeze (22% v 11%), day cough, night cough, and chesty colds. Simultaneous estimation of relative humidity in the bedrooms of 778 children and continuous 7 day recordings of ambient temperature and humidity in a stratified sample of 317 bedrooms showed no association with the same respiratory symptoms. No correlation was found between bedroom conditions and baseline ventilatory function or exercise induced reduction in FEV1. These results run counter to the widely held belief that indoor temperature and humidity are important determinants of respiratory ill health, although they do not directly exclude effects due to mites or moulds, whose survival is determined by the humidity of their respective microenvironments.

AB  - This quasi experimental study attempted to determine whether problem solving skills needed by families for effective management of childhood asthma could be strengthened through direct cognitive strategy instruction. The problem solving instruction was added to a routine clinic-provided asthma educational program. An aim was to devise an instructional strategy for improving families' problem solving skills without requiring additional return visits for strictly educational purposes. Subjects included children aged 15 years or younger diagnosed with asthma who were making their first visit to the selected clinic, and their accompanying parent. Of the 42 families completing the study, 21 received the additional problem solving instruction and 21 received only the routinely provided asthma education. Outcome measures included the families' record of the child's asthma symptoms for 4 one-month periods following the instruction, Health Locus of Control scores and self-efficacy measures obtained pre-instruction and four months post-instruction for the participating parent, as well as the Children's Health Locus of Control measure for children age 7 years and above. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance revealed no difference between groups in symptom control, but symptoms decreased significantly over time (p =.002) with fewer symptoms reported at four months than at one month. The problem solving instruction had no significant effect on Health Locus of Control for parents or children nor upon self-efficacy ratings by parents. A 2 x 2 fixed analysis of variance (group by locus of control) of asthma symptoms revealed a significant interaction, p =.004. The experimental group children whose parents had an 'external' locus of control had a significantly greater decrease in symptoms than either experimental children with 'internal' parents or control group children with 'external' parents. The problem solving instruction, sampling technique, and data collection procedures are examined with suggestions for modification and recommendations for further study.

AB  - The incidence and prognosis of childhood asthma and wheezing illness (AW) was studied using data obtained at ages 7, 11, and 16 from a national cohort of 8806 children born in 1958. By the age of 16, 24.7% were reported to have experienced at least one episode of AW. In 18.3% AW had started before the age of 8, but only 4.2% continued to have symptoms in later childhood. A further 3.6% began to have AW between the ages of 8 and 11, and 2.8% began between the ages of 12 and 16. Of those with AW at age 7, 28.3% had symptoms at 11 and 16.5% at 16; these proportions were about doubled if AW at 7 had been severe. The associations between natural history and a large number of perinatal, social, environmental, and medical factors were examined. Those which predicted the onset of AW after the age of 7 were: male sex of child; mother aged 15-19 at child's birth; history of pneumonia, whooping cough, throat or ear infections or tonsillectomy; eczema, allergic rhinitis; and periodic vomiting or abdominal pain.

AB  - The relation between biosocial factors and childhood asthma in a British national sample (n = greater than 14 000) is examined. The presence of asthma was found to associate with sex of the child, parental age and occupation, housing type, and overcrowding as well as eczema and some infectious diseases. Discriminant analysis showed that it was possible to differentiate between asthmatics and non-asthmatics due mainly to allergy related factors.

AB  - The forced random noise method for measuring respiratory resistance was studied in terms of reproducibility and correlation with spirometry and flow volumes in 30 older children (four to 17 years) with asthma and in 16 infants and children below three years of age. In the 30 older children, the mean value of individual coefficient of variations for three repeated measurements was 7.4 percent. Resistance parameters correlated well with spirometric parameters with all but three correlation coefficients greater than 0.7. In 20 older asthmatic patients, 180 micrograms albuterol caused a significant reduction in resistance in 11 subjects. At the same time, FEV1 increased significantly in nine subjects but showed a paradoxic decrease in five. This paradoxic response is attributed to complex reflexes caused by the maximum inspiration and forced expiration and did not occur with resistance measurements. This method requires little subject cooperation, and therefore, is well suited for infants and children.

AB  - It is not possible to predict the plasma theophylline levels that can be achieved using slow-release aminophylline based on body weight or surface area. Improvement in FEV1 is directly related to increasing serum theophylline level, justifying the need for measuring levels in order to optimize therapy. As repeated venesection in children is unpleasant we have studied a simple method using saliva. Simultaneous blood and salivary theophylline levels correlated sufficiently well for salivary levels to be used for monitoring purposes. Urine levels did not correlate as well, but could be used for checking compliance.
